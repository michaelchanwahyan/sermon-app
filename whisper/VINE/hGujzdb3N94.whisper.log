[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I just also want to say that you're not able to plant a church unless your spouse is a supporter, so thank you, Chris.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I love you.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Well, hey, I want to update you on the amazing and incredible things that God has been doing in Yuen Long.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   So for those of you who don't know, in 2022, during the pandemic, we announced that we're planting a church.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And then in 2023, we, with a launch team of 35 people, we moved to Yuen Long and we started meeting in a preschool that was in the middle of nowhere.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   And then in October 1st, 2023, we had our public launch.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And so since then, we've been running in an amazing, incredible new venue that you helped make possible.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   So also thank you at this point for your generosity.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   If you haven't had a chance to come see it, you're always welcome to stop by and visit.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We would love to have you.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And so, yeah, but I want to share with you through pictures what's been happening.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   So let me share with you the first photo.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   So here, what you see right there is the church and they're praying for the children.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   The children are part of our worship.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   We have a lot of families.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   We love our families.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And so that has been incredible.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And I want to give a little bit statistics.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Now, church planting, it's always about people and individual stories.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But I think the statistics also say something.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So this will be the only point where I share that.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So we moved over 35 people at the beginning of 2023.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Our first service had 50 people attending.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Then when we shifted to our new venue, which was incredibly conveniently located,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   from October till December 2023, we had 166 people between our Cantonese and English service attending.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And then now in this year, we've been averaging 214 people, 49 children, you know, every Sunday.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So it really is incredible what God has been doing.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   If anyone would have told me that at the beginning, I would have said right away, "Yes, that sounds good."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   You know, if that's what God does.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So, yeah, praise God.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Now, next, I want to share with you a photo of K4CA from our children's ministry.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   The children love coming to our church community.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And you see here June, who is part of our pastoral team, doing an incredible job and volunteers.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And these are the three to five-year-olds there in their class.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And then next is a photo from Pastor Ivan.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And you can see him and his father.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So can we go to the next photo, please?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   You can see him and his father welcoming people and also weighing.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Now, since we have a Cantonese service, now father and son can attend the same service.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And so that's beautiful and amazing.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Now, one thing that happens sometimes is when we don't have people greeting and welcoming,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   people come up because they think we're a wine shop.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And we always love that foot traffic.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's great.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's always a good conversation.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So I think that has happened here before as well.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So it happens here as well.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So it's always good.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Then one thing that we've been doing, so you can go to the next slide, please,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   is we've been facilitating intentionally community and connection.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And so one way we do that is through Bring Your Own Lunch.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You see that there.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Once a month after a Sunday service, Cantonese and English service together, we have lunch together.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's Bring Your Own Lunch because we don't have much money.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And so people have to self-finance, but it's a great and incredible time.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And then we also pray for one another.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And so this is just like you do here.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   We have a lot of times, like ministry times, where we pray for one another.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And one thing that has been so amazing is just to see the people who God brings.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So we've had parents who want their children to have a Christian education,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and then their hearts are lit on fire for Jesus themselves.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So they come to know Jesus.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   We've also have had people that have gone through difficult and painful things.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And we had a sermon series called Longing for Healing.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And as they were coming, God was just speaking to them and was doing a healing work in their lives.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And so they went from not being sure about what they think about Jesus to following Jesus.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And so that has been amazing.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Those are just two of many stories.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And then finally, one of the things that we've been emphasizing this year is we're still establishing the church plan process.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And so one thing that we want to establish is that we're a church that loves and serves the city of Hong Kong.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And so that takes actually a lot of facilitation for that to happen.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So we had Young Lives with us last Sunday.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So you can go to the next slide, please.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And you see cats speaking, Young Lives, if you're not familiar with them.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   They work with teenage moms.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And so we're sharing about stories and how we can get involved.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And we're having playgroups with them in our settings.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   We're excited about that. It's just one example of a way that we're seeking to love, to serve our city.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And so life is amazing most of the time.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   God is amazing always.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And we're so incredibly blessed by what he has been doing.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I always feel like I have front row seats to what God has been doing in this time.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   It's amazing.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Now what I would love to do, I would love to pray for us before I go into our message for today.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So let's pray.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Jesus, thank you so much for bringing us here today together.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Thank you that you love every single person here.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And that you have brought us here today to hear from you through worship, through community, through your word, through your spirit.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And so we just want to surrender. We want to say, "Lord, speak to us."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   We want to hear from you.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And we want to say yes to whatever it is that you are talking to us about.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Amen.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   When I was in university, my senior year of university, I had quite an amazing senior year.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And it was a lot of spiritually quite rich experiences.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And one of them was I started this conversation with a childhood friend.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Now he was not a Christian, but we were talking about faith.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And this was almost weekly.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And he asked a lot of challenging questions.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   They were not easy conversations, but they were very enriching.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And it culminated with my friend coming to know Jesus, which was amazing.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And actually he's a pastor here in Hong Kong as well.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So I have my German buddy here.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And so for me, my senior year was something where I grew in faith.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And it was just incredible.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And then I graduated.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I started a job with Sherman Williams, a paint and coating manufacturer distributor.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   One of the largest ones in the world.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And at first things were going well.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Then the company moved me from central California.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   We had a lot of friends. I had a network.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I went one year to high school there.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   They moved me to the California coast, to Monterey.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And Monterey, if you don't know California, it's along the coast.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But for me, it actually turned out to be a really challenging time in my life
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   where I made a lot of bad choices that I'm not very proud of.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   You could also say I was living in habitual sin and just brokenness.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And so I went from this mountain peak experience my senior year in university
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and this first year of working coming out of college,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I found myself in this bottom pit in the valley.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And I was not the person that I wanted to be.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   I knew this was not the life I want to live, but I just was there.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I was stuck there.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   It was also not the life that God called me to live.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And I wanted to change.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I wanted things to change, but I didn't really know how or what to do.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So what do you do when you find yourselves in those places,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   when you're not living the way that you know God is calling you to live,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   when you're not the person that you want to be, what do you do?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Well, as you have been going through the series on Ephesians,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   God's word is quite clear, that especially in the chapters 1 through 3,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   it talks about how Jesus is saving, healing work in our lives.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   You know, that we were dead in our sins, but that we have been made alive in Christ.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And then last week, Pastor Andrew, he talked about that God has shaped a community,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   a church community, that it has become a maturing community,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   where we can grow, where we can change, where our lives can be transformed,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   where we can attain to the full measure of the wholeness of Christ Jesus.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   That we can start reflecting his character.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   That is amazing news, if you think about it.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Like, we can really change, we don't have to stay the same.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Now, I think that some of us here, maybe we have family history of whatever,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   broken relationship, addiction, and maybe we find ourselves stuck in that as well.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And perhaps we have bought into this lie that life cannot change,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   this is just the way it is going to be.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And so what God's word says, and also the church community,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   and the testimonies of people says, that you can change.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And so here at the Vine, we believe that Jesus has the power to transform and change your life.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And one thing I love, in Ephesians 2.10 it says this,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   which God prepared in advance for us."
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So that means that when God looks at you, he sees all your potential.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   He sees all that you can be that he created you for.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And his heart longs for that in your life to unfold.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   He desires to see that unfold in you.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And so he can bring that about, this transformation and change.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   So just really sense for the day that some of us,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   maybe we've gotten comfortable where we are,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   and today maybe the Holy Spirit is going to bring some conviction,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   and just calling us to something better.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   But for others of us, we've bought into the lie,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   where we're like, "I don't know if I'll ever change, I tried, but nothing happened."
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   And I believe that Jesus wants to say, "I can bring true change in your life.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   You do not have to continue in this way.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I can bring wholeness, where there's brokenness, where there's pain."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And so what I want to do with you today in this message,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I want to explore a question with you.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Because we all have a choice.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Do we remain in immaturity?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   You know, as Christians, where we live ineffective lives,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   actually last week, Pastor Andrew said something quite powerful.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   He said this, he said, "If the enemy can't keep you from being a Christian,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   then the next best thing for him to do is to keep you from being a mature and effective one."
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And so what I want to look with you at today is,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   how can we be a mature and effective Christian
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   and continue the conversation that Pastor Andrew started last week?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   How can we say yes to the Holy Spirit's transformed work in our lives?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Now what does it look like?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   How do we engage this change process,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   where Jesus just wants to bring wholeness into your life, into our lives, into my life?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Well, let me take you to Ephesians 4, starting with verse 17, it says this,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   "So I tell you this and insist on it in the Lord,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do in the futility of their thinking.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   because of ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, and they are full of greed.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   That, however, is not the way of life you learned,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   when you heard about Christ and were taught in Him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   You were taught with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   which was being corrupted by deceitful desires,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   to be made new in the attitude of your minds,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Now, this all starts out with Paul saying, "So..."
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   So all of this builds on what Paul has said before, and this is really important,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   because in the first three chapters of Ephesians,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Paul talks about the incredible saving work that Jesus has done.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   He talks about all the blessings that flow from Jesus.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   We're adopted, we're justified, we're made righteous,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   we're brought together as one family of God,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   and you create a new humanity, where people from all walks of life become a spiritual family.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And it's all these incredible things that Paul talks about,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   because he wants the Ephesians to understand their identity as Christians.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   They have a new identity, and they need to understand the love of Jesus,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   before he moves into how to now live.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Because how we live is always a response to the love, and the work, and the grace, and the mercy of Jesus.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   So that's always a starting point, so we have to keep that in mind as we go through the message today.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   So Paul is now telling the Gentile Christians that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Now that's interesting. He's talking to Gentiles, he tells them you must no longer live as Gentiles do.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   So what does he mean by that? Well, he doesn't want them to return to their old life, their old way of living,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   their old patterns of brokenness, of sinfulness.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He wants them to make a clean cut, and to live in a new way,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   because Jesus has done something new in them, they are a new creation,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   they've been given a new identity, and he wants them to live out that new identity.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   So verse 17 through 19, it describes basically their life before they knew Jesus.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And one of the main characteristics that Paul describes, and is asking them not to return to,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   is the futility of their thinking.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Because he knows that futile thinking leads to futile living.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Like how we think about something actually impacts how we live it out.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   And he doesn't want them to go back to their old ways of thinking.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Now the word futility, the Greek word "mateotis", means three things.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Futility, meaninglessness, and empty.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And Paul does not want Ephesian Christians to go back to empty, meaningless ways.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But if you think about the word futility, there's actually a lot of pain in that word.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Because if you're striving, if you're trying, but you never are satisfied,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   you never arrive, man, that's tiring.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   It's not a fun journey.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   And so Paul is saying, why would you return to that?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   To the striving, where you're never truly satisfied.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Maybe think, if I reach this achievement, then I'll be truly satisfied.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   So we chase after it, and then we have it.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And there is some satisfaction in it.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   But then soon we want the next achievement, because that one's not enough.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Or maybe we engage in a relationship, and we think that this relationship is going to satisfy us.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   But then it doesn't fully satisfy us, and so then we go into the next relationship, and so on and on.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   So it's this empty chasing.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   And so Paul says, why would you return to that?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Why would you go back to that?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I've given you a new life.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   I've given you a new identity.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   So then in verse 19, Paul says that ultimately this life, when we live in futility,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   and we go down that route, is a life where we're living in separation from God.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   It's a life apart from God.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And again, why would you go back to that?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   For me, when I was in Monterey, I went into an environment where I didn't know anyone.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   So I went back to my old life, to my old patterns, my old ways of living.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And sometimes there is comfort in that, but it never truly satisfies.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And so I went back to these patterns of brokenness, of selfishness, of sinfulness.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And for some of you that might be that way as well.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   That you've become a Christian, you've been given this new identity,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   but for whatever reason you've been going back to your old way of living.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And you're also like, I was at that point, you're not who you want to be.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   And you know you're also not who God is calling you to be, who has created you to be.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Because you're a new creation. He has something good, something beautiful for you.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Now, let's continue verse 20 and 21.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   So there it says, "That, however, is not the way of life you learned when you heard about Christ,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   and were taught in him accordance with the truth that is in Jesus."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So Paul and other leaders, they were teaching the new Ephesian Christians.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   They were teaching them what it means to follow Jesus.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   They were not teaching them a bunch of rules to observe.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   But it was centered around the person of Jesus.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Because our faith has to do with a personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And so they were teaching them how to live in a relationship with Jesus.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Instead of going back to like we're not in a relationship with Jesus.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Now this did involve the aspects that it talks about.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Truth that is in Jesus.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   That does refer to his historical life, where he's fully human, fully divine.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   But he did his miracles, his ministry, he died, he rose.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   All those things we do need to learn about.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   But ultimately, Paul was saying, "That's not what we taught you to go back to your old ways.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   We taught you to live in that relationship with Jesus."
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   So that's what he's inviting them.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Start relating again. Start engaging in that relationship again.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I think that's perhaps something that God is saying to some of us today.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Start engaging again in that relationship with Jesus.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Don't go back to that old way, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   So the essence of the Christian life is not a rigid set of rules.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   But a vibrant, transformative relationship with Jesus.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So as we grow closer to him and seek to honor him in all we do,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   we'll discover the true freedom and purpose found in walking with him.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   So that's Paul, he's reminding them of their identity.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   He's reminding them, "Hey, this is what you learned, this is what we taught you.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   This way of life. Now live this way of life. Don't go back to the old way of life."
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   But then he turns to, "How do we put on the old self, the new self, and renew the attitude of our minds?"
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So he turns to all of that. That's really what I want to focus on today.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Because I think that's really where this transformation, this change is found.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Where God's really telling us something. So let me read that, verse 22.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   "You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   which was being corrupted by its deceitful desires,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   to be made new in the attitude of your minds,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   and to put on the new self created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness."
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So Paul, in this, he's actually, I think, making a really important point.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Because he talks about putting off and putting on.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   What it points to is that even though we become Christians,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   there is still stuff in our lives that needs to be worked out.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   There are still things that are not fully there yet.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   There is still brokenness in our lives. There is still sin in our lives.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   This is true for everyone. We're living in this already but not fully yet part.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   So this is what Paul is talking about.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   And the word, the theological word for that is sanctification.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   So what I want to do is I want to talk about that,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   but I want to put it in a broader theological frame or conversation.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   The Bible talks about that we are saved, we were saved, we are saved,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   we are being saved, and we will be saved.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So like past, present, future.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And so when it talks about we were saved, it's talking about justification.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   When it talks about we are being saved, it talks about sanctification.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And when it talks about we will be saved, it talks about glorification.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Now let me unpack those a little bit.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   So justification is what Ephesians chapter 1 through 3 covers a lot.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   It's like Jesus died for your sins, you were dead in your sins,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   you were made alive in Christ by grace through faith,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and you are declared, you're justified, you're declared righteous.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   So there's like a legal metaphor that God has spoken this legal sentence over your life.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   When God now looks at you, he sees the righteousness of Jesus
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   in place of your sinful self that he has forgiven you for.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   So that's justification.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And let's move to glorification.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Glorification is when Jesus, when Christ has completed his saving,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   his healing work in your life.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   One day God's work with us will be completed,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   will be completely whole, there will be no more pain, no more tears.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And so that's glorification.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   But right now most of us we're living in a sanctification space
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   where we are more and more becoming who Jesus is calling us to be.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   We're not fully yet who we know we're meant to be.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   But God is not finished with us yet.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   He's not finished with you yet.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And he's working things out.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And sanctification is really about being made holy.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   It's about putting on the character of Christ,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   that we reflect Christ's character more and more.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And all the spheres of our influence, you know, on all parts of our lives.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   That when people look at you, they can see a bit more and more Jesus in you.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Because you can see your love, your grace, how you treat people.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   So that's what sanctification is about.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And that's what this passage is really talking about.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   So let's unpack that a little bit.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   So first in verse 22 it talks about,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   "You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self."
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Now putting off the old self can also be translated, "put off the old humanity."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Like we're, you know, we were saying earlier, "death to death."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   You know, we died to being dead in our sin.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We've been raised to new life.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   And so we're meant to keep putting that off.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   We don't always live in the victory that Jesus has won.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   But we're meant to put this off.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Now what does it mean to put off our old self?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And what does that actually mean?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Well, it's like turning away from our sinfulness, our brokenness.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   It's like coming to Jesus and saying, "Jesus, this is what's going on in my life.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Help me.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   I know I'm not who I want to be.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   I know I'm not who you want me to be.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   But help me to be that person."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   It also has to do with the word "repentance,"
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   where we turn from whatever we're doing that we know doesn't honor God
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   and say, "Jesus, I don't want to live this way anymore.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Forgive me.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Help me now from this point forward to live by your grace, by your power, by your strength."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   That's what putting off our old self means.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And it happens in that relationship with Jesus that Paul taught the Ephesians.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   You do that in a relationship.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   It happens with that intimacy of Jesus that we've been talking about.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   But notice this too also talks about the old self as being corrupted by deceitful desires.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   So it's a life that seems to be good and enjoyable, but really it leaves us empty-handed and broken.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   It's like false advertisement.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   You think you're getting something good, but you find yourself in shambles and more pain.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And some of you may feel that way.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   On the one hand, you're excited to be here.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   You're like, "Man, I love worship.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I love Jesus.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   I love this community, and it's so good always to be here."
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   But then on the other hand, you haven't been--you're still stuck in patterns of the past.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   You've returned to part of your old life, and you live in some of that brokenness.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   So what do we do?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Well, this passage actually provides an answer, a solution for us, and I want to continue to unpack that.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   That's also where we can start addressing our question.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   So how do we say yes to the Holy Spirit's transforming and healing work in our lives?
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   How do we say yes to that, that we can experience that change, that we can become more Christ-like,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   that we don't have to stay the same person?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Maybe the ugliness that's in our heart or in our actions, maybe it's anger, whatever it may be,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   we don't have to stay there, and we can experience this transformation.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So here it goes.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   While Christ has defeated sin on the cross, we don't always live in that victory.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And so putting on and putting off is actually daily discipleship, it's daily relationship with Jesus.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And so we've already talked about the putting off part, but then in between the putting off the old self
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   and putting on a new self, there's another line, so I want to look at that with you.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   It says that we, it says this, "to be made new in the attitudes of your mind."
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   So God wants to do some renewing of our mind so that we're not stuck in the futility of our thinking.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And the Greek verb "to be made new," it's in a passive voice, and what that means is
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   that we're not the agents that make ourselves new.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   We do not renew ourselves, but God is the agent of renewal.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And I think that's really important for us to know, that whether it's with justification,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   sanctification, glorification, it is always 100% the work of God in our lives.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And He's the one that changes and renews us. It's His power. It's not us. It's not your effort.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And I think sometimes we get stuck in our own efforts, where we try to make stuff happen out of our own
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   and we fall short. But we need to learn to surrender and rely on the power of God
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   to bring about this change, because He's the one who changes us. We don't do that ourselves.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   But we are given part in the process where we can say yes to the Holy Spirit's work,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and that's the putting off and the putting on. Now what does putting on mean?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Putting on, just very simply, means putting on the new self as obedience to Jesus.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   That we do what Jesus says. That we do what the Holy Spirit is revealing to us.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   And we don't always feel like that at first, but that's what putting on the new self means.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   So God has given us this picture, and this actually comes from our daily putting on clothes and taking off clothes.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Take off the dirty clothes, put on the fresh clothes. That's what this imagery is about and comes from.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And when we do that, we start reflecting more and more the true righteousness and holiness
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   that we've been created for. We give God, we give the Holy Spirit a space in our lives to move
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   and to transform us as we put off the old self and we put on the new self.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And in that process, the Holy Spirit renews us and conforms our image more and more to Him.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And that's how we say yes to the Holy Spirit's work.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It's through daily putting off our old self and putting on the new self.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Now, through the imagery of putting off the old self and putting on the new self, Paul is saying,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   become what you are. Live in line with your new identity that you have been given.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   You're children of God. Now reflect God. Reflect your heavenly Father.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   That's your identity. Your new identity.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Now, you might again still wonder, like, well, what does that look like?
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   So I want to share a little bit with you.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   When I was in university, I struggled really with one person that I knew.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Different personality. There was nothing wrong with him.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Just different personality. Personality clash.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   And there was a lot of judgment in my heart towards him.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   There was a lot of lack of grace.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   You know, as Christians, we've been shown grace by Jesus.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   But then sometimes we turn around and we don't show grace to other people.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Well, that was what was happening.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And I knew I had a bad attitude, a bad way of thinking and feeling about this other person.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   And I wasn't honoring God. And I was not the person I wanted to be.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   But at that point, I wasn't admitting that to myself yet. I hadn't gotten to that.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So I received a package from my parents from Germany.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   It was around Christmas, a little bit before Christmas.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It was amazing, German chocolate.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And so he comes into the room and I'm eating some chocolate.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   And he's like, "Oh, I love chocolate."
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   He's like, "German chocolate is my favorite chocolate."
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And I said, "Nein! Du kriegst keine Schokolade. You're not getting any chocolate."
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   So I didn't say that.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   But I knew what he was asking for.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But I pretended like I didn't understand.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So I just kept eating my own chocolate.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   It was not very nice.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Another occasion, I was trying to walk to class.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   And I was rushing to get there.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And so he was blocking the hallway.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   And he's like, "You first got to fight me if you want to get past me."
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Now, he was saying this in a playful way.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   So this was not like he was not really trying to fight me.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   So he was just trying to relate to me and engage me.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And he's like, "You first got to fight me."
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And I was like, "I don't want to fight you. I just actually want to go to class."
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Again, this German anxiety about not being late.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It's like the biggest sin in Germany is to be late.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   So I'm so anxious.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   And so I asked him several times.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And he didn't understand that I was serious.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And so I put him down on the ground.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   I was like, "I'm sorry. I really need to go to class."
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   So I went to class.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   So there's just some personality things where it's just really struggling with that relationship.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Now, fast forward a year.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I signed up for a Christian community group on campus.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   So I had no idea who I was going to be placed with.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   So I show up to our first meeting. The leader had called me.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   I show up. Guess who's there.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I felt like quitting right there when I saw him.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But then the Holy Spirit convicted me in my heart.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   I knew that my feeling and my attitudes towards him were not right.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And I was not who I wanted to be.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And I was not who God had called me to be.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   And so I knew that God was asking me to stay in this group.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And that there was something I needed to learn.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Even though I didn't feel like it.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   But in this instance, I said yes.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   So I ended up bringing my feelings, my thoughts, and prayer before Jesus.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Asked for patience and grace over all of this.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And I also did what God was asking me to do, which was go to those meetings.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   So you see in this, there's the putting off.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Like I was acknowledging my feelings that were not right.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And I was asking Jesus to help me with this.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I'm giving this to you.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   I know I'm not feeling, thinking about this the right way.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And then there was the putting on.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   The actually doing what was right.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   To keep going. To be there. To listen.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   This went on for two years.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And I can truly say that after two years,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   it wasn't a chore for me to go to this community group anymore.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I loved the people there. I loved my brother.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And my heart had genuinely changed.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   It was transformed.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Now I could not do this out of my own strength.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   But it was the power of God working in my life.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Changing my heart and my attitude.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Now if I would listen to IG influencers or YouTube influencers,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   they just tell you, do you.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Now if I would do me in this instance,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I would not go through all of that stuff.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   I would not make myself do something I don't feel like doing.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   So we have to remember, what does all of this flow out of?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Well it's because of the love and grace of Jesus that he has shown me.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   It's the work of the Spirit of God in my life.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And me just wanting to love Jesus back.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And being the person that he has called me to be.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   That's where all of this always flows from.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It always flows from there.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And I just want to invite you here today.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   As I have been sharing about putting off and putting on our new self,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   putting off our old self.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Like what things the Holy Spirit has been bringing to your mind.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   What he has been speaking to you about.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And I just want to create some space right now where you can come yourself before Jesus.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Can respond to him in a way that he is inviting you to respond.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I don't want you to play down this moment.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Like we sometimes we treat things like this casually, yeah whatever.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   No, Jesus has the power to change and transform your life.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   He has the power to change and transform your heart.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   I believe he wants to release some faith in us.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   That he can do this work.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   So I have two questions up there to help us prayerfully reflect.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   What are some areas in your life where you need to put off your old self and put on your new self?
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And the second one is what are the parts of your life we are longing for God's healing and transforming work?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Because a lot of times where we are living in our old self there is actually a lot of brokenness.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   We just want, we need God's love, we need God's healing.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   So I just want to invite you right now for a couple of minutes just to pray,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   to come respond to the Holy Spirit's leading and then I'll pray over us.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   So let's do that right now.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Let's take this time to pray.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.160]   [MUSIC]
