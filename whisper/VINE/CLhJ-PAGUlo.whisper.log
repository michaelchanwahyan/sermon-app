[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.240]   It is such a treat to be here
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.080]   and to share God's word with you
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.200]   and yeah, and just to worship together.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.560]   As Andrew said, Marian and I delight
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.120]   in worshiping here every Sunday.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.400]   And every Sunday, God says something, speaks to us.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.800]   And we normally sit over kind of in this area over here
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.520]   where Sarah and Raul, a little bit this side of Carl.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.200]   And it's not a special place, of course.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.300]   He'll speak to us in any part of the room.
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.400]   But God speaks.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.500]   And one of the things I believe he's saying this morning
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.700]   is just how much he loves you.
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.480]   And that when he looks at you, he sees something of beauty.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.780]   So before we start in anything, know that.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.840]   Know that God is here and he speaks.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.480]   Now, when, I was gonna call you Father Andrew,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.360]   but you're Pastor Andrew.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.560]   Hello.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.560]   When Pastor Andrew asked if I would preach last month,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.480]   I had to really think about it for a little bit
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.120]   because I knew that February was gonna be a very tough time
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.640]   for the work at the university.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.720]   And so I told him I'd go away and pray about it
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.560]   and think about it.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.960]   So I went away, prayed about it and thought about it
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.680]   and thought about it some more.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.440]   And, but you know, it's very difficult
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.840]   to say no to Pastor Andrew.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.200]   And it's especially difficult to say no to Pastor Andrew
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.760]   when the Holy Spirit gives you a title of yes
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.600]   in your sermon.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.920]   And that's what we're talking about today, getting to yes.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.560]   Because as I prayed, I felt this was the topic,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.920]   getting to and staying at yes.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.880]   The, what that means exactly for each one of us,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.840]   I think as a community globally and here in Hong Kong,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920]   we're coming out of a period of no, a season of no,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.120]   where it was no, lots of restrictions.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.480]   And now we're emerging into this season of yes.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.360]   But what does that look like?
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.440]   And what does it look like for you
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.600]   in your getting to yes with God?
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.120]   Because that's what we're focusing on.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.960]   For some of us, it might mean this morning
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.040]   that that might be the big yes to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.760]   Maybe you're here and you haven't yet said yes to Jesus.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.960]   And my prayer is that you would,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.640]   because there is so much joy
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.840]   and a beautiful journey awaiting you.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.120]   It may be that you've said yes,
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.720]   and probably for most of us, it is we have said yes.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   But maybe there are pockets of our lives that are nos.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.800]   And on this first Sunday of Lent,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.720]   as we make our way to Easter,
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.880]   what would it look like to be all in,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.480]   to be completely a yes?
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.720]   What would it look like for parts of your lives,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.600]   which may be a no, to be positioned, repositioned as a yes?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.520]   Or maybe it's a situation.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.760]   Maybe it's in a relationship,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.840]   and you're feeling God is leading you to a yes.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.920]   Or maybe He's leading you to yes to wait on a relationship.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.040]   Or maybe it's something at work.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.240]   Last week, Pastor Andrew preached on courage.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.240]   And maybe you feel God's leading you somewhere,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.440]   but it's a bit scary, and you need that courage.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.680]   I don't know what it is.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.480]   But I do know this, that getting to yes,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.240]   truly getting to yes, not just with our mind
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.600]   and with our word, but with our heart,
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.360]   is sometimes difficult.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.800]   So that's what we're gonna talk about today,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.320]   is how do we get to yes in those challenging areas?
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.240]   In the 1990s, Marian and I lived in London.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.960]   We went to Alsos Church, and John Stott was there
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.800]   different times during that period.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.280]   And one night, he just mentioned kinda casually offhand
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.880]   that Peter, three times, had said no to Jesus.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.320]   Once on the road to Jerusalem,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.760]   once in the upper room at Jerusalem,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.000]   and once in a small town of Joppa.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.360]   And at the time, it just kinda stuck away.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   I thought, that's kind of interesting.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.160]   But in the last few months, as I've been going through
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.840]   a particular challenging part in my life,
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   I have found these times to be encouraging and challenging
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.800]   to help me begin to shift, as Peter did,
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.080]   his no's to a yes.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.200]   So what I'd like to do this morning is to do that,
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.320]   to look at the scripture, to look at how Peter said no,
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.360]   but then eventually was able to say yes,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.640]   in the hopes that it might encourage you.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.280]   And in the hopes that it might move us all to a yes
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.000]   as we get ready for Vision Sunday,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.360]   as we go into this Easter Lenten journey.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.400]   Does that sound okay?
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.120]   - Yes. - Yes.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.960]   - Yes. - Good.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.840]   It's kinda hard to say no, isn't it?
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.800]   All right, so I'll be, no.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.240]   Okay, so we'll go to the scripture.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.520]   But before we go to the scripture,
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.680]   as Andrew said, that I work with a group
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.760]   at University of Hong Kong, HKU,
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.280]   called Faith and Global Engagement.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.840]   Work with Carl there.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.520]   A couple of our other people were here
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.000]   earlier in the morning, but Faith and Global Engagement.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.360]   And the area that I work on the most is,
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.640]   as Pastor Andrew said, character leadership.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.520]   Now, a good part of character is reflection,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.960]   that you have to reflect on your character
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.280]   as your character step-by-step strengthens.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.200]   So what we're gonna do is,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.920]   I thought I'd show you a little bit of
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.000]   what we are at Lead for Life as a program.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.640]   So if we go to that slide.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.520]   This is actually a photograph that was taken last weekend,
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.040]   just this last Saturday.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.520]   Now, some of you may recognize your faces in there
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.200]   because there are a number of you from the Vine
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.240]   who are leaders, who are mentors in the program.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.600]   And you'll see there right in the middle, our neon sign,
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.920]   and behind our neon sign, a Benedictine monk.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.400]   Now, what is a Benedictine monk doing there at HKU?
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   So the topic was meditation, wellness, and leadership.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.120]   Because we don't often connect meditation and leadership,
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.080]   and yet the best leaders are reflective,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.720]   they're contemplative.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.680]   So we try to teach our students how to reflect well.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.240]   And we use an iceberg metaphor.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.240]   So as we look at this iceberg metaphor,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.160]   then you'll see that there, there's your iceberg,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.400]   and then the reflection reactions on the right.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.640]   Now, our senior research director,
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.160]   our project manager at Faith and Global Engagement,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.000]   Hualun, he does a great job at getting people to understand,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.800]   getting students to understand how do you reflect on things.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.600]   And the reason I'm saying this to you
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.280]   is because I want us to use this tool
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.200]   to reflect on Peter's nose,
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.920]   so that we can really reflect in our lives
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.280]   and see what they have to teach us.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.080]   So basically, at the very top,
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   and we all know that the iceberg metaphor
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.520]   is you only see the tip of the iceberg, right?
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.080]   The bulk of the iceberg is below the surface.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.240]   And that's how it is with our lives too, right?
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   People only see a tip of us,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.160]   but the bulk of us is in our heart.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.360]   And that's where the heart of the matter is.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.600]   And that's where change happens, okay?
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.120]   But if you go through, first of all,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.040]   you come across a topic and it looks interesting.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.120]   So you say, hmm, that looks interesting.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.800]   So hmm, three nose from Peter,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.880]   that might be interesting, right?
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.520]   And then you go to the ah.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.760]   And the ah is, that could be useful.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.000]   That could be useful.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.800]   So maybe when I look at the three nose of Peter,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.480]   it might be useful for an area in my life
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.800]   where I have a no, right?
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.640]   Now, when Walloon does this with us,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.480]   he makes us do the noises.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.640]   He makes us do the sounds.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.520]   Okay, so you guys ready for this?
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.760]   11 o'clock, you've already had your coffee.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.920]   You're good to go, right?
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.320]   Okay, so when we see something might be interesting,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.920]   we say, hmm, that's interesting.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.000]   And then we go down to the ah.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.440]   That might be useful.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.920]   But now we gotta go below the water, right?
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.960]   And when we go below the water,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   we get to that moment that we all have heard of, aha.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.120]   Okay, so it goes, hmm, ah.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.120]   Aha, you guys are brilliant, you're real.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.160]   Definite material for character leadership.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.280]   We'll sign you up.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.160]   And the aha is where we're going to be going today
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.280]   because we're gonna be going below the surface.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.200]   We're gonna be going,
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.680]   we're gonna be looking at the surface scriptures.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.760]   We're gonna be looking at hopefully something that's useful
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.080]   but where we want to go is into our hearts
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.800]   because that's where the Holy Spirit works
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.120]   and that's where true joy and beauty
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.960]   and fullness and flourishing and all that happens.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.960]   So using this, let's go on now to the three times
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.200]   that Peter said no.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.120]   So the first one we'll look at
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.120]   is found in Matthew 16, 21 to 23.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   And here, basically, Peter is saying no to the cross.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.640]   And so as we read this, it says, from that time on.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.040]   So you might wanna just keep that phrase in your mind,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.080]   from that time on.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.000]   From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.400]   that he must go to Jerusalem
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.920]   and suffer many things at the hands of the elders,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.640]   the chief priests and the teachers of the law,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.680]   and that he must be killed
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.200]   and on the third day be raised to life.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.600]   Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.480]   Never, Lord, he said.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.400]   This shall never happen to you.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.160]   And Jesus turned and he said to Peter,
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.520]   get behind me, Satan.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.520]   You are a stumbling block to me.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.480]   You do not have in mind the concerns of God,
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.360]   but merely human concerns.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.960]   Okay, never a good position
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.440]   when Jesus is calling you Satan, right?
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.720]   But what can we learn from this?
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.440]   Now, remember, these are friends,
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.000]   and friends have a beautiful way
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.880]   of talking directly to each other.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.800]   And they are talking very directly to each other.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.920]   And there is a direct exchange between the two.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.960]   But what can we learn?
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.960]   I think to learn, we need to go back a few passages earlier.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.600]   On the road to Jerusalem,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.920]   this is leading up to the crucifixion.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.880]   This is the last time Jesus is going to Jerusalem.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.560]   On the road earlier, Jesus had turned to his disciples
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.480]   and he had asked the question, who do people say I am?
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.160]   He's something of a celebrity, crowds are coming,
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.400]   and he wants to know, who do people say that I am?
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.160]   And the disciples say, well, some say that you're Elijah,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.960]   and others say you're a prophet.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.760]   And then Jesus asks the core question for all of us.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.000]   And he says, who do you say that I am?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.480]   And Peter says, you're the Messiah.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.440]   You're the son of God.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.640]   You're our Messiah.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   And Jesus says, blessed are you, Peter,
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.880]   because that was revealed to you.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.440]   Now, that's just a few passages earlier, right?
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.040]   And then we hit this moment, this big no.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.400]   So what is Peter saying no to?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.720]   I believe Peter is saying no to Jesus when he says,
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.680]   no, that's not how the Messiah works.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.600]   You don't know how the Messiah works, Jesus.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.840]   Yes, you're the Messiah, but this is not how it works
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.040]   with crucifixion, with the suffering,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.440]   with people turning on you.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.440]   This is not how it works.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.520]   Basically, what Peter is saying no to
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.720]   is he's saying no to the way of the cross.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.160]   He's actually saying no to the way that got all of us here.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.880]   So he's saying no to a big thing.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.160]   And he's saying no to the cross
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.280]   because he's saying no to the how.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   And I get this because I say no the same way.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.360]   I often say no to the how of God is working.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.800]   And often it's because it's the way of the cross.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.120]   Sometimes I'm like the proverbial CEO or leader who says,
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:22.360]   he says, let's all work together and do it my way.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.840]   And I kind of feel that sometimes with God, right?
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.000]   Maybe you've worked with one of those leaders,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.880]   but I feel that way sometimes with God.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.560]   It's like, okay, God, let's work together and do it my way.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.280]   But that's not how God works, fortunately.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.880]   And where do we go from there?
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.460]   I find this really challenging in a specific area of healing.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.720]   In the area of healing.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.200]   I grew up born, raised in Nigeria.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.160]   My parents were medical missionaries.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   I believe in the power of healing
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.960]   through the medical practices and the gifts of healing
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.000]   that are given to our medical people.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.760]   I believe also in the Bible and the stories that I see
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.560]   of people bringing people to Jesus to be healed.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.300]   But whether you bring them to a hospital
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.440]   or you bring them directly to Jesus,
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.000]   you're bringing them ultimately to God.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.640]   And this last year has been a tough one.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.240]   My dad's 96.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.720]   He's an amazing man.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.160]   He's kind of like a Caleb
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.880]   and take the next mountain type man,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.400]   but he's 96 and he's been going through some challenges.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.420]   My brother also was in the hospital
[00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.300]   with some very tough times.
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.040]   Had other areas in our family and in our extended family
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.760]   where we've been crying out and saying,
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.640]   "God, this is not how it works.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.680]   "God, this is how it works.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.360]   "I'll quote you your word, God."
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.120]   And say, "Your family gets sick,
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.440]   "you bring them to God and they get healed."
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.320]   But it wasn't kind of working that way
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.100]   because God is God.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.820]   And as I was looking and struggling this
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.760]   and Mary and I were going through some of this stuff,
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.140]   then I thought about when our kids were growing up.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.000]   We were blessed to have three adult children.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.980]   And when they were growing up, we prayed for them.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.020]   Mary and I prayed for them
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.620]   that they would become people of character.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.240]   We wanted them to be strong strength character,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.160]   people of character.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.140]   Kids being kids, they got into all types of trouble, right?
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.820]   And got into all types of situations.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.080]   Some of them not of their own, it's just life, right?
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.660]   But they would get into challenging situations.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.820]   And so when they would get in those challenging situations,
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.780]   we would pray, "God, get them out of that situation quickly."
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.060]   And we would pray for them,
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.060]   make them children of character.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.220]   And at some point I felt like God was saying to me,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.880]   "What do you want?
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.680]   "Do you want them to be children of character
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.800]   "or do you want me to take them out of the place
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.000]   "where they're gonna learn their character?"
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.560]   And so Marian is a much quicker learner than I am.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.180]   And so together we begin to learn
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.980]   that maybe there's a different way to pray.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.340]   Maybe we can pray a how prayer
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.200]   when we don't understand God's how,
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.760]   but maybe it's a different how.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.260]   And so I wanted to offer you this prayer.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.040]   It's a short one, but it goes like this,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.020]   "Lord, how do you want me to pray?"
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.980]   And then that begins to shift things a bit.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.440]   There's a beautiful 14th century classic
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.760]   called "The Cloud of Unknowing."
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.500]   And in there he says, "Short prayers pierce heaven."
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.640]   Short prayers pierce heaven.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.440]   Can I hear an amen?
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.820]   I pray too long sometimes.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.040]   But short prayers, particularly in these situations,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.360]   there's a time for all prayers,
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   but there's, particularly in this situation,
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.840]   this short prayer, "Lord, how do you want me to pray?"
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.520]   Because here's what it does.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.080]   It begins to open up and shift things.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.940]   Earlier when we were praying,
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.960]   Andrew had a picture of this car in a parking lot
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.820]   that was kind of trying to get out
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.860]   of a very narrow Hong Kong parking place,
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.920]   and it was on this 20-point turn, back and forth,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.080]   couldn't get out, right?
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.880]   And it kind of is a picture for maybe some of us.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.240]   We may feel stuck.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.460]   We may feel stuck in one of these situations.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.640]   This may be where your no is.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.700]   It has been for me.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.120]   But then when you begin to pray,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.440]   how do you want me to pray?
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.400]   How should I pray, God?
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.120]   Then it begins to unleash something in us,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.280]   this hope and this courage.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   If we look again at the passage,
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.400]   there's this beautiful truth
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.680]   that Jesus says to Peter at the end,
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.520]   "You are a stumbling block to me."
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.720]   And then he says this,
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   "You do not have in mind the concerns of God,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.860]   "but merely human concerns."
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.360]   Now think about that for a moment.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.940]   God has concerns.
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.780]   Have we asked him what his concern is?
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.800]   Because sometimes we're caught up in our human concerns,
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.400]   and these may be very good human concerns,
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.900]   a family member that needs healing.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.040]   But it's a beautiful thing when we can say,
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.660]   "Lord, how do you want me to pray?
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.080]   "What are you concerned about?"
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.000]   And then it begins to open things up.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.120]   That was Peter's first no.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.680]   Okay, let me pause there.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.360]   Is this making sense?
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.080]   Yeah, it's okay?
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.560]   It's good, you're still saying yes?
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.560]   Okay, all right, that's good.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.640]   So let's go on to the second one.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.200]   This one happened on the road to Jerusalem.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.560]   The next no happens actually in Jerusalem.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.440]   And that next no comes from John.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.220]   And John chapter 13, three through eight.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.240]   And this no is taking place in the upper room.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.860]   So they're in Jerusalem, night before crucifixion,
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.380]   and it's the foot washing.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.300]   So we have here, "Jesus knew that the Father
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.260]   "had put all things under his power,
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:23.260]   "and that he had come from God and was returning to God."
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.740]   Okay, I'm just gonna pause there.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:29.260]   That is a beautiful description of Jesus as our leader.
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.360]   He had all power.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.620]   And he knew where he would come from
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.560]   and where he was going.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.220]   He was grounded, right?
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.060]   And then in this power, he picks up the towel,
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.680]   the symbol of service.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.080]   That's something we're trying to help our students
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.740]   understand, that it's the powerful that serve.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.840]   It's the powerful that are able to do that.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.560]   Thomas Merchant says, "The sign of humility is strength."
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.820]   And it's okay.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.180]   So that's a different sermon.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.060]   I'll go into that in a later one.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.780]   But I want you to understand that
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.020]   because this is the context where then Jesus,
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.580]   then it says, "He poured water into a basin,
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.660]   "and he began to wash his disciples' feet,
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.640]   "drying them with a towel that was wrapped around him.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.900]   "He came to Simon Peter, who said to him,
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.720]   "Lord, are you gonna wash my feet?
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.340]   "And Jesus replied, you do not realize now what I'm doing,
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.400]   "but later you will understand.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.460]   "No, said Peter, you shall never wash my feet.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.440]   "Then Jesus answered, unless I wash you,
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.140]   "you have no part with me."
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.960]   Okay, strong exchanges again, right?
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.580]   Don't you love Peter?
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.020]   It's rarely just a no.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.220]   You know, it's a never, not, whatever, you know?
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.680]   There's something going on here.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.240]   And there's something in his vehemence.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.700]   You'll see this in the third note too.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.200]   Because I think what's going on here
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.360]   is it's touching something below the waterline.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.240]   This is now getting down to the heart.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.060]   Something is changing with Peter.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.260]   Do you remember those first four words I was talking about?
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.980]   From this time on, he began to teach.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.180]   In other words, he started changing his teaching,
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.340]   and Peter was struggling to catch up
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.540]   because that's not what we had talked about before.
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.140]   Here, it's normally the servant in a night like this.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.820]   At the Passover, who would serve them.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:32.620]   But now it's Jesus, and things are changing.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.820]   And change is hard, and it cuts to the core.
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.640]   And we wanna say no immediately,
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.400]   when maybe we need to say yes.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.660]   And that's a little bit what's going on here.
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.620]   But honestly, I don't know what Peter is saying no to.
[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.820]   I'm not sure, really.
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.340]   At first I thought, well, he's saying no
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.340]   because he doesn't want to become this type of Messiah
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.820]   that's gonna lead and get down on the ground
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.200]   and wash people's feet.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.420]   Because if he's doing it, I'm gonna have to do it too.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.540]   But maybe it's not that simple.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.820]   Maybe he doesn't wanna be served by Jesus.
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.240]   And that's the gospel, right?
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.340]   The gospel's not only giving love, but it's receiving love.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.580]   And if we can't receive love, we can't give.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.260]   And if we can't give, we can't receive.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.060]   If we can't serve others, we can't be served.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.420]   If we can't be served, we can't serve others.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.700]   I think maybe that's it, but I'm not sure.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.400]   Sometimes we used to have foot washing services,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.620]   and no one wanted to take off their shoes
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.300]   because they didn't like their feet, right?
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.140]   Maybe this Peter is like, "I don't think so, not tonight."
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.140]   But I think there's something going on here, D.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.740]   What I do know, what I do know
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.700]   is that Peter is not tracking with what's going on.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.900]   He's not understanding what's happening.
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.140]   And the way we know that is because Jesus says that.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.580]   He says to him, "You do not realize what I'm doing,
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.660]   "but later you will understand."
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.940]   You don't realize what I'm doing, Peter,
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.260]   but later you will understand.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:17.260]   In other words, Jesus is saying, "Trust me, trust me."
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.900]   And this is the next prayer, and it's a very simple prayer.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.420]   It's a prayer that says, "Lord, help me to trust you."
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:32.320]   The word trust has been at the front of my prayer journal
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.220]   for the last 14 months, and I'm still learning.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.820]   It will probably be there tomorrow.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   Trust is key to our relationship.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.360]   Last Thursday night, Mary and I were having a conversation,
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.200]   and it was a tough one,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.380]   and we were trying to figure out what to do.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.600]   We're trying to understand what was going on.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.140]   And in the end, we came up with,
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.020]   "We're just gonna have to trust God in this."
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.100]   And that may be where you're at.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   And if you are there, I wanna give you a prophetic word
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.480]   straight from Jesus, where Jesus is looking at you
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   and he's saying, "You don't realize what I'm doing,
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.440]   "but trust me, you will.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.560]   "You will, you will realize."
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.720]   Peter did.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.000]   Peter got to a yes.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.240]   He got to a yes on the cross.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.640]   He went to his own cross.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.040]   He got to a yes with preaching the cross in Pentecost.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.540]   He got to a yes here.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.320]   He let Jesus wash his feet, and he preached about service
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.020]   and receiving and giving it.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.520]   Trust, that's the second.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.200]   No.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.040]   Now the third one.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.180]   We'll go on to the third no.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.400]   Still okay?
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.200]   Yeah, still working?
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.480]   Okay.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.160]   Let's keep praying for each other and praying for me
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.120]   as we hear what it is that the Holy Spirit is saying to us,
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.480]   because now I think we're getting
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.100]   a little more challenging, okay?
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.200]   'Cause now we've been at the level of,
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.000]   "Hmm, that's interesting.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.260]   "Jesus' best friend or one of his best friends
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.860]   "said no to him, and I've got a no, okay,
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.620]   "so it's probably gonna be okay.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.800]   "That's interesting.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.720]   "Hmm, those prayers might be useful."
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.560]   Not, "Hmm, ah, those prayers might be useful."
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.200]   But now we're down to the waterline,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.760]   and now we're down to what's really going on in our hearts.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.600]   We're going to the bulk of the matter.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.200]   Now in these two no's,
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.920]   there's been something they've had in common,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.920]   which is a little bit troubling to me.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.560]   We'll see that in the third no, very clearly.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.680]   And so let's go on to the third no
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.360]   and recognize that we are plunging below the water here.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.560]   Okay, so when we go to the third no, we're in Acts 10.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.440]   Now a lot has happened before this passage.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.680]   The last, the second no, was right before the crucifixion.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.160]   Then came the crucifixion.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.840]   Then came the resurrection, the lead up to Easter,
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.880]   which we're in right now, to Lent.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.520]   And then came the Pentecost,
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.160]   the glorious day of Pentecost,
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:12.720]   where the Holy Spirit fell,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.200]   and there was joy and there was a spreading out.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.920]   And then came persecution,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.600]   and there was more spreading out, but in a different way.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.480]   And then came Peter in a little town named Joppa.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.480]   And it says he was there and he kind of tarried there.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.160]   He waited there for a while.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.400]   And while he was waiting, this happened.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.120]   About noon the following day, as they were on their journey
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.640]   and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.280]   He became hungry and wanted something to eat.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.440]   And while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.200]   He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.080]   being let down to earth by its four corners.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.000]   It contained all kinds of four-footed animals,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.920]   as well as reptiles and birds.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   And then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat."
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.480]   "Surely not," Peter replied.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.320]   "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.520]   The voice spoke to him a second time.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.520]   "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.080]   This happened three times.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.400]   And immediately the sheet was taken back up to heaven.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.640]   Okay, Peter's back on form, right?
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.880]   Surely not, I've never done this.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.720]   What's the issue here?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.000]   What's the issue of this vision?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   This grand, great, vast vision of open doors and love.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.200]   The context is that at this time,
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.000]   Christianity is still part of Judaism.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.720]   It hasn't left Judaism.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.240]   It's part of Judaism, it's a sect within Judaism
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.520]   that believes that Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.800]   And in that context,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.480]   they're still following all the dietary laws,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.200]   all of this which basically went against the dietary laws
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.480]   of the Jews at the time.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.440]   And there's something even bigger happening,
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.400]   which we're about to find out.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.120]   Because this is not about food.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.040]   The vision is about people.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.000]   And we see that in the first line,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.080]   they were on their journey.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.120]   Now, who was the they?
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.360]   The they was a group of Gentiles
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.640]   coming from a Gentile named Cornelius.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.360]   Because at this time,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.120]   there were the Jews and there was everybody else, right?
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.680]   The Gentiles, most of us in this room I'm gathering.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.280]   And basically the word, the promise was for the Jews.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.160]   Now, there was a man named Cornelius, a great leader.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.400]   And he loved God and he was praying to God.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.160]   And he was praying to God over here,
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.880]   saying God, calling for God's favor.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.920]   And God told him,
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.840]   "Look, there's another guy over here named Peter."
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.000]   So he's also praying.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.360]   Now, here's what I found.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   When you have two people praying in two different camps,
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.160]   a bridge is about to be built, right?
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.520]   Because that's how bridge building works.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.880]   And if you're in a situation like that, pray.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.080]   And pray that someone on the other side is praying.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.160]   And then that bridge becomes together, right?
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.800]   Because here's the thing.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.440]   God is opening up the doors to the Gentiles.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.960]   He's opening it up to everyone.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.200]   He's opening up the vision, the good news, the life,
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.360]   flourishing, all of that to all of us.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.800]   And he's saying, "Here it is, Peter.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.240]   "It's for everyone."
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.880]   And Peter is saying, "No," three times.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.280]   This is the hardest no for Peter.
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.760]   So it's three times he has to be challenged.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.400]   But he does say yes.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.520]   He shifts to a yes.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.040]   He goes downstairs.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.280]   He goes downstairs and this they,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.640]   in that first line, has arrived now.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.560]   They say, "Will you come to our house?"
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.460]   That's also not allowed for Peter
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.160]   to go into a Gentile's house.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.360]   He says yes.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.560]   He goes with them.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.960]   He goes into the house.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.200]   They say, "Welcome."
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.360]   And he says, "You know I'm not supposed to be here."
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.080]   They said, "Yes, but thank you for coming."
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.300]   And then they begin to worship.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.720]   And the Holy Spirit falls in power.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.640]   And Peter is amazed.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.320]   And he says, "The Holy Spirit is for everyone.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.800]   "It's for all of us."
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.880]   And then in Acts 15, there's a big meeting
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.760]   of the church about this issue.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.840]   And there's two people there you may have heard of,
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.080]   Paul and Barnabas.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.280]   And they've come back from a mission.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.660]   They're saying, "The Gentiles are welcomed as well.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.920]   "Everyone is welcome."
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.760]   And there's a conference, right?
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.840]   There's a little controversy going on there.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.200]   And Peter stands up and puts his influence
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.440]   behind Paul and Barnabas and us,
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.260]   and says, "I've seen the Holy Spirit work in them."
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.360]   We can't call anything impure,
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.200]   which God has called clean.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.120]   That's the vision.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.040]   And that's an open vision.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.920]   And what does that say to us?
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.300]   Are there any that we have called impure,
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.500]   unclean, not quite fully in,
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.580]   that we should fully welcome?
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.100]   My mom used to say growing up,
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.820]   there's always room for one more at the table.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:48.220]   But it doesn't just invite people to worship.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.860]   It doesn't just invite people to the table to fellowship.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.180]   When you invite someone at the table,
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.560]   you give them a voice.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.940]   They can tell their story.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.660]   You share their story.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.400]   It becomes one.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.220]   That's the vision that Peter is struggling with.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.720]   And it's a vast vision.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.540]   Are there people of different lifestyles
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.700]   that we say, "You can come this far, but no further?"
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.220]   Are there people of different faiths
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.140]   we say, "You can come here, but not there?"
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.860]   Are there people we'll say, "We'll meet you here,
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.620]   "but you won't be in our home?
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.540]   "I won't go into your home?"
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:32.540]   Do you see the vision that Peter is working with?
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:38.060]   And thank God he got to yes, or we wouldn't be here.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.220]   Well, there'd be maybe another way,
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.520]   but it was the vision of yes.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.220]   And so that is the vision.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.140]   We're going much deeper now, right?
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.400]   And now we're coming to that area
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.020]   that I said I struggled with, with the three nos.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.100]   Because when I begin to really unpack this text,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.640]   and when I really begin to have the text,
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.140]   ask the text to work on me as I was working on it,
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.500]   then I found something in me that I didn't like.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.300]   And it might be something, and I think at some level,
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.920]   it's probably in all of us, and that is controlling.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.620]   We want to control things.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.220]   Particularly in uncertain times,
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.460]   we want as much control as we can get.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.480]   And so we kind of put that on God, right?
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.360]   We quote verses to God, or we tell God how to do things.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.160]   But when Peter said yes to the cross,
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.800]   he was saying, "Not my will, but your will be done."
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   And when he said yes to the towel,
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.520]   he's saying, "I don't really understand,
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.820]   "but I'm gonna trust you on this."
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.160]   And when he says yes to the vision,
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.440]   he's saying, "Whatever you want to do, do it."
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.020]   (silence)
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:51.780]   So let's go back to our iceberg.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.780]   Because on the iceberg, we've now gone below the waterline,
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.660]   and we're down here at the aha.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.660]   But what we've just said, if we really put into practice,
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.540]   it's gonna take courage.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.140]   And thankfully, Pastor Andrew preached on that last week.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.620]   It's also gonna take each other.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.900]   It's gonna take everyone in this room.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.780]   And thankfully, there's a fourth level to the iceberg.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.060]   And the fourth level is ahaha.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:30.180]   Just to add a little bit of joy on the journey as we go.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.780]   But so this is the ahaha.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.180]   Now the ahaha is, it's kind of hard to say that
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.120]   without smiling, so it's you and me.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.820]   It's not just an aha moment for you.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.580]   It's an aha moment for us.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:51.820]   And so as we come into this journey to Lent and Easter,
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.760]   as we come to get ready for the Vision Sunday as a church,
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.060]   it's basically saying, we want this ahaha, right?
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.100]   We wanna be open, fully opened.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.300]   So here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.780]   I'm gonna close with another simple prayer.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.700]   But this prayer, I'm gonna invite us to do more communally.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.500]   And because we need, we need each other.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.220]   We can't do this without the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.260]   We can't do this alone.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.360]   We still need courage as we go through it.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:28.320]   When I was in college, in university,
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.140]   then I was about the same age as actually 11
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.820]   of the students we work with.
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.940]   And so I was 19.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.080]   And as I was there in my second semester
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.180]   of my sophomore year, I went to a church on a Sunday night.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.420]   And I remember it's a small town in Texas, Waco,
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.620]   probably never heard of it.
[00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.740]   And a small town in Texas.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.220]   And I went to a church on a Sunday night.
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.000]   I remember it was raining.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.880]   I was obviously late because the pastor
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.700]   was already preaching when I came in.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.620]   And I sat in the back row and the pastor was preaching on,
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.140]   I've been crucified with Christ.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.420]   It's no longer I that live,
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.020]   but Christ that lives in me, from Galatians, from Paul.
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.860]   And he kept saying, what does that mean?
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.460]   What does that mean?
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.740]   And at the very end, he said, this is what it means.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.160]   And then he gave us this prayer.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:18.140]   And this prayer is a yes prayer.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:23.060]   This prayer says, whatever you want me to do, Lord,
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.900]   I will do it.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.060]   And so he said, so go home tonight and pray this.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:34.980]   So I did, with all the courage and risk of a 19 year old.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.080]   And then about four or five days later,
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.620]   I got a call from an organization saying that
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.920]   the person who's supposed to go to Haiti next semester
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.280]   can't go.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.060]   We saw that you had international experience.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.440]   Would you like to go?
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.320]   And it's hard to say no, right?
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.860]   You have to say yes.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:57.480]   That prayer has led us around the world for Marian and I.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.600]   It's led us to London.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.520]   It led us to Bonn.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.480]   It led us to Zurich.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.600]   It led us to Hong Kong 11 years ago.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.300]   It's led us right now to our current work, Marian's work,
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.440]   and then my work at the university.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   So I want to offer it to you as a guiding prayer,
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.680]   as a yes prayer, as a prayer that maybe
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.720]   we can pray all together.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.440]   So what I want to do now is do that with your permission.
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.220]   So let's just close in prayer.
[00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:25.440]   Felt led to do this
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.620]   starting in a time of silence.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.620]   I felt God was saying that one thing we could give each other
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:42.620]   is prayer, and so gave these prayers today.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.360]   But first of all, I want you just to be still.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.880]   Life is hectic.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.260]   Just be still.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:54.140]   Enjoy the stillness.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.680]   You're in a safe space.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:02.380]   And then to begin to orient your mind towards God.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:08.380]   And then to be attentive to what God might be saying.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:14.780]   Attention is one of the highest forms of love.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.380]   And then to receive.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:23.440]   And the first thing I would invite you to receive
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.440]   is the love of God.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:31.180]   Just to feel how deeply he loves you.
[00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.020]   He loves you.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:42.900]   And then in that context, just begin to talk to him.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.780]   Talk to Jesus as a friend.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:55.360]   Talk directly and listen.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.260]   And if the spirit is leading you, maybe pray this prayer.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:09.440]   If the spirit's not leading, just wait.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.000]   Maybe there'll be another time.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.920]   But to begin to pray.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.320]   If there's an area of no in your heart,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.440]   you identified it right away,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.800]   or maybe you identified it as we began to talk,
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   maybe go there and ask God how you should pray.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.220]   And trust him.
