1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Have a seat, have a seat.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Welcome to The Vine.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 If you're relatively new with us, my name's Andrew.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I'm one of the pastors here, and it's so great to have you here.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 I was just sensing as you were worshiping as well,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I wonder if anybody's just arrived in Hong Kong.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Maybe you're new to the city.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Maybe you've come in in the last week or two or month,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and you're settling into Hong Kong.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 It's totally new for you.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Maybe you have your family.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Maybe you're on your own.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Maybe work's brought you here, or for some reason you're in the city.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 If that's you, would you just put your hand up?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 You're new to Hong Kong.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 In the upper house, put your hand up if you're new.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 All right, awesome.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Here's what I want to do.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I want to just take a moment.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 If you're new to Hong Kong, I just want to say this.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 There's amazing great churches in our city, lots of great churches in our city.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 If you're new, we encourage you to get out there and experience

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 and to see some of the churches in our city.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 But every single church in here in Hong Kong would say the same thing.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 You are not in Hong Kong by mistake.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I'm biased because I've lived here for 40 years.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But God is doing something in this city I think that is unprecedented.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And you're a Christian, you're a believer, and you've been brought to this city.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And I believe the Lord is about to light a fire in you.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I believe that you came here for work, and work is awesome,

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 and there's lots going on in your work, and that's great.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But I believe that you're in this city for something far greater

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 than what you're doing Monday to Friday.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I believe that you're here because the Lord is actually bringing the sheep,

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 the community that he needs in his city for this time.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And so you bring gifts, you bring heart, you bring life,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 you bring experience that the church of Hong Kong desperately needs in this season.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 You are not here by mistake, amen?

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 So if you're new here, I want to do a brave thing.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Could you just stand if you're new to Hong Kong?

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You just put your hand up. I'd love you just to stand.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Could you stand with me? Come on. Upper house, lower house.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Come on, stand.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Yes!

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 All right.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Everybody else, everybody else,

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 could you just stretch out your hands towards these people?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Can we pray for them? Let's just pray.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Father, we want to pray right now. Lord, we welcome these guys to Hong Kong.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Hong Kong is not necessarily an easy place to fit into sometimes.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Lord, it's crazy. There are lots of things happening.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Crazy work hours. It's an expensive place to live.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Lord, we want to pray first of all for each of these people,

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 that they would just logistically, relationally, emotionally,

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 that they would adapt to Hong Kong,

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 that you would enable them to find their feet quickly.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So Lord, we thank you that you've sent them.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And Father, you have sent them to this city.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 These are the sent ones in this season.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And so Father, we recognize that they bring and they carry with them gifts,

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 an anointing and heart that Hong Kong needs,

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 that this church community needs, that our city needs.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And we want to pray now that you would release a fresh anointing over these ones.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Lord, you have brought them into this city, this fragrant harbor for this season.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And Lord, I want to pray that your spirit, Lord, would just enable them.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Where they're homesick, that you would meet them

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 and that you would speak life into them.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Lord, where they're beginning to get settled,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 that you would enable them to put roots down.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And Lord, I want to release a new season.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 I see oil being poured out upon you.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I want to pray that the oil of Jesus for this season,

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 the anointing that he has for you, would fall upon you

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 and that you would be able to work in the workplace, build relationships,

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 do the things that you do, get connected to community,

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 get connected to a church in a way that will flourish you and flourish Hong Kong.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 We are so glad that you are here.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Everyone says, "Amen."

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Welcome, everyone. Welcome.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 By the way, by the way, we don't do that every week.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 So that was special for you.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 I'm excited. I'm so grateful for Pastor Ellison

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and just this summer series that we've been in, the book of James.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And then for Phil and for Ellison that have taught and preached in this series so far to this point.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Phil brought a great message on that typhoon Sunday.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 He felt so bad for Phil that he couldn't be here to deliver it in person.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But a great message on the idea of pure religion.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 What does pure religion look like?

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And really that's the heart.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 That's the thesis for James throughout this whole letter is,

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 how do we understand what it is to be purified in the relationship that we have with our Father through Jesus?

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And so that was week one.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Week two, Ellison brought a powerful word around faith and deeds last week.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And what does it mean to wrestle with the idea that we don't just profess a belief,

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 but that actually changes and impacts the way in which we live.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 And I want to kind of build on that a little bit as we move into the third chapter of James here this morning.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And we look at a topic that I think is very central to James' heart for the people that he's writing to.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Remember, he's writing to a community of people that are facing persecution,

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 facing hostility for their faith and their environment, facing division amongst themselves,

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 trying to settle in to what it means to be community together.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And in the third chapter, the heart of his letter, in chapters one and two, James has been pretty direct.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 It's almost been like he's been a little bit strong.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 He's been like a little bit of a tell you off for all the things.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 But by the time he gets to chapter three, this pastoral heart for James comes out.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And when I read James and I get into the flow of his arguments and then I come into chapter three,

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 it almost sounds like James is like kind of just hushing down a little bit.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Like he's wanting his community just to take a moment, to take a breath.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And he starts, we'll see this in a moment, but he starts a chapter and he says,

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 "I want to talk to you now about something that we all struggle with."

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's like this beautiful pastoral moment.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He's kind of like slapped them around a bit, chapters one and two.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 But in the third chapter, he's like, "I want to just express my heart for you guys."

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 He says, "I struggle with this. You struggle. We all struggle with this thing."

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And in the chapter, he speaks about the power of words.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 He speaks about what comes out of our mouths.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He speaks about the way in which we use our tongue, our language, and our words.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And I think it's important to James because I think James sees the much bigger picture.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 I think he sees the reality of what God has done in creating human beings to be able to communicate.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I don't know if you've thought about it this way, but our words and our language and our communication,

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 it's the secret ingredients that aligns ourselves to either be able to draw closer to one another

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 or actually to push each other apart.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I don't know if you've thought about it that way, but essentially your words,

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 your ability to communicate is the process by which you as a human being can do the one thing

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 that every human being desires for the most, and that is intimacy.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 We are literally created for relationship, created for intimacy.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And it is our communication, the way in which we speak, that brings that into our lives.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So in those seasons where we speak well and we speak life and we offer words of encouragement and love

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 and we connect well with people, we draw close and we are more intimate with the people around us.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 But likewise, in those moments of life where we argue, where we slander, we gossip,

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 we find like stuff's not going down well and we communicate in ways that are rough or harsh,

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 we find ourselves at enmity with the people around us, pushing away from the people around us.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The actual word communication has an etymology that just basically means the roots within it.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And communication, the etymology of that is community.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And the etymology of community is communion.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Communion, this idea of drawing close and being intimate,

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 we just shared in what we call within the church world the communion table,

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 the place through the bread and the cup where we join in deeper relationship and intimacy

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 with the forgiveness of Christ and the power of His resurrection.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So communion forms out of community which is created by our communication.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 So if we want greater communion with God and with one another, our communication is important.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 When that goes wrong, community breaks.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And when community breaks, it is a struggle to find communion.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 So when you think about the reality that God has literally created you for communion, for intimacy,

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 then your communication is central.

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 In other words, words really matter.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Like they really matter.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Not just because God wants you to be a nice person.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 In fact, when you look at this chapter that we're going to unpack together today,

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 the temptation is to think really what James is just saying is, you know, change your behavior a little bit.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Like just try to say some nicer things.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 But that's not at all what James is interested in.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 He's not interested in some sort of behavior modification.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 What James is interested in is helping all of us to understand the breadth and the beauty

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 of what God has done in this world and how that impacts us and our words that we speak

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 either align ourselves to the beauty and the wonder of God's kingdom or they dramatically take us away.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And you can sense this pastoral heart of James leaning out to his church, quietening his voice

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 and saying, "We're in this together, but I wonder whether we could together come truly, fully alive."

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 So what I want to do with you here this morning is take you on a bit of that journey through what James is teaching.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 My prayer is that each one of us by the end would feel like there is a way for us to become more alive,

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 more the way that he has created us to be.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And to recognize that it's not about trying to say some nicer things,

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 but it's about understanding that the way in which we've been created to be

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 means that the words out of my mouth can bring life.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 So let me show you this from James chapter 3. We're going to start in verse 2.

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 He actually speaks about words in three of his chapters because that's how important it is to him.

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But let me just start chapter 3, verse 2. This is this. He says, "We all stumble in many ways."

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Isn't that a beautiful pastoral way to start? Like he's not starting like,

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 "I've got three things I want to beat you around the head on today."

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 He starts by saying, "I'm in this boat with you. We're in this boat together.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 We all stumble in so many ways."

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 He says, "If any person is never at fault in what they say,

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 they are a perfect person able to keep their whole body in check."

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 He's like, "Man, if you could get yourself, if you could be perfect in this, this is an amazing thing.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 But here's the thing we all stumble with."

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 See, when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and driven by strong winds,

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 they are steered by a very small rudder whichever way the pilot wants it to go.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Likewise, the tongue. It is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Consider what a great forest is set on fire by such a small spark.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 The tongue also is a fire, a weld of evil among the parts of the body.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It disrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of their life on fire,

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and is itself set on fire by hell.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by people,

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 but no person can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil full of deadly poison.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And he says this, this is what we do.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 "With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who have been made in God's likeness.

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this should not be.

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives? Can a grapevine bear figs?

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water."

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It's really beautiful here what James is trying to lean into his church.

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 He's like, "Don't you understand that there's this reality that we all stumble with,

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and we all struggle with these words?" And he gives us three pictures to help us to see this.

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 He talks about the bit that's placed in a horse's mouth.

197
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 He talks about a rudder that's on a ship and how it steers.

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 But the one I want to dig into a little bit is the third image he gives us,

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 and it's of a spark that brings a fire to a whole forest.

200
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And he talks about how this tongue is like a fire that is set on fire.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And then he goes all the way to the end of that passage, and he says,

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 "It's like it's burning, like the burning of hell."

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And he uses this word that we translate into the English as hell.

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And when we, in our time, read that word, we immediately think of the opposite of heaven.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 We think that James is literally saying that the tongue can bring us into a place of hell,

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 as in this like eternal damnation away from heaven.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 But actually, James is not using the word hell here. That's the word we translate.

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 He's actually naming a place that the Greek word here is the word Gehenna.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And Gehenna became the theme of which the New Testament begins to speak of the idea of hell.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 But in this moment, James is speaking about a place.

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 He's naming a place that the people he's writing to would know about quite well.

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Gehenna was about 50 miles south-southwest of Jerusalem.

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And throughout the whole history of Israel in their land, it was a significant place.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 In the Old Testament times, there were tribes that lived in the area of Gehenna.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Gehenna, interestingly, was a forest.

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So notice in this part, he says, "A small spark that sets fire to a whole forest."

217
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Gehenna was a forest area.

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Now, what happened in the Old Testament times is that the tribes that lived there worshipped a god called Malak.

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 And Malak, the way they worshipped him, and this is horrible, trigger warning, but the reality,

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 they worshipped him through the sacrifice of children.

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And the way they would do that is they would build a fire, a bonfire,

222
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 and then the child that was to be sacrificed was placed on the bonfire and was literally burned to death.

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 This was the worship to this Malak that was happening in that place.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Now, by the time James is writing, Gehenna has long stopped that practice.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 But because of that, that land was always seen as cursed.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 It was a place of great fire before where the worst of humanity took place.

227
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 The evils. If you could think about it, what's the worst thing that humanity could do?

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Somebody taking their child and burning them in this fire.

229
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Well, this is what Gehenna represented.

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Now, in James' time, they're not doing that anymore, but here's what happened.

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 All of the rubbish, all of the stuff from Jerusalem that was rubbish, was sent down to Gehenna and was burnt there.

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 So fires within this forest were still happening, and the stench of that on the wrong day,

233
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 of the windmills blowing the wrong way, could still reach into Jerusalem.

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 It was a place that represented the stench of the worst of humanity. Does that make sense?

235
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Now, follow James' argument here.

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 He's talking about the tongue, and he's comparing the tongue in the mouth

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 to the horrors of the reality of what happened in the past in Gehenna.

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And he says, literally like this, "You've got to understand that this is what the tongue can do.

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It can create a reality in which the worst of human choices become true."

240
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Are you following?

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 This is the seriousness of what James is trying to talk to the church about.

242
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Your tongue can, if not controlled, be like Gehenna.

243
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 It can actually create a situation where the worst of human choices become a reality.

244
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So for James, right up front, our tongue, what we speak, and the reality of something created come together.

245
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Are you following this?

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Now, it's important that you see this link, because ultimately what James is trying to do

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 is kind of bring the church to a much bigger picture of what's happening in Scripture

248
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 around this idea of speaking and creating.

249
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 In fact, in verse 11, he speaks about the source.

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 He says, "Can fresh water and salt water come together and be in the same thing?

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Can you have two sources creating two different things?"

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 He's like, "No, no, no, no. There's only one source."

253
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 So to understand really what James is trying to teach about this fact that our tongue can create realities

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 that would express the worst of what humanity can do, you have to take him all the way back to the source.

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 And I want to show you some things here from the source of our words.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And of course, to do that, you have to go all the way back to the right to the beginning of the biblical story.

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Let me read you just the first three verses of Genesis.

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Genesis 1, verses 1 to 3.

259
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep,

261
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters."

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Verse 3, "And God said, 'Let there be light.' And there was light."

263
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 This is one of the most wonderful moments.

264
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I wonder if you've ever asked yourself, "Why does God use words to create?"

265
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Why does it specifically say here that God said He spoke, the Hebrew word here meaning literally out loud,

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He spoke out loud, "Let there be light."

267
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And there was light.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Think about this.

269
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 There was no one around right now in creation to hear it.

270
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Come on, church.

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Like no one had been created yet.

272
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 There were no animals, no things, no people.

273
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 That all comes later.

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 No one is there to hear it.

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 So why didn't He think creation into being?

276
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Like what was the point?

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 What was the purpose of Him speaking?

278
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 God is trying to show us that there is a reality through the way in which He's created the words.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And so He stands over creation, and He speaks to this formless void, and He brings it into creation.

280
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 The Hebrew word that is found in the Old Testament that we translate to word in English is "deba."

281
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And "deba" literally in the Hebrew can mean a word or it can mean a thing.

282
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And those two things seem quite different.

283
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Like is it a word or is it a thing, like a real thing?

284
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Well, the reason why it can mean both is because in the Hebrew concept of the idea of a word, words have material reality to them.

285
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 This is different for us and how we think about it these days.

286
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Because when we think about words, we just think about things that are spoken out of somebody's mouth or something written on a page.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 The Hebrews didn't think of it that way.

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Because God created with His word, the way they saw it is that God "debarred" creation.

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Words, in other words, have material reality to them.

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 They can literally create something.

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And this idea of the Hebrew concept of "deba" is found throughout our scriptures.

292
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Have you ever heard someone say, "Man, when they talked, their words had weight."

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 That's the Hebrew idea of the concept of "deba."

294
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 When I was 15 years old, I decided to try out for the local play that was happening in my school.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I'd never done any drama before.

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I'd never thought about doing drama, but I needed to get a few extra things on my resume.

297
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 So I decided I was going to be in the drama.

298
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 So I went along for the audition.

299
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 The drama teacher, who was like, "Why are you here?"

300
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And I'm like, "Hi."

301
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And he's like, "Okay, well here's what you need to do."

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And he said, "I'm going to put a mirror on the front of the stage.

303
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And then you're going to get up, and I want you to mime for five minutes the mirror and your interaction with the mirror."

304
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So I was like, "Okay."

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 So I got up on stage, and there was the mirror.

306
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And I went up, and I started interacting with the mirror, and I did all these things.

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And I tried my best. It probably wasn't the greatest thing that had ever happened.

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But as I put down the mirror at the end of the five minutes, I just stood there, and he didn't say anything.

309
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 He just sort of stared at me for a while.

310
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And I was a little bit worried to begin with.

311
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 He was like just staring me down.

312
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And then he said these words.

313
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 He said, "What you just did made me come alive."

314
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 I wonder if you can imagine for a 15-year-old kid, for somebody who's in authority, to say something like that over them.

315
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And I remember in that moment thinking to myself, "That's what I want to do for the rest of my life."

316
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Not drama, because I'm not great at drama, but I want to help people come alive.

317
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 That man didn't know it, but he dabbared on me in that moment.

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 A word out of his mouth gave this 15-year-old a calling for the rest of his life.

319
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And ever since that day, I have been dedicating my life to helping people come alive.

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 This is the Hebrew concept of dabbar.

321
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Our words have weight and material reality to them.

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Now notice what happens next as God creates humanity.

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Then God said, "Let us make humanity in our image, in our likeness.

324
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Let them rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, over all the ground, and the creatures among them on the ground."

325
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 So God created humanity in his own image.

326
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 In the image of God, he created him.

327
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Male and female, he created them.

328
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Notice, "God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number. Fill the earth and subdue it.'"

329
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 And then as we get down to verse 31, it says, "God saw all that he had made by speaking, and it was very good."

330
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I want you to see something really important here, because in God's creation of humanity,

331
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 God shows us the process by which his words are created, by which he dabbars in this world.

332
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Notice, God speaks, he creates, he then blesses, and then finally he pronounces good.

333
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 And you'll see that rhythm throughout all seven days of creation,

334
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 but it's right there at the moment when God creates humanity.

335
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 He speaks, he creates, he blesses, and he pronounces good.

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Now, here's what happens next.

337
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 God has created humanity, and he says these words.

338
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 He says, "You are my image on earth,"

339
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 which means a lot of different things, but in this case, it means that you are able also to image, to be, and partner with me.

340
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Remember, he says to humanity, "Go into the world, bring it to flourishing,

341
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 help the world to grow and to flourish, subdue it and bring it to life."

342
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So here's humanity doing that.

343
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Now, guess what happens first?

344
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Here's the first way God shows Adam and Eve to do that.

345
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 He takes Adam, and he says to Adam, "I want you to name the animals."

346
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Have you ever wondered why God asked Adam to name the animals?

347
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It's because God is saying, "The first thing I want humanity to do is debar."

348
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Are you following this?

349
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 "I want you to speak the name," name in the Hebrew being character,

350
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 "I want you to describe, I want you to tell the animals who they are."

351
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 That's essentially what he's asking Adam to do.

352
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 "Tell the animals who they are."

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 So there's Adam, and this weird creature comes before him,

354
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 and he looks at the creature, and he sees the tail, and he sees the big mane of hair,

355
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 and he goes, "Lion."

356
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Are you with me?

357
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Notice, Adam does not think lion.

358
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Adam speaks the word.

359
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 He names the animal.

360
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Lion, giraffe, alligator, whatever it was, whatever came before him,

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 whatever the Lord brought to him, he spoke out.

362
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And in speaking out, he debarred on that animal, its character, its nature, its identity, what it is.

363
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 He gave it its name.

364
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 God is creating a structure where he creates, he speaks, he creates, he blesses,

365
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and everything is declared good.

366
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 We then get to speak.

367
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 We get to create.

368
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 We get to bless.

369
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 And we get to bring the world into a flourishing that is very good.

370
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Are you following this?

371
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But then, thousands of years later, James writes to the church, and he says, "It's all hell."

372
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Like it's all burning.

373
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Like what's coming out of our mouths is setting everything on fire, and not in a good way.

374
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So the question we should have is, "What happened?"

375
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Because if it was created to be a certain way, and then James is saying, "It's not like that anymore.

376
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 What in the world happened?"

377
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Well, notice what it says in Genesis 3, starting in verse 1.

378
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Is this helpful so far?

379
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I'll get back to James in a moment, trust me.

380
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But we flow together through what the Scriptures are saying.

381
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Notice what it says in Genesis 3, verse 1.

382
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 "Now the serpent," the snake, this is representative, this is enemy, this was Satan.

383
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 "Now Satan was more crafty than any of the wild animals that the Lord had made.

384
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 He said to the woman Eve," he said,

385
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "Did God really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden?"

386
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 I want you to see something very important that happens here that, again, we often miss over.

387
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 First of all, Satan, as he's thinking about, "How do I convince humanity to be changed?"

388
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 He doesn't try to convince their thoughts.

389
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 He doesn't try to influence their emotions.

390
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Here's how Satan does it.

391
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 He speaks.

392
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 So he speaks over Eve.

393
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 "The snake in the tree opens its mouth and speaks words."

394
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And he says this.

395
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Notice what he says.

396
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 "Did God really say?"

397
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 So the first thing that the enemy does is try to attack the structure of God speaking,

398
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 God creating, God blessing, God bringing good.

399
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 "Did God really say all of this stuff?"

400
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And suddenly, here's Eve and Adam, and they're beginning to get confused.

401
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 They're beginning to go, "Hang on a sec, now, what do we believe?"

402
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Because there's a new voice in the world.

403
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Are you seeing this?

404
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 There's a new debar that is taking place.

405
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Satan is speaking and trying to now get Adam and Eve to believe and to think in a different way.

406
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And now Adam and Eve are caught between these two narratives that are at play.

407
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Will they align themselves to the wonder of the Lord and the debar of Him,

408
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 or will they now align themselves to the trickery and the destruction of the enemy?

409
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And here's what they do.

410
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 In choosing the fruit from that tree, in deciding to take on that,

411
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 and to believe and adhere to Satan,

412
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 they change from adhering to one way of being and speaking to now aligning with another.

413
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And here's what Satan does.

414
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Satan speaks, Satan destroys, Satan curses, Satan pronounces death.

415
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 So see these two things side by side right here.

416
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And all of this is sort of saying, all of this is driven by what comes out of the mouth.

417
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And here's the thing, which of these two are we going to align our lives with?

418
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 This is why for James, this is not about some behavior modification.

419
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 It's not like, "Hey, just try to be a nicer person in the world."

420
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Like this is James saying, "Don't you understand what you've been created for,

421
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 how the world is structured, and you are either one of these things or you're the other."

422
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 This is very important.

423
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 James is essentially saying to the church, "There are no neutral words."

424
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Come on, church.

425
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Your words out of your mouth, they're either aligning yourself to what God is doing

426
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 and brings blessing and life, or your words are aligning to the work of the enemy,

427
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 and you're bringing death and destruction.

428
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 There's no middle ground.

429
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 There's no Genesis 3b.

430
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 It's Genesis 1, 2, and 3, and then we're on a journey for redemption through Jesus Christ.

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 There's a red pill and a blue pill.

432
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 There's no other pill.

433
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 That's a matrix reference for any of you who are my age.

434
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 There's no neutral words James wants his church to know.

435
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 You're either this or you're that, and this, he says, is the issue.

436
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And notice what he says at the start.

437
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 "We all struggle with this."

438
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 So the question is, how do we align more to that side than that side?

439
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Well, when the disciple John is sitting down to write his version of the gospel,

440
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 and he thinks, "How do I start to help people to understand who Jesus is?"

441
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Notice the words he says, John 1, verse 3.

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 "In the beginning was the word."

443
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 There it is. Isn't that interesting?

444
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 So in the beginning, he's saying, "was the deba."

445
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Now the word he's using here, it's not the Hebrew word, of course, because he's writing in Greek.

446
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 This is the word logos, but it links to that deba idea in the Hebrew.

447
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 "And the word was with God, and the word was God, and he was with God in the beginning.

448
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Through him all things were made. Without him nothing was made that has been made."

449
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 And then if you jump down to verse 14, it says, "The word became flesh and made its dwelling amongst us."

450
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 So there's this beautiful thing.

451
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Here's John trying to describe Jesus.

452
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 He's like, "You've got to understand that Jesus is the culmination of what every deba of God looks like."

453
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Like if you were to take a human being,

454
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 one who was able to live every word and promise of God,

455
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 and everything that came out of his mouth was a blessing and not a curse,

456
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 it would be Jesus.

457
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 He is the word of God.

458
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 The fullness of creation is within him.

459
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 He was the one who was there, speaking at the beginning, creating it all in the first place.

460
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And literally, John will go on to say this,

461
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 "Through his death, life, and resurrection, you yourself can become a new creation.

462
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 You yourself can be made new."

463
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 There is great hope in that, but you have to understand the starting point.

464
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 You want to understand who Jesus is? He's the deba of God.

465
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 God's word made flesh.

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 That's deba, materiality.

467
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 God speaks. Jesus is.

468
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And in the fullness of that, it's quite interesting, because I love this phrase,

469
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 "And the word became flesh."

470
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Now, follow with this.

471
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 There's only ever one time where the fullness of the word of God became flesh, and that's Jesus.

472
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 But I think words become flesh all the time.

473
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I bet every single person in here can probably testify to a moment where someone said something over you,

474
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 spoke a word to you, maybe in a season in your life in the past,

475
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 maybe when you were young as a child, maybe it's even somebody in the office recently.

476
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Someone said something to you, and it's deeply disrupted you, and it's deeply hurt,

477
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 and that word begins to take on flesh, and that flesh becomes you.

478
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Maybe someone said to you, "You're not good enough. You're not good enough."

479
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Maybe your parents said that to you when you were a kid,

480
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 or maybe a trusted authority figure, teacher, or a pastor, or a mentor said those words over you.

481
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And here's what happened when they said those words to you.

482
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 You began to internalize the reality that nothing you could do could ever be good enough,

483
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 that no matter how many grades, how much effort, your parents never seemed to be satisfied,

484
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 never seemed to be pleased with you, and you kind of found yourself thinking,

485
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 "Well, I'm never going to be good enough at all."

486
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And because that's been internalized, years later, you're still living a life

487
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 that when you're in relationships with the people around you,

488
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 you're not expecting that relationship to go well.

489
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 You're not expecting them to accept you, love you, embrace you,

490
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 because you are thinking, "I'm never going to be enough for my wife, for my husband,

491
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 for my boss, for my colleague, for my friends at church. I'm never enough."

492
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 And the word that was spoken has become flesh, and that flesh is now you.

493
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Are you with me?

494
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Or maybe somebody said over you, "You're never going to amount to anything."

495
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 And they immediately cast your future into doubt.

496
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 So then every time a job comes up, and you're like, "Man, should I apply for that?"

497
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 You're thinking, "Hang on a sec. I'm never going to amount to anything."

498
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And you're suddenly feeling imposter syndrome.

499
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 "Oh, this is not for me. Somebody else is better at this than I am."

500
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And it's stopping you from actually taking the risk to step into the one thing that God has created you for,

501
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 but you're staying away from it, because somebody at some point told you,

502
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 "You're never going to amount to anything."

503
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And now you feel like an imposter all the time, no matter what it is that you try to do.

504
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 The word became flesh, and that flesh became you.

505
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 The reality is we do this to one another, don't we?

506
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 We speak slander and gossip and harsh words.

507
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 We use our tongue in such destructive ways.

508
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 We've been hurt, and here's the reality. Hurt people hurt people.

509
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And because we've been hurt, and because somebody said that to us,

510
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 we've found ourselves saying that to somebody else.

511
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 And it seems that there's this cycle going on, and James writes to the church,

512
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 and he says, "It's like the fire of Gehenna is coming out of our mouths."

513
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 When we were created for communion and intimacy, we're just destroying everything.

514
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Have a look at some of these other words that get spoken over us.

515
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Perhaps some of these resonate with you and your journey.

516
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 And then James, in the moment of all of this, he says perhaps the strongest thing he says in this part.

517
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Verse 9 and 12, he says, "With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father,

518
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 and then with it we curse people who have been made in God's likeness.

519
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Out of the same mouth comes praise and cursing.

520
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 My brothers and sisters, this should not be.

521
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?

522
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives?

523
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 A grapevine bear figs?

524
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And can salt spring produce fresh water?"

525
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 James says, "Look, we have to understand.

526
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 We can see the power of the destructive words of the enemy,

527
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 and we all have felt and experienced those words spoken over us."

528
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 But James is like, "Here's the reality. We all struggle with this.

529
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 We do both ourselves.

530
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 We come in, and we worship Him, and we praise Him, and we lift our hands up,

531
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 and we say, 'Oh, yes, Lord. Everything I am submitted to You.'"

532
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And then on Monday, we start to slander and gossip and speak down,

533
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 and we start to criticize and judge, and then we come back on Sunday,

534
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 and we praise Jesus again.

535
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And James is saying, "Hang on a second.

536
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 Can't you realize that that God process that leads to goodness

537
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 and that satanic evil process that leads to death,

538
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 don't you realize that both of these are coming out of your mouth?"

539
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 And that's why he then challenges the church, and he says,

540
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 "We all struggle with this, so the thing we have to do is check the source."

541
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Because he says, "Can fresh and salt come out of the same source?"

542
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 They cannot. So the issue here is not behavior modification.

543
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 How do I say nice to things? The issue here, what is going on in my heart?

544
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Because what's in here is obviously impacting what's coming out of here.

545
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Jesus, in Luke 6, verse 45, He says,

546
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 "Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks."

547
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 So when James is saying, "We have to get back to the source,"

548
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 he's basically saying, "Look at your heart," but remember, he's doing it pastorally.

549
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 He's like, "Look at your heart.

550
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 What is going inside of your heart that's causing stuff to be happening?"

551
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 And it's almost like he's saying, "Look, we've got to invite the Holy Spirit

552
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 to constantly be examining our heart, because if it's true

553
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 that our words can bring life or death in us or through us,

554
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 then we have to constantly invite the Holy Spirit to be in our hearts,

555
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 because the health of my heart will determine the grace of my words."

556
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 You following? The health of my heart will determine the grace of my words.

557
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 So the question I should be asking myself is,

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 "What's really going on in my heart?"

559
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I want to say two things predominantly go on in our hearts

560
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 that cause our words to align more with the evil side than with God's side.

561
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Sin and hurt.

562
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And those two things are constantly grappling in our heart.

563
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Sin is such a reality for us all.

564
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Jesus was one that lived a certain life that shows us a different way.

565
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 1 Peter 2.22, Peter writes this beautiful thing.

566
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Let me read this to you in 1 Peter 2.22.

567
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 He says, speaking of Jesus, "He committed no sin, so no deceit was found in him."

568
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Isn't that beautiful? "No deceit was found in his mouth," Peter said,

569
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 because he committed no sin.

570
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 So Peter makes this connection between the heart and the mouth.

571
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 He makes the connection with Jesus and says he's the only one.

572
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Remember James at the beginning of the passage,

573
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 "If you were a perfect person, and good things always came out of your mouth,

574
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 but none of us are perfect."

575
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 So James is like, "None of us are Jesus."

576
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 So we all struggle with this, but here's the reality.

577
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Sin is one of the reasons why we struggle with this,

578
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 because Jesus had no sin, therefore there was no deceit,

579
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 no slander, no gossip, no malice, no brokenness coming out of his mouth.

580
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 When we deal with sin in the source, we begin to find our language change.

581
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 But the reality is so many of us try to change the language and ignore the heart.

582
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Come on, church.

583
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 We try to change what we're saying,

584
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 thinking that that's the thing that James is calling us to.

585
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 James is like, "I'm not asking you to change what you say.

586
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 I'm asking you to change your heart, and when you change your heart,

587
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 look at what you're about to say."

588
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Some of you here, you're spending a lot of time trying to get better at what you say

589
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 without spending any time asking the question,

590
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 "Why am I saying the things that I'm saying in the first place?"

591
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 That's the heart.

592
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 Like, "What really is going on in my heart?"

593
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 And so during worship, God's convicting me,

594
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 "Andrew, your anchor's too short."

595
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 A lot of you have submitted to me, but there's still bits of you that are not submitted to me.

596
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 You need to deal with that stuff.

597
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 The health of my heart will determine the grace of my words.

598
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 It'll be the same for you too.

599
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 I don't know about you, but I want to align to the right side.

600
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 So that means I need to deal with the sin.

601
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 God's given us this grace of forgiveness and repentance.

602
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 He's given us the ability to let go of the things that darken our hearts.

603
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And I want to encourage you, if you're finding yourself aligning more with that evil side,

604
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 even though you know you don't want to, but you find yourself doing it,

605
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 the way you speak to your spouse, the way you speak to your children,

606
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 the way you speak to your colleagues, you know it's not right.

607
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 The question I think the Lord would ask you to is,

608
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 "Just check your heart. What's going on?

609
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Is there some stuff there that may need to be brought to Him

610
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 in repentance and His grace to forgive you?"

611
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 So that's sin.

612
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Let me finish on hurt.

613
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Because I said earlier, hurting people hurt people.

614
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 And while sin is one of the things that causes the bad stuff to come out of our mouths,

615
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 hurt perhaps even more causes us to not be the people that we were created to be.

616
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Some of you here have been deeply hurt.

617
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 Deeply hurt by words spoken of you.

618
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Some of it, it's generational.

619
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Something was spoken over you as a child, and now that you're a parent,

620
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 you're finding yourself speaking the same thing over your child.

621
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 And you know that that's not right, and you feel the shame of it.

622
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 But the reality is you haven't been able to break that cycle.

623
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Many of us here probably have struggled with the reality that we've been hurt by something somebody said,

624
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 and it's become flesh, and that flesh is now us,

625
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 and it's the way we think about ourselves now.

626
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 And I want you to know that there are two things that will set you free from hurt

627
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 when you think about it in terms of words.

628
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 And if you're feeling that here, these two things are the most important for you in this message.

629
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Here's the first thing.

630
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 We need to re-hear the word that God says to us

631
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 so that we're not hearing the word that the enemy says.

632
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 Remember, the enemy comes to Adam and Eve and tries to get them to doubt God's word.

633
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 When we're walking in hurt and finding hurt coming out of our mouths,

634
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 it's because we're doubting the way that we were truly created to be.

635
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 We need to realign the ears of our hearts to hear again what God says to us.

636
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 We need to allow him to debar through the scriptures, through our worship,

637
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 through our community together.

638
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 We need to hear the voice of God say the opposite thing from what the voice of the enemy said.

639
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 So when somebody said to me before that I am not good enough,

640
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 I hear from Jesus, "You are my son and my daughter whom I love, and with you I am well pleased."

641
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 When the enemy has said, "You are never going to amount to anything,"

642
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 I'm hearing from the Lord, "I have put the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead in you,

643
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 and I've put my passion and my mission in you, and I am setting you free."

644
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 When somebody has told me, "You're ugly," I'm hearing from the Lord,

645
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 "I have fearfully and wonderfully made you, and you are unique.

646
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 There is no one in all of creation that carries the image of God just like you."

647
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Where the enemy has said that I am a person of shame,

648
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 I hear from Jesus, "You are the righteousness of Christ."

649
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Come on, church.

650
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 So we have to hear what the Lord is saying to us,

651
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 and believe His word over the words that have been spoken,

652
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 either by people with bad intention, or even by people with good intention,

653
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 that still hurt us. Are you with me?

654
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 But there's a second piece, and I think this piece is actually even more important.

655
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 You see, I think it's not just about hearing what God says to us.

656
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 It's not just about hearing what's in His mouth directed towards us.

657
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 It's also now also about what is in our mouths about us.

658
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 You see, if the issue is this hurt that I'm carrying in my spirit,

659
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 and if that hurt has made flesh in me,

660
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 and I've begun to think of my identity based around that thing,

661
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 then here's the thing. The way that I break that reality of that identity,

662
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 yes, it's hearing what God says to me,

663
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 but it's also now prophetically declaring with my own tongue

664
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 that I am not what that word said that I was.

665
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 That I now also can take a stand like Adam standing before the animals

666
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 and saying lion and alligator and giraffe.

667
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 I get to stand before myself and say, "I'm a son of God."

668
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Like I want to hear God say it, but I need to confess it with my tongue.

669
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 I need to speak out with my mouth because that's going to change something within me.

670
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 So I declare lion. I declare son of God.

671
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 I declare righteousness of Christ.

672
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 I declare that the same spirit in me is the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead.

673
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 And I say it. It's my confession.

674
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 And I create worlds as I speak out with my tongue.

675
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Not just the power of positive thinking.

676
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 I'm not saying, "Be a better person, Andrew."

677
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 I'm declaring God's word through my word.

678
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Are you with me?

679
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 This is not some kind of hippie thing that we're talking about.

680
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 This is like I'm taking the promises of God that I'm hearing,

681
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 but then I'm not just hearing them. I'm actually declaring them.

682
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 I'm not just receiving them. I'm speaking them.

683
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 I'm not just finding them in my life.

684
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 I'm speaking them into my life, into the people around me.

685
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 I'm a mouthpiece of the word, the debar of God.

686
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And in that debarring myself, something profound in the healing of my heart takes place.

687
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 I break the bond.

688
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 Remember in Matthew 18. I love this.

689
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 I'm not going long. Stay with me for a second.

690
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 This is okay? I'm very excited right now.

691
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 I'm sweating like a pig.

692
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 You know in Matthew 18 when Jesus says,

693
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 He says, "What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven.

694
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."

695
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 What He's saying is, "If you put your life in my hands, I will put my kingdom in your mouth."

696
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 So what you say will have an impact.

697
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 What you do will have an impact like Ellison was talking about last week.

698
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 So we align ourselves to the God who speaks, creates, blesses, and is good.

699
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 And in doing that with our own tongue and mouth, we bind and we loose.

700
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 So what was bound in me by those people who spoke over me,

701
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 I now loose through the word of God in my life.

702
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 This is why Isaiah, when he's standing there in Isaiah chapter 6,

703
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 and God calls, "Hey, who am I going to send?"

704
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 And Isaiah goes, "Me."

705
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 What does God do?

706
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 The first thing God does, takes a coal.

707
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 And what does He do?

708
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 Touches his mind?

709
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Nope.

710
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Touches his heart?

711
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Nope.

712
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Touches his mouth.

713
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 He's like, "You're going to go and be my mouthpiece."

714
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 What does the New Testament say about you?

715
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 You are a sent one.

716
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 So we go now with the need for the anointing of our mouths to be able to declare,

717
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 not just hear the words of God, but to declare, to speak the words of God,

718
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 to break the bonds that have happened in our hearts, and to truly come alive.

719
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 "Oh, struggle with this," says James.

720
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 But there is freedom.

721
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 Amen?

722
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 Amen.

723
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 Would you stand with me?

724
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 I would love to pray for you.

725
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 And here's how we're going to pray.

726
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 On the screen, I'm going to put up a whole bunch of things that are declarations

727
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 that I've designed, and your issue may not be on there,

728
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 but this is a catalyst, maybe, to thinking about what the declaration might be

729
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 for the hurt or the need or the brokenness or the sin that is in you.

730
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 But you're in this room, and anxiety has been a thing for you,

731
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
 and you've defined yourself that way, and you're often saying,

732
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 "I'm an anxious person. I'm this."

733
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 Your declaration might be, "I'm not a slave to fear."

734
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Or maybe your declaration is, "I am good enough, and I've had people tell me other things,

735
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 but here's what I declare. I know God sees that in me,

736
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 and here's my declaration. I am good enough. His grace is sufficient.

737
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 I have been forgiven. He will always be with me. I have a sound mind.

738
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 Everybody around me tells me that I'm going crazy. I've got a sound mind."

739
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 So as we begin to declare the promises of God with our own tongue,

740
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
 we set ourselves free.

741
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 So here's what I want you to do.

742
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 I'm not going to have you do this crazy out loud, and that would be weird,

743
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 but I just want you to take a moment to look on the screen and say,

744
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 "You know what? I'm aligning to one of these."

745
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 And again, maybe yours is not on the screen, but you know what it is.

746
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 And you're saying, "That's my declaration this week.

747
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 That's the thing that needs to be on my tongue this week.

748
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 That's what I need to say to my spirit. That's what I need to say to my family.

749
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 That's what I need to say to my wife or spouse.

750
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 That's what I need to say to my children.

751
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 I need to begin to speak words of life where I've been speaking deaf."

752
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 And the starting point is to say, "I am not a slave to fear."

753
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
 Or whatever it might be for you.

754
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Father, I want to pray that you would release these people in this room

755
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 to a greater sense of healing from sin.

756
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 For those in this room that need to deal with some sin in their lives

757
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 because of the words that are coming out of their mouths,

758
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 Lord, I want to pray for that conviction of your spirit in them in Jesus' name.

759
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 Lord, I pray for those of us who have been hurt deeply.

760
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 And because of that hurt, we recognize that some of the things that come out of our mouths

761
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 are more aligned with the enemy's words than they are with the Lord's words.

762
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 Father, would you then speak to me really loudly about who you see me to be?

763
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 And then would I in faith declare prophetically out of my own mouth

764
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 the very person that you've created in me?

765
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 What is bound on earth is bound in heaven.

766
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 What is loose on earth is loose in heaven.

767
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 I pray you would loose healing in the name of Jesus, Lord, over the people in this room.

768
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

769
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 Everyone say, "Amen."

770
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Hey, let's worship together.

771
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 Maybe you can do that.

772
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 You can take a moment.

773
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 And in a moment, we're going to have a time for prayer.

774
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 And if you would like to receive prayer, we'll make space for you to do that

775
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 before we close our service.
