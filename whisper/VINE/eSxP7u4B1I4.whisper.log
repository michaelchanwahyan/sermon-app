[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   So good to have you back, right?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Yes, come on.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Applause]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, when I was in university,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I was very proud
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   because I made
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   the men's basketball team.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   I know.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [Laughs]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   And on my team, there was actually
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   incredible players. They were really good.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   One of them, so much so that
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   every summer, he
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   practiced with NBA players.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So it was like he, I was living in the
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Northwest, at that time, there was the Seattle
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Supersonics, they now moved to, I think, Oklahoma City
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   or something. And so he
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   was playing with some of those players.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Now,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   on the men's team, there usually
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   was seven
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   or eight players that got to play
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   most of the time.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I was not one of them.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   So it was the other ones
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   played. Now, the first year, I was okay
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   with that. You know, the other players are better.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   That's fine. Fantastic.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   You know, go ahead.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Second year,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   there was one guy
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   that was playing my position who
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   was in that eight-person
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   rotation. And I felt like
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   that I had the
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   similar skill set as he did.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And I
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   started comparing myself to him.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And as
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I was doing that, I was like, you know,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I really
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   would deserve to have
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   a spot and be able to
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   play and be in that rotation.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   At the very least, I should get
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   the opportunity to prove myself a few
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   times. Why does he get to
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   play? Why don't I get to play?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And so I started to
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   complain and
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   grumble inside my heart
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   as I compared myself.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now, before that,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I was actually feeling great. I was so
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   proud to be on the team.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   But when I started comparing, all that went out the window.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Isn't that interesting how that
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   goes, right? Like when you start
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   complaining, like maybe
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   something that we enjoyed before, something
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   else good, suddenly doesn't
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   seem that good anymore.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Now, we all experience that.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   You know, whether that's
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   in your workplace, in a relationship,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   in
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   church.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   You know, in all these different
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   places we experience that. That's when we
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   start comparing ourselves, we get
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   tunnel vision.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   We start focusing in on what the other person
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   has that we don't have that we should
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   have.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And we kind of lose joy
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   along the way. Like we stop
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   seeing the good things that
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   God is doing in our lives.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And a lot of times, there's a lot
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   of negative emotions
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   with that as well, right?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And so what I want to do with you today,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I want to explore with you a question is
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   how can we break
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   out of or
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   escape from this
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   pattern of comparing
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   ourselves with others that
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   brings us down? You know, how
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   do we get out of that? Because it's
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   so destructive and
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   it's like kills our joy.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You know,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   what do we do? And what does God's
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   word have to say to us about that?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So we are
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   in a new sermon series
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   that we have entitled "Living
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   the Kingdom Parables."
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And Jesus, if you're familiar
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   with him, I think like 30 or 40 percent
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   of the words in the Bible
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   from him are actually parables.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So it was one of the major ways that he
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   taught. And for those
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   of you who are not so 100 percent sure about what is
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   a parable, that sounds
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   interesting, but what is this? Here's a little
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   definition. A parable
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   is a comparison that employs
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   an ordinary circumstance
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   in everyday life to illustrate
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   a spiritual truth.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So Jesus uses everyday examples,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   but with that he's actually
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   illustrating, you know,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   a truth about something else.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   in this series we're going to look at five different
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   parables. Parables
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   also, they tend
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   to provoke us.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   They tend to stir some emotions in us
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   because there's something in them that
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   rubs us the wrong way. And it's
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   usually right at that point
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   where we are rubbed the wrong way
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   that God wants to say something
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   to us. That's why Jesus uses
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   them because they're so powerful.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And so I'm really excited about this series
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and the heart behind it
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   is that we can align
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   ourselves with a kingdom
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   mindset, with kingdom living.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   With the things where we are
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   not aligned with God's
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   will, Jesus' desire for us,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   his followers, his disciples.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Now in just
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   a moment we're going to look at the parable
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   of the laborers in the vineyard.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But before
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   we get there
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I want to set a little bit of context.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Actually
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   there's a lot of things that
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   could be said about the context. It's a lot more
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   than I usually would do, but I'm going to
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   try to keep it very short.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Basically there's a story
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   where a rich young man
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   he comes to Jesus and he wants to understand
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   how can I have eternal life?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But in the process of talking
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   with Jesus
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   he chooses
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   his wealth over following
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Jesus and he walks away
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   sad, but he's just not able
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   to let go of what Jesus
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   asked him to do.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Now in response to this, Peter
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   who was listening
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   who has left things behind
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   he's like, "Hey, Jesus!
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   What about us?" I want to read with you
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   actually something that he says. So it's Matthew
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   19 verse 27. He says,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   "We have left everything to follow you.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   What then will be
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   there for us?"
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And it's interesting
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   because
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Jesus, he does tell Peter
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   that there will be rewards
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   for him leaving everything, that he actually
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   will bless them in incredible ways.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But he also
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   tells this parable
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   in response to Peter's
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   question. Because there's something
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   about the question, there's
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   something about the comparison that Peter did
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   to the rich young ruler where Jesus
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   wants to say a little bit more.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Where there's something
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   else that needs to be said.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And this is where we're going to pick up.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   So we're in Matthew chapter 20
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   we're studying the response that says this,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "For the kingdom
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   of heaven is like a landowner
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   who went out early in the morning
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   to hire workers for his vineyard.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   He agreed to pay them
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   a denarius for the day and
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   sent them into his vineyard.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   About nine in the morning he went out and saw
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   others standing in the marketplace
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   doing nothing. He told
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and I will pay you whatever's right.'
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So they went.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   He went out again about
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   noon and about three in the afternoon
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   did the same thing. About five in the
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   afternoon he went out and found
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   still others standing around.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   He asked them, 'Why have you been standing
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   here all day long doing
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   nothing?' 'Because no
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   one has hired us,' they answered.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   He said to them,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   'You also go and work
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   in my vineyard.'
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And when evening came, the owner
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   of the vineyard said to his foreman,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   'Call the workers and pay them their wages.'
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Beginning with the last
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   ones hired and going to the first.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   So the workers who were hired
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   about five in the afternoon
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   came and each received a denarius.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   So when those came who
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   were hired first, they expected
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   to receive more.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   But each one
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   of them also received a denarius.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   When they
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   received it, they began to grumble
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   against the landowner.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   These who were hired
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   last worked only one hour.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   They said, 'And you have made
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   them equal to us
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   who have borne the
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   burden of the work
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   and the heat of the day.'
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   But he answered
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   one of them, 'I'm not being
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   unfair to you, friend.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Take your pay and go.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I want to give
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   the one who was hired
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   last the same as I gave to you.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Don't I have the right to do
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   what I want with my own money?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Or are you envious
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   because I am generous?'
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So the last will be first
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and the first will be
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   last."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Wow.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   That's a lot, isn't it?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   So let's
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   unpack that. Let's walk
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   through this parable. Let me highlight
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   some things along the way.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So the first thing is, in this
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   parable, it's, again,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   it's an everyday scene. It's a laborer looking
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   for workers, the worker's vineyard.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   people, he finds people
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   in the marketplace, he tells them,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   'You want to come work in my vineyard? There's probably
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   the harvest. These workers are bringing the harvest.'
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And so they agree
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   to work for one denarius,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   which basically was enough money
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   to pay for food for the family for that day.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But then
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   what's interesting is that the landowner
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   actually keeps going out, and it's also
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   interesting that the landowner does that.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You know, it's him going
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   out and hiring workers.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Not somebody else, not one of his
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   employees, but he does it.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And so there's other people he meets, and
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   they agree
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   that they will be paid whatever
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   is right, in verse 4.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   So he tells them, 'I'll pay you
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   something that's fair.'
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And then he goes out at
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   5 o'clock, which by this
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   time there's only one hour left of work days.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So work days usually were 12 hours.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   So there's only one hour left.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And he
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   still finds people standing around,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and he's kind of confused by that. He's like, 'Why
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   are they standing around? Why are you doing nothing?'
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And they say, 'No one has
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   hired us.'
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   no one, in other words,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   wants them.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   When I lived in the
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   US, I one time rode along with a
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   contractor who actually picked up
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   workers.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You know, it was a place where they
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   were waiting for work for the day.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And it was interesting
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   because the contractors, they actually get to know
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   the workers. And then a lot
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   of times, they know who they like to
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   work with, but they also know maybe the
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   person who doesn't work that
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   well. And
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   so, I can imagine
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   in the setting, you know,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   the workers, they knew these guys, and they're like, 'Ah, we
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   don't want them working for us.' So
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   they didn't hire them, but they hired the other guys.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   But this landowner, he hires
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   them nonetheless for one hour.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   So it's interesting. It's kind of
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   something precarious, something
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   that should make us curious.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   at the end of the day, 12 hours
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   worked. You know,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   you have people working different hours. Some
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   work 12, and some work one
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   hour. Now, we have
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   to remember that this is a parable
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   because it's
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   easy to kind of lose track of that.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   So in this
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   parable, the landowner is
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   God, who's calling
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   people into his kingdom to be his kingdom
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   workers. So
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   that's something we need to keep in mind as we continue walking
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   through it, okay? But let's
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   go on, and this is where things get
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   interesting, the next part. This is where
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   it gets juicy, as they
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   say.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   So in verse 8 to 6,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   we see that the
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   landowner tells the foreman, "Call the people
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   together. I want to pay them."
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And he decides to pay them
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   from those who came last. He
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   wants to pay them first, and
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   then pay all of them until the ones
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   who started in the morning.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Now, what's
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   absolutely incredible
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   is that the landowner
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   pays those who came and
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   worked for one hour.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   He pays them one denarius, which is
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   the same that he had agreed
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   upon for the others.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And this kind of stirs
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   some excitement. Actually, at this point in time,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   nobody minds that, that they're getting paid a denarius
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   because
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   they are expecting
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   that they will receive
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   more.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   But when it's their turn to pay, to be
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   paid, guess what happens, right?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   We already read it. They just get one denarius.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Ooh.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   They worked 12 hours,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   the other ones worked one hour,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and they get paid the same.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I don't know if you've
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   ever been in a work
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   situation where you do
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   a lot more, maybe somebody
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   else is chilling and playing video games,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   and you get paid the same. It just doesn't
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   feel good, does it?
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I also,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   if this was today, I wonder
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   what people would do on social media.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Right? They might go on
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   X, is that what it's called?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Twitter, is it called X? I can't remember.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Okay, yeah, so they go on X,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   shoot out some tweets.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   If there was Google Review, they would write
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   a nasty review about this
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   horrible land
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   owner who is so unfair.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And I think we can feel, we can have
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   sympathy with
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   that. There does seem to be some unfairness
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   from our perspective, right?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And we can feel that.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   So it's no surprise
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   that they actually grumble and they complain.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   So in verse 11, we're told they begin
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   to grumble against the land owner, so they're angry
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   against them. And then in verse 12,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   we're told, "These who were hired
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   last worked only one hour."
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   They said, "And you have made them
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   equal to us,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   who have borne the burden
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   of the work and the heat of the day."
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   You know, "Hey,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   you're making them the same as us, but we
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   earned, we deserve more than them.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   We earned this, we have the right to this."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   You know, that's what they're saying.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Like, "We're not equal to
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   these other guys that nobody wanted to hire
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   that just worked one hour.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   We should get more."
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And they're just ticked off.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   But I want you to notice something.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   All of this grumbling
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   and frustration,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   the only reason why it happens
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   is because they're
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   comparing themselves.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   If the foreman would have paid
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   the first-comers first and sent
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   them off, they would have gotten what they
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   agreed upon, right? One denarius,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   and they go and they would have been happy.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   But it was only when they compared themselves
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   that they got angry and frustrated
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and felt like they were treated wrongly.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   So comparison
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   can turn something that is
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   good into something
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   sour.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   It's like me with
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   basketball. I was proud to be
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   on the team.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I felt amazing. I made the college
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   basketball team.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   But then when I compared myself to the one guy
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   who was like similar skill level, looking back
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   he was better than me, just being honest.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   But when I compared myself,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   then I was grumbling, then I was complaining
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   and suddenly something that was good
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   didn't feel that good.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And my joy
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   was drained.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   But then
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   let's continue the story. So the landowner
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   he actually responds in verse 30, he says
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   but he answered one of them,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   "I'm not being unfair to you, friend.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Didn't you agree to work for
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   a denarius?" He reminds him of the facts.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   "Take your pay and go.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I want to give the ones who was hired the last
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   the same as I gave you.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Don't I have the right to do what I want with my
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   own money? Or are you
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   envious because I
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   am generous?"
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Now it's interesting because
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   the workers, they're actually claiming
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   that the landlord is unjust and
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   unfair.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   That he is treating them wrongly.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   But he's saying, "I've actually done what
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   I promised you. You agree to this."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   So he's highlighting that.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And they're
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   trying to make this about a justice
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   issue and he shifts
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   it and he says, "You're upset.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You're envious because I'm
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   generous." So he's saying
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   this is not about justice.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   This is about envy.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   This is about my generosity
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   with which you struggle with,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   which you don't want for the other
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   person. That's why you're upset.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Ay-yah.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   This is where we get to the heart issue that Jesus
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   wants to address.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   That he wanted to address in Peter.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   That he wants to address in us.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   He asks the question, "Are you envious
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   because I'm generous?"
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And the truth
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   is they are envious because
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   he is generous.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   They are envious
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   of the grace and mercy
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   that the workers
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   that nobody wants to hire
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   that maybe are not as skilled,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   that look like they have a messy life,
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   that maybe smell like alcohol,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   don't look
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   the way we think somebody
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   who is a good worker looks
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   because the landowner
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   showed them grace and mercy.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And so he's saying,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   "I'm envious
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   of the Lord and grace and mercy."
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   That's why they're ticked off.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Now, at this point in time, again,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   we have to remember we're reading a parable.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   This is not a workplace
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   situation. This is Jesus
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   using life
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   circumstance to explain something else.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And so, Jesus
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   in this parable,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   as I already said, the landowner represents
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   God, and it's
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   actually God calling people into his
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   kingdom, inviting
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   them to be workers in
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   his kingdom, inviting them to give
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   them some work in the vineyard.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   So when you're a
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Christian, God has
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   called you and he has given you a place
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   in the vineyard to work, every
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   one of us.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And it is all
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   by the grace and by the mercy
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   of God. None of us deserve
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   it. None of us are entitled
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   to it. It is 100
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   percent the grace of God
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   that he calls us
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   and that we get to be part of his
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   family, that we get to be
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   his workers in the vineyard.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   But the
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   reason the
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   early workers in this parable are so upset
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   is because they have forgotten that.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And guess what? We forget that as
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   well.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And we start actually thinking
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   about our relationship with God
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   a lot of times
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   as we think about relationships in business.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   You know, they're transactional.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   You owe me something.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   I did this, God, and you
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   owe me this.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Why should he or she have this?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I have
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   done this. I am entitled
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   to that, but you're not giving it to
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   me. And so we start
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   grumbling against the landowners. We
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   start grumbling against God.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And our relationship with God
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   starts growing sour
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   because
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   we have lost sight that this
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   whole thing is all by the
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   mercy, by the grace,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   by the love, by the
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   generosity of God.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   In the kingdom of God,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   it isn't about earning
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   or deserving, but
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   about receiving, saving,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   grace, and joyfully
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   serving God.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Now, what does all this have
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   to do with us? I know I was
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   just walking us through the story
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   trying to help us understand some of the
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   details a little bit better.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   But what is it that this parable
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   exposes and challenges within our
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   hearts, and what does Jesus
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   call us to
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   instead?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Well, the first thing is
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   we theoretically love grace.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   We theoretically like
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   it. We like it when
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   God is gracious to us,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   when he's good to us. Oh, thank
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   you, God, for the promotion.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Thank you, God, for this that you've done in my life.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I love you. You're amazing.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So we love grace
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   theoretically. Well, we
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   start not liking it
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   when God's generosity and goodness
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   comes to somebody else, when it
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   comes to our competitor,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   when it comes to the other family
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   member, when it comes to
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   what you can fill in the blank.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   So theoretically, we like
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   grace, and we're like, "Yeah, I love grace. We're a
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   grace church."
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But then when it actually comes
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   down to it, a lot of times we don't like it.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Is this true?
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Yeah? I think so, right?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Come on.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Just having an honest conversation here.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And so perhaps
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   we envy a relationship,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   a promotion,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   success, praise,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   gifts that people have,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   scholarships they've been awarded,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   favors from someone
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   you can fill in the blank.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Where have you
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   envied God's
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   generosity towards somebody else?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Where do you find yourself
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   being envious right now, and
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   comparing yourself, and feeling
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   like you are entitled,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   they shouldn't be entitled?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And by the way, I chose a very
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   safe example with the basketball team
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   on purpose, you know,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   keeping it light and easy.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Where are you
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   envious right now?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Where you feel like you deserve
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   something, God owes you something.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   You know, and when we compare
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   this to the legalistic
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   religion within ourselves
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   that actually is exposed,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   when I say,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   "I deserve this, why is God
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   giving the person that?"
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Really what we're saying is,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   "I earned this."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   But as we've said,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   everything from God is something
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   we get by grace, by His mercy.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   It's not something that we earn.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   We just receive it by grace and mercy.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   But so it exposes
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   our heart that actually
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   there's some works religion in there.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   In us.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   You know that,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and this is what Jesus is kind of teasing out
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   in Peter's heart, in his listeners
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   heart, in our heart.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   And we say, "That person
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   should not be of equal status to me.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   I should be of higher status.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Because I did so and so,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and that person is not the same as me."
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   You know, and we go on and on and on.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   So you will never
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   see the goodness of God
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   when you envy His generosity
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   towards others.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   It gives you a tunnel vision.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   You lose track of it.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And I don't know if you've,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   you know, if you struggle with that,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   it's a real struggle.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Sometimes it is hard to get out of that.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   And I actually want us to be compassionate
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and graceful towards one another,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   even when we find ourselves in those places.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   You know, but it's
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   when you're so focused
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   on what somebody else has
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and you haven't, and you feel like you deserve it,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   man,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   you start losing track of all the goodness
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   of God in your life.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   You're not able to see it.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And it's just,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   it's just not a
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   good place.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And God doesn't want us to live in that place.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   You know, He wants us to see His goodness,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   His love, His grace,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   His mercy.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   He wants you to see it.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   He wants you to know it.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He wants you to be confident in it.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   That He is faithful to you,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   His people.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   But you will never see
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   the goodness of God when you are envious
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   of His generosity towards others.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   So what's the anti-door to that?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   What do we do?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   How can we get out of this comparison trap
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   that leaves us being jealous
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   and envious?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Well, the anti-door
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   is that we start
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   practicing and seeing
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   and giving thanks
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   to God's goodness and mercy.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   That we cultivate this attitude
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   of gratitude.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I came up with another way
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   right before the sermon, that we practice
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   the art of seeing God's goodness
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   in our lives.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   You know, we struggle with that.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   But when we do that,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   we start giving God thanks
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   for, "Wow, God, thank you for your mercy.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Thank you for salvation.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Thank you for your faithfulness.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Thank you that you are with me,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   that I know your presence.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Thank you that I'm breathing today.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Thank you for my health.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Thank you for whatever God has been good to you.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Just give Him thanks."
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   You know, it's amazing when we do that.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Now, there's a biblical scholar,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Michael J. Wilkins.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   He defines gratitude this way.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   He says, "Gratitude is the response
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   of the believing person
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   to the goodness of God's grace
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   in creation and redemption,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   making gratitude
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   the authentic hallmark of the disciple
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   of Jesus."
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   So gratitude, so our thanks,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   our praise is a response
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   to Jesus. And our lives
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   are meant to be
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   a response to the goodness, to the mercy
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   of God, where we say,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   "Thank you, Jesus, for placing,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   for calling me into your vineyard.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And I'm going to serve you in this patch
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   that you put me in.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   And I believe that you have a purpose for me
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   here in this patch, that you
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   don't make mistakes.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And I'm going to joyfully serve you
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   and work for you. And I'm not going to be
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   focused on rewards or who gets
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   what. I'm just going to live
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   in gratitude
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   of your generosity
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   towards me, your goodness towards me."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And you know, when we do that,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   there's something really freeing.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   When we just know that God loves us,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   that we are secure, that we're
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   not going to miss out, that He
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   cares for us, that He has our
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   back, it just frees
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   us to love other people, to
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   serve Him and not be concerned
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   about us
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   being entitled to this or to that.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And if I only had this,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   then I'd be happy and all
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   of that. And He should not have that
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   and she should not have that.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   It's just amazing when we
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   live in this gratitude and
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   just see God's mercy, that we're just freed
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   to love other people,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   to do the work of God that He gives us
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   and to just enjoy His goodness.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I was at a point
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   in my life where
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   this was not easy.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   It's not always easy to
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   have the attitude of gratitude.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And maybe if you're really feeling bad
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   and somebody tells you, "You should have the attitude of gratitude!"
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   You know, you're like,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   "Hmm...
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   I don't know if I want to hear this right now."
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So I've shared
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   some of the story before, but
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   basically, you know,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   several years ago,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I had significant loss of my life,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   loss of relationship,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   loss of home,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   loss of my job.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And, you know, really
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   I was like, "God, I'm
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   serving you.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   I was a
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   pastor. I love you.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Why is my life
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   falling apart? And why do
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   people, maybe who seem like they don't care
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   about you that much, why are they doing good?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   This is so unfair.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   I deserve this."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   So I was complaining.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I was grumbling.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And I have to say, you know, sometimes when
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   just our life
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   knocks us down, sometimes that's where we're at.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   You know, it's not like we can always
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   ride away in
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   the ideal place.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   But that's where I was.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   But it's interesting
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   when we
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   say, "Why do they have such a good life?"
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Actually, the reality
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   is,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   do we really know that they have a good life?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Do we know that
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   they don't have marital problems?
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Do we know that they're
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   not lonely in the evening
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   and there's tears every night?
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Do we know
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   that they're not carrying
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   some baggage from the past
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   that's just heavy, and that's just
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   impacting them even today?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   You know, is that other person's
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   life, is it really
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   better?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And because we just
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   see the facade, right?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   That we are jealous of.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And like, "Why is God generous to this person?"
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   But if we actually would swap lives
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   like completely,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   maybe their life is really not that great.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Maybe God's just,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   you know, pouring out some goodness in this
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   area of their lives just to encourage them, because
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   the rest is so difficult.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   But anyhow, I was
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   not thinking this way. You know, it's like, "Why
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   do they have a good life, and
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   right now my life is a mess?"
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And so I was talking to a friend,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   and I was,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   you know, sharing all this stuff with him,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and he was encouraging
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   me to see God's
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   goodness. Now I have to say, he did listen to me several
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   times, then only after a
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   while, so this was like after three conversations
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   or he started to talk to me
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   about seeing God's goodness. It was not the first thing
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   he told me. And
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   I shared with him that there was
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   a family
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   that took me in.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   You know, as I had lost my
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   relationship, my home, my job,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   that they welcomed me
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   into their home.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   my goal was, "I'm just going to be here.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I'm going to hide in this room
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   so that they allow me to stay here longer,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   that they don't get annoyed and
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   want me out of the house, you know, just try to
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   clean up everything
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   good." But they
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   didn't just want me in their house. They actually
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   invited me to be part of their family.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I had dinner with them.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I went shopping with them.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I went wine tasting with them,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   which was a lot of fun.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   You know,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   they just really loved
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   me and embraced me in this
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   difficult time where I was like
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   a mess, crying and all
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   of that. And
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   my friend says, "Don't you see
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   how much God loves you?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   How he's shown you his
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   goodness in this difficult time through
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   your family?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Don't you see that?"
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Wow.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And that, I really needed
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   that because I couldn't see it on my own.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And I could
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   see God's goodness. And this was
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   a turning point for me where I could
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   start giving God thanks
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   and
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   praise him, you know, for
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   his love and care for me despite
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   the difficulties and challenges that were
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   going on. And I was just saying, "Thank you.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Thank you, Lord." And I started
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   slowly, you know,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   naming the things in which God
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   has been good to me.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Now, when
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   we have God's
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   grace and mercy, you know, in view, when we
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   get to see it, it is so
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   powerful.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Now, for me, there
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   was this complaining against God. Now, I don't
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   think that I saw God as, like, you know,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   the evil landowner who's so
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   unjust to me. But it was a little bit of that.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And it's amazing when
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   we see God's grace and mercy,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   we actually can start
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   seeing God again as a loving
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   father instead of as that evil landowner
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   who's just harsh to us and who
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   messes with our lives, you know, and where
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   we're upset and we're angry and we're sour.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   And he wants
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   to restore that.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   You know, he wants to restore our relationship
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   with him. He wants to
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   restore our joy.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   He doesn't want us to live
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   in this place of envy
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   and complaining.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   now, one thing that's also amazing about
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Jesus, you know, his saving
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   work, is that he
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   gives us forgiveness. Because
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   actually, when we're complaining,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   when we're saying, "Why are you
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   giving them that and not me?"
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   You know, there's actually pride
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   in our hearts.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   We actually need forgiveness for that.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   You know, and he
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   forgives us and he gives us his mercy
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and his grace.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   And he actually helps us
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   overcome,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   you know, that so that we can be free,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   that we can receive his grace and his
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   mercy and goodness and just walk in that.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Now, I want to invite the
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   worship team to come up.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And my sense,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   you know, for today,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   is, you know, as I shared,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Jesus, he tells these parables
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   to just highlight things in our hearts, where he's
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   inviting us to have a different
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   perspective. Where he
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   wants to also bring healing,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   you know, the parts of our thinking,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   parts of our acting,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   that are not aligned with him.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   he's inviting us today.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   He's inviting you today
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   to
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   respond to him, to
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   come to him. Maybe
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   it's asking
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Jesus, "I'm
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   not seeing your goodness. I'm
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   not seeing what I should
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   be grateful for.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Can you help me see it?"
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Maybe
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   that's what you bring to him. And I believe
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   that he will help you see it, you know, as
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   you ask him for that. That he will
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   show you, you know, his
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   goodness. Maybe not right in the moment, but he will
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   highlight that to you.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Maybe it's, maybe God wants
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   to restore
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   your relationship with him. Maybe you've been
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   sour, you've been bitter, you've been angry
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   at God. Like, "How dare
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   God do this to me? You know,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   why does he give, he's generous to them,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   but not to me?"
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And so maybe, God
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   is calling some of you,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   you know, just to find healing in that
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   relationship. To not see
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   God as this angry,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   unfair, unjust
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   taskmaster in your life,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   but as your heavenly
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Father who loves you.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   You know, who cares
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   for you.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Who just pours his mercy
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and his goodness out over you.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   And so what I, what I want
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   to do right now, I just want to invite you actually to
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   just talk to God right now.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And just to talk to him about what he's
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   been speaking to you about.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And then in a little bit I'll,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   I'll lead us into what's
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   next. So let's, let's do that right now.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
