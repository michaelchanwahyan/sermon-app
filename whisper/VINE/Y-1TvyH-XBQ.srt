00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 When I was 17 years old, a few years ago, my life changed.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 I remember I was at work and a friend came in with some devastating news.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 My boyfriend had been killed in a road accident.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Tragically, the car that he was in hit a lorry, head on collision, he was killed instantly.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I was 17 and that news knocked me down in so many ways.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I had a vague understanding that God was good.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I had been raised in a loving home.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 My parents were practicing Mormons, so I had a concept of God.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 But the death tragically hardened my heart.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And so therefore all forms of faith and religion, to me, became irrelevant.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 After all, how could a loving God let that happen?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 A young life, a good life, needlessly taken.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And my philosophy in life was therefore shaped.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Life was short. Life was to be lived.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Death was the end. That was it.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And our time on earth really was meaningless.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And to fill the emptiness in my life, I looked for satisfaction in many different places.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Fast forward a couple of years and I found myself in Spain, Barcelona.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Anybody from Barcelona?

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 It's a beautiful place.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 When we travel again, yeah, online.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Hola, como estas?

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 When we get to travel again, hopefully you can visit Barcelona, beautiful city.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 It was there that my life was changed once again.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But this time, instead of death, I found life.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Instead of emptiness, I found love.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I encountered God.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It wasn't anything super dramatic.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It was actually just in a dream.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 But in my dream, I was standing in a church and Jesus appeared to me.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And I just knew it was Jesus, although I didn't know much about who he was.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And he told me, "Karla, I want you to shine for me."

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And that was it. Then I woke up.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I can't really explain that that change had in me.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 In many ways, it was gradual.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 But in other ways, it was instant.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And I found myself suddenly in a place of longing to know God more.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Through being in his presence, through reading his Bible,

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I would spend hours alone just chatting with God.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I would devour scripture.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I was fascinated by the gospels.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I was fascinated by the life of Jesus, the man that he was and the things that he did.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 The Holy Spirit was a companion to me.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And my time in Spain was truly special because it birthed in me a hunger

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 to always pursue God, to be in his presence.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 And in pursuing him, I got to know him more, to understand his love.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And even though I was living in a foreign land with no friends and no real future,

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I found myself completely satisfied.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So today, my question to us is, how do we pursue God to know him?

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And how can we enter into his presence, experience him in new and profound ways?

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And as we start this new series in the Psalms, I turn to Psalm 63,

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 one of my favorite Psalms, to share with us some insights about what it looks like

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 to desire God's presence and the ways that we can pursue God to get to know him more deeply.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And the bold declaration that the psalmist's relationship with God speaks of

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 reminds me of my days in Spain when God's presence was all I needed.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And it's my prayer today that as we look at this Psalm, you would be stirred,

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I would be stirred, we would be stirred to really hunger for God's presence.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And in doing so, we come to know him just that little bit more.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 So before we read Psalm 63, I want to give some context.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 We know the title tells us that it is a Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Now, commentators generally agree the Psalm was likely to be written by David,

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 belongs either to David's wilderness years before he came to the throne of Israel,

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 when he was on the run from King Saul, or to his brief exile from the throne

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 during the rebellion of his son, Absalom.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 But regardless of whether it was before or after he was king of Israel,

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 we know it was a time when David is on the run, away from the safety and security of his city,

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 hiding in the arid desert lands, his future uncertain.

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And knowing this context makes the Psalm even more amazing,

69
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 because David with his life in danger, physically and mentally exhausted,

70
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 doesn't focus on physical wants and desires, but rather focuses on his spiritual needs,

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 a longing for God's presence, a satisfaction in who God is,

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 and an assurance that his God will deliver him.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 So as we read together, let's keep that in mind.

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Now you can watch it on screen, read it on screen, you can get out your phones,

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 or your iPhones, or whatever, or you can close your eyes as I read.

76
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 "You God are my God. Earnestly I seek you. I thirst for you.

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 My whole being longs for you in a dry and parched land where there is no water.

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory,

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 because your love is better than life.

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 My lips will glorify you. I will praise you as long as I live.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And in your name I will lift up my hands.

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I will be fully satisfied as with the riches of foods.

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 With singing lips my mouth will praise you.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 On my bed I remember you. I think of you through the watches of the night,

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 because you are my help. I sing in the shadow of your wings.

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I cling to you. Your right hand upholds me.

87
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Those who want to kill me will be destroyed.

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 They will go down to the depths of the earth.

89
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 But the king will rejoice in God.

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 All who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced."

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 From this psalm and other psalms of David, we know that no matter what season David is in,

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 the ups and the downs, he always comes back to pursue God and his presence.

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 I like David has ups and downs.

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 It makes me feel better about those times where I'm saying,

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 "God, what are you doing?" or "God, where are you?"

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 It helps also knowing that in pursuing the presence of God,

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 it's so important for us as Christians,

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 because we cannot truly know God unless we know his presence.

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Unless we know God, we will struggle with that genuine satisfaction.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 As Paul writes, "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.

102
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I know what it is to be in need, what it is to have plenty.

103
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation,

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 whether well-fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or what.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I can do all this through him who gives me strength."

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 The secret that Paul talks about is found in the relationship that we have with God,

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 in knowing who he is and the love that he has for us.

108
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 So how do we pursue God to know him?

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Psalm 63 helps us.

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 First, we see confession as an important key.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 At the very beginning of the Psalm, David declares to God that he,

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Elohim, was David's God in the most fundamental sense.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 "Oh God, you are my God."

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 That was a significant statement by David.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Polytheism, the worship of multiple deities, was very common during David's life.

116
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 All the nations had their own gods, and even amongst the Israelites,

117
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 God's chosen people, that temptation to worship other gods was strong.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 And time and time we see it.

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 They failed to stay true and faithful to their God,

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 even when they experienced incredible miracles and God's deliverance time and time again.

121
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 But David, for all of his failures, did not worship any other gods.

122
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And he led Israel as a king devoted to worshiping the one true God.

123
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And we hear in Psalm 63, right at the start, his allegiance to Yahweh.

124
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 This is significant for us today.

125
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Deuteronomy tells us, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone."

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 "Hear, O Hong Kong, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone."

127
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 In Timothy, "For there is one God, one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."

128
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.

129
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 No one comes to the Father except through me."

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Therefore, if we confess to know God, we're choosing to believe in Jesus,

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 we are aligning ourselves to his teaching.

132
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 There is only one God.

133
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 There is one way to him through Jesus.

134
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Now, I know that is not culturally popular, right?

135
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 As a pastor, when people find out what I do, often they will say to me,

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 "Oh, yes, Christian, yes, Jesus, I believe in Jesus too.

137
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I also pray to Buddha."

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Or, "Well, you know what?

139
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 I think all religions, all faiths, they're all good.

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 They all lead to that one place.

141
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 We're all going to heaven."

142
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 To truly know God means to choose allegiance to Jesus,

143
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 recognizing he is the way, he is the truth, he is the life.

144
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 To enter into God's presence, we must have that personal relationship with Jesus.

145
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And if you're here today and you don't know Jesus,

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 or maybe you believe in God and you consider all religions as a way to God,

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 to really know God and his presence, we must confess Jesus is our Savior.

148
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 For those of us that know Jesus, we call ourselves Christians,

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 but how do we live out the confession of our faith?

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Are we publicly open about our beliefs?

151
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 David glorified God with his lips.

152
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 My lips will glorify you.

153
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I will praise you.

154
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And with his hands, I will lift up my hands.

155
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 And for David, the lifting of the hands was not only the common posture of prayer

156
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 amongst ancient Hebrews, it also displayed that anticipation of gratefully receiving God

157
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 and that sense of surrender to him.

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Do we lift up our hands in surrender?

159
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 What do we do with our hands?

160
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Do our actions glorify God?

161
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 What is our public witness to those around us and the things that we say

162
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 and the things that we do?

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 We can sing songs and raise our hands in worship on a Sunday,

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 but how do our hands and lips confess our faith Monday through to Saturday?

165
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 So how do we pursue God to know him?

166
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 We do this by confessing Jesus as Lord and living surrendered, obedient lives.

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And then next we see meditation as an important key to pursuing God to know him.

168
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 David says, "I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and glory."

169
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 David was not at the sanctuary when he created this psalm.

170
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 He was in the wilderness of Judah, far from the tabernacle tent

171
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 that housed God's presence in Jerusalem, far from the safety and the security of his city.

172
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Yet he knew that God's sanctuary was not only a place,

173
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 but a spiritual concept that could be entered by faith no matter where a person is.

174
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 He had witnessed God's power and glory, not just confined to a physical place,

175
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 God's presence is not just confined to this building,

176
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 but he knew God's presence was everywhere around him.

177
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 He knew God's power. He knew his love.

178
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And so he declared, "Love, your love is better than life."

179
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 That Hebrew word for love that David refers to is chesed.

180
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It's the idea of faithful love in action.

181
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's expressed in both God's loyalty to his covenant and his love to his people.

182
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Theologian John Oswald describes chesed as a completely undeserved kindness and generosity.

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 The scholar Daryl Bock writes, "Chesed is wrapping up in itself all the positive attributes of God,

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 love, covenant faithfulness, mercy, grace, kindness, loyalty, in short, acts of devotion,

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 loving kindness that go on beyond the requirements of duty."

186
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 This is the type of love David understood,

187
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 a covenant loving kindness that David declared was better and more meaningful than life itself.

188
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 David was so moved and overwhelmed by the greatness of God's love.

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 He tasted it. He knew it, the vastness and worth of it.

190
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Do we know God like that?

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Do we love God more than life itself?

192
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Do we really know his chesed love?

193
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Of course, loving God more than life doesn't have to end in anything as dramatic as martyrdom,

194
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 but really knowing God's love means we do not give up on God,

195
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 even when things do not go as we had hoped.

196
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 I think we would all agree that things have not gone as we would have hoped or imagined these past two years.

197
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Do I hear an amen?

198
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Do I hear an amen online?

199
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 No one would have anticipated how our city would have fragmented in the protests of 2019

200
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 and how fears for our future have led so many to leave or think about leaving Hong Kong,

201
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 or how COVID would impact us all in different ways that we are still yet really able to fully comprehend.

202
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I know we all have a story to tell where things have not gone as we would have hoped or we would have planned.

203
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 We too find ourselves in a dry and weary land where there is no water.

204
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 In July 2019, as one of the senior leaders of this church, with Andrew away on sabbatical, much needed sabbatical,

205
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 it was a very challenging time for us to navigate through the unrest unfolding in the city,

206
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 the impact on our staff and on you, our congregation.

207
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 There were times when Wan Chai was literally on fire and ensuring the safety of our people was a priority.

208
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 And at the same time, knowing that God had called us to be a light in this city,

209
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 a place of refuge and a place for restoration.

210
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 The streets were full of hurting people.

211
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 So walking in that tension, dealing with the many differences, was not easy.

212
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And then during this time when I needed to be focused, sharp, on the ball, able to make lots of decisions, I got sick.

213
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 For weeks I lived in a fog of pain that often brought me to my knees in agony.

214
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And for those of you that suffer with pain, you'll know what I mean.

215
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 There were times I ended up, well twice I ended up in A&E.

216
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And honestly, every day was just a survival, taking pain medication to get through that time.

217
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 I didn't understand why I was suffering this way.

218
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 I had a job to do, a church to help lead, a family to raise.

219
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 But yet, through this time, the protests and the pain, I learned to be completely dependent on God.

220
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 By seeking his presence, his love sustained me.

221
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And looking back, I see the many different ways that he carried me through this difficult time.

222
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 At the start of the pandemic, my son was hit by a bus.

223
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Every parent's worst nightmare.

224
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 A call that told us our son had been in an accident and it was serious.

225
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Honestly, it's a miracle he survived.

226
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 He was on his bike, riding down the road, the hill, when a bus on the other side of the road overtook another vehicle and didn't see Ben.

227
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 It was a head-on collision.

228
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Ben was rushed to hospital and thankfully, 18 months later, he's made a full recovery.

229
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Yay!

230
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 But it was a terrifying time.

231
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And COVID restrictions didn't help.

232
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It meant that we were unable to be with him as he was kept in hospital for a week.

233
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I did what I could only do.

234
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I sought the presence of God as I knew only he would be able to sustain me through this.

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 This was out of my control.

236
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And he did.

237
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 He carried us as a family through this dark period.

238
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And then just six weeks ago, we find ourselves once again waiting outside an operation theater.

239
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 This time it's our daughter who had to go through major surgery.

240
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I've known God's faithfulness to us as a family in the past.

241
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 And this time would be no different.

242
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 I turned to God once again to be in his presence, to allow him to minister to my weariness and fears.

243
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I pursued his presence on my daily runs or in my quiet moments as I travel to work on a ferry.

244
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I sought his presence in the middle of the night when I could not sleep.

245
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I knew his presence in my time here at church, gathered with you, worshipping, listening to God's word.

246
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Praise God, our daughter is recovering well.

247
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Our family has ridden the roller coaster of emotions, but even in the hard circumstances,

248
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I see God's care and love for our family.

249
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And God wants you to know this love too.

250
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It's in the good times, but it's in those difficult times too.

251
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And like me, David's meditation on God's enduring and committed love was often through the night.

252
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 You know, the slow advancing hours after midnight.

253
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 David said, "On my bed I remember you.

254
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I think of you through the watches of the night."

255
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Often insights of who God is and his love come at night.

256
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Do we give God this time?

257
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 How often do we really slow down to remember all that God has done?

258
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Are we woken at night because God wants to talk to us?

259
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Is it the only time we are really still?

260
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Do we allow space for his presence to meet with us during that night watch?

261
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 There have been many times that I've been unable to sleep, and I found myself on my knees,

262
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 sometimes praying, sometimes simply remembering God's faithfulness to me and my family.

263
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Sometimes it's simply in awe of who God is.

264
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I remember one night in the early hours of the morning, I was woken up with a strong urge to pray.

265
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And as I knelt at the end of my bed, I suddenly felt such a strong presence of God in the room.

266
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I was profoundly aware of my own sinfulness and God's holiness.

267
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 It was overwhelming, and yet it gave me a glimpse, a little bit more of who God is.

268
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 God in his holiness, his power, his glory.

269
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And just for a few moments, I was deeply afraid.

270
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But then that flood of reassurance, of knowing that because of Jesus and his blood,

271
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I can enter God's presence, and I do not need to be afraid.

272
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 When we take the time to meditate on what God has done for us in the past,

273
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 when we witness his power at work in the present,

274
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 when we understand his love,

275
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 we are sustained to have the confidence that our future is secure, no matter what it may bring.

276
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 So how do we pursue God to know him?

277
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 We do it by meditating on his love, his goodness for our lives.

278
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 David's confession and meditation led him to a place of satisfaction.

279
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 And that has been true in my life.

280
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I know God. I'm assured of his love. I know that he delivers me.

281
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And David knows that too. He knows he will be delivered.

282
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And the last verses, they appear to be quite a pivot in their tone and focus.

283
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But really, David is concluding with the assurance and knowledge that God will avenge him

284
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 because of God's love and faithfulness.

285
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 David is confident that God will deliver him from his enemies.

286
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 "They who seek my life will be destroyed.

287
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 They will go down to the depths of the earth.

288
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.

289
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 But the king will rejoice in God.

290
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 All who swear by God's name will praise him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced."

291
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Knowing God is our deliverance also brings us to a place of trusting God

292
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 with the things that at times appear too big, too overwhelming.

293
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 But God will have his way.

294
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 There will be his justice.

295
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 There is his chesed, love.

296
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 God wants you to know his presence.

297
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 He wants you to know his love.

298
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 For some of you, you need to choose to trust Jesus.

299
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 It's as simple as that.

300
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 It is not about money.

301
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 It is not about job satisfaction.

302
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It is not about having a relationship or a family that will bring you that satisfaction.

303
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 It is only Jesus.

304
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 For some of us today, we need to desire more to be in his presence and experience his love.

305
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And you know, as I prepared for this sermon and as I was thinking,

306
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 I don't want you to leave here remembering the stories.

307
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 I want you to leave here with a hunger for more of God in your life.

308
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 We may have grown cold or distant.

309
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Some of us will have been Christians for a long time.

310
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Maybe just that busyness of life has kept us,

311
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 or maybe the hope or loss of hope or fears or the anxiety that comes and seems to be overtaking us.

312
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Maybe we've just become too busy with the routine of life that we put it on the list of things to do,

313
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 but we never get around to actually doing it.

314
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 So let's choose to pursue his presence more.

315
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Ask God to meet with you.

316
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Take time to be in his presence so that he can reveal his love to you.

317
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Give him time.

318
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Sit in his presence, and you will come to know his love that truly is better than life.

319
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 So would you join me as we stand?

320
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I would love to pray for us.

321
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Again, as I said, my heart, my prayer is that we leave this place with a hunger to know God.

322
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Our city needs to know God.

323
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 You're a light in this city.

324
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 If you're watching online, wherever you are, we need to hunger for more of God.

325
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 That will take us to a place where we do not feel that we cannot deal with the things that we are dealing with.

326
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 His chesed love will hold us.

327
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 His holiness will transform us.

328
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So as I pray with you, wherever you are at, I pray that you open up your heart

329
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 so that these words don't just be nice words and the stories good, encouraging stories,

330
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 but something is sown in your spirit.

331
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Something takes you deeper, that longing for God, and you leave here so that Monday to Sunday,

332
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 you know the presence of God in your life.

333
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 So Father, I thank you.

334
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 As we enter into your presence now and as we have that opportunity to respond,

335
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I firstly pray for anyone here that does not know Jesus.

336
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I pray that that stirring in their heart right now, the conviction of your spirit,

337
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 will give them the courage and the boldness to take that step of faith.

338
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Take that step of faith to choose to follow Jesus, to choose to make your allegiance with Jesus alone.

339
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 You cannot have Jesus and a multitude of other gods too.

340
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 You must choose allegiance to Jesus alone.

341
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Father, as we pray, and as that person, those people choose you,

342
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 I thank you for your spirit will step to be with them to transform their lives.

343
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And if that is you, then please after the service, come down, talk to me, talk to a pastor, talk to a friend.

344
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Let us pray with you as you journey, continue your journey.

345
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And Father, I lift to you my brothers and sisters in here, and my brothers and sisters online, wherever you may be.

346
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And Father, I pray that you would stir in us a passion to pursue you.

347
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 As David longed for you, even for more than life itself.

348
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I pray for that revelation of your chesed love in this place.

349
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Chesed love for those at home. Chesed love in the city of Hong Kong.

350
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 We need it. Our children need it. Our youth need it.

351
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Chesed love, Father, found in your presence.

352
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Chesed love that allows us to know you more and more.

353
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Chesed love that is transformative.

354
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 So Father, thank you. We will hunger for your presence.

355
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We will choose our allegiance to you. We will confess you as Lord.

356
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And we will spend time to meditate, knowing that you are so faithful, so very faithful.

357
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 And we pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen.

358
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,760
