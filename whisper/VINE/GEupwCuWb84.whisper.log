[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   Yeah, it's great to be with you.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.840]   As you already heard today is Branches of Hope Sunday.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.080]   For those of you who do not know, Branches of Hope was actually started by the Vine Church.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.840]   So this nonprofit organization was started by the Vine.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.940]   And so we're going to hear from them in a little bit excited about that.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.680]   Before we do that, I want to take a little bit time to prepare our hearts through God's
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.240]   word.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.160]   And to hear from God through his word, what is on his heart for justice in society.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.720]   So that we can align our hearts with that.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.040]   Does that sound good?
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.040]   Yes.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.060]   Okay, thank you.
[00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.480]   So last week, we kicked off our God of Justice sermon series.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.680]   And in that series, we are in that message, we looked at the redemptive grand narrative
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.080]   of scripture.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.280]   And we saw that when we look at that narrative, that we can discover God's heart for justice.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.960]   And we also said that it is this narrative that gives us the reason, the motivation and
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.600]   the inspiration to carry out the vision of God's justice that he has for his people.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.260]   And to do that as individuals, but to also do that as a church family together.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.880]   And so when I, as I presented it, that narrative to you, we had some images.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.440]   I want to take you to those images.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.340]   So here you see we were created for good.
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.480]   So God created us, we looked at Genesis.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.160]   There was four relational contexts that we looked at.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.720]   It was about a relation between us and God, us and ourselves, us and others, us and creation.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.960]   And we said that everything was well, there was shalom, there was peace, and these relationships
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.760]   were flourishing and they were thriving.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.480]   But then something happened.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   We said that sin entered the world and there was a breakdown in all those four relationships.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.160]   We decided to rebel against God, and this is repeated by every single human being, even
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.120]   to this point, that we rebel against God.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.140]   There's self-preservation over helping others.
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.340]   So we look out for ourselves first, and this is the default that we find ourselves in right
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.340]   now.
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.160]   And we looked at how these four relationships, how they're broken down, a relationship with
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.320]   God broke down, with ourselves, with others and creation.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.160]   But then we said that God did not leave creation, he did not leave us in this mess, because
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.880]   that was not what he created us for.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:50.160]   And there's a longer story of redemption, but we said that it culminates in Jesus' coming,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.980]   that the righteous died for the unrighteous, for the wicked, for the sinners, which is
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.280]   all of us.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.240]   There's brokenness in our lives where we seek out what is good for us at the cost of other
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:10.120]   people, and we sin against God, we sin against others, and we need Jesus to forgive us, to
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   restore us.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.040]   And so he came, he laid down his life so that we can become the kind of good that he desires
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.360]   for us, that we can become righteous and just people.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.060]   And so this relationship between us and God is restored.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.960]   But then with that, it is not just about us and Jesus.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.240]   That is the most important thing, but it's not just about that.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.640]   Being a Christian, being a person that believes in the gospel, it involves all four dimensions
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.320]   of this relational context, because God wants to restore all of them, and he wants us, his
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320]   people to be part of it.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.000]   So we said that we were sent together to heal, that the church of Jesus has been sent out
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.720]   by Jesus to bring healing into society, into all these facets.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.960]   So let me talk briefly about that.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.760]   We want to see relationships between people and God restored.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.440]   We want to help people find their way back to God.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.240]   We want to see relationships between people themselves restored, their identity, that
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   they have peace even within themselves, which believe that God is the one who gives that.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.440]   We want to see relationship between us and creation restored, because instead of being
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.320]   rulers and having dominion over creation in a way that honors God, that reflects his character,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.840]   we have exploited creation, we have destroyed creation, and God wants us to be good stewards.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.480]   He wants to restore that relationship so that we contribute to its flourishing, to its thriving.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.080]   And then finally, we also are sent out to restore relationships between each other,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.880]   between us and others.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.080]   And that happens on an individual level, like one-on-one, but also on a societal level,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.880]   where we want to see those relationships flourish and thrive.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.400]   We want to address injustices and issues where we make other people's issues our issues,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.920]   because we want them to live out all of God's purposes and not be squished down by society,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.560]   by policies, by whatever else is going on, and so that all people can experience shalom
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.120]   and flourish and thrive.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.440]   And so that's what we are sent out as church to heal.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.400]   God hasn't trusted us with this mission.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.800]   And so this is something that is super important.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.040]   And actually earlier, as Sherry was leading worship, I was thinking about this, that this
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.900]   just happens not because we try harder.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.900]   This is not homework.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.800]   No, you need to try harder.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.720]   This is because the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, moves within our hearts and leads
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.020]   us to love those around us.
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.360]   And so if you're not feeling this right now, our starting point is just to pray, say, "Jesus,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   I'm not feeling this right now.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.960]   Show me what is your will.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960]   Show me how to care.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   Show me how to love.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.520]   Show me what you want to do.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.800]   You move me."
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.560]   And so my prayer for us as a church is that we are this church that does this.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:33.000]   But let me focus on what I want to briefly talk about, and that's the us and others today,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.160]   particularly the injustices in society and God's heart for that.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.200]   And so we're going to go to the book of Isaiah.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.820]   Isaiah is one of the prophets in the Old Testament.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.820]   He confronts his people.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.880]   So I'm going to set the context.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.480]   He confronted his people, God's people, Israel, who were set apart to be righteous and just,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.520]   but they were failing in that.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.040]   So he confronts his people through the prophet, and he speaks into their lives, and he says
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.600]   some things that are quite disturbing.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.760]   And he's God's mouthpiece, so he's saying what God wants to say to his people.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:11.800]   He's saying that he does not take pleasure in their worship.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.960]   Their offerings are meaningless, and he hates it.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.320]   Whoa.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.880]   Can you imagine God saying that to us?
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   What's going on?
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.720]   You know, what's happening here?
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.600]   And that's what we're going to look at.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.640]   We're going to look at the reasons.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.640]   So the first year in Isaiah 1, 15 through 17, it says this, "When you spread out your
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.000]   hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.920]   Even when you offer many prayers, I'm not listening.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.640]   Your hands are full of blood."
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.800]   So we see, again, Israel is in this worship context, and God says, "I don't care about
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   your prayers.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.800]   I'm not listening.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.320]   It doesn't matter how much you pray."
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:01.760]   But the reason is because their lives, their Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   so forth, their lives does not honor God.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.360]   In their day-to-day actions, they're not giving God worship.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.220]   You know, they're living unrighteous lives.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.360]   And so God confronts them, and we're actually even told, we get a hint at what's going on.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.600]   We don't know all the details, but it says, "Your hands are full of blood."
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:31.200]   Now this, of course, can straight up mean murder, that they have blood on their hands,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:38.800]   but it can also entail being indirectly involved in the injustices that are happening in society,
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.640]   that they're just focused on their own life, and they don't care what's going on with their
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.560]   neighbors and with other people.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.320]   And so God implicates them.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.680]   He says, "Your neighbors are also your responsibility.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.560]   It's not just about you and me.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.080]   It's also about you and me and others."
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.800]   And God calls out Israel for not caring for their neighbors, because that is part of what
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.240]   it means to be the people of God, is to be about others, and to care about the issues
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.200]   and the challenges they're facing.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.160]   And the same is true for us.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.640]   As Christians, our responsibility goes beyond looking after ourselves and extends to our
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.640]   neighbors.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.960]   It's not just me and Jesus, and that's it.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.640]   It's me and Jesus, and me and others.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.400]   Jesus cares about that we care about others in society.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.680]   They're also our responsibilities.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.400]   They're our brothers and our sisters, and we should care about what's going on in their
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.880]   lives and what injustices they face, because God cares about them.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.760]   And as His image bearers, He wants us to be people who reflect His image, and who also
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.120]   care about those things that are going on.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.880]   And we also have agency, there's things that we can do.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.560]   Now for most of us, I think the challenge is that, for one, we're just busy, so we don't
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.880]   think about it.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.400]   And then our default is that we take care of ourselves, maybe our family, our friends,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.640]   and we might even not know what's going on.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.960]   You know, what are the injustices and the issues right now in Hong Kong or in other
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   countries?
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.940]   You know, what is going on?
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.880]   But God is saying, "This is our responsibility."
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.400]   And so then there's something that God does in verse 16, so let me continue.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.220]   He calls them, He says, "Wash and make yourself clean.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.200]   Take your evil deeds out of my sight.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.560]   Stop doing wrong."
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.320]   So in other words, He calls them to repent, to turn around, to change their ways, to stop
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.280]   doing what they're doing, to start caring for their neighbors, to start caring about
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.680]   the injustices in society.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.880]   And He calls them to turn around, so repentance always means that there's sorrow, that we
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.920]   realize there's conviction.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.440]   We say, "I'm sorry, God," but it's not just enough to say sorry and then keep doing what
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   you're doing.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.580]   It's actually changing our ways, changing our lives, and living in a different way.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.400]   And so He's saying, "Change the way you live."
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.800]   And then He tells them in verse 17, so we're going to look at that.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.080]   He tells them how He wants them to live.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:20.640]   And He says this, "Learn to do right, seek justice, defend oppressed, take up the cause
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.600]   of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow."
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.560]   And those are actually things that God does, what He's asking His people to do.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:37.000]   He does take up the cause, He does plead, He does defend, and He wants us, His people,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.200]   to do the same thing.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.040]   Two things real quick that stood out to me.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.440]   First, learn to do right.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.920]   We don't actually automatically know what it means to do right.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.760]   It actually takes time to learn and understand what it means to do right in God's eyes.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.080]   That means we need to get to know His word, what God's word says about our neighbors.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.480]   It means we need to understand injustice issues in our society.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.920]   That means we learn from organizations like we're going to do from Branches of Hope.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.280]   It means we learn from people who are experiencing these injustices, that we actually understand
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.960]   them, that we can have compassion, that we can enter into them.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.120]   It means that we also can discern God's will, what His purpose is, and what it means to
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.120]   administer justice.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.680]   And then, of course, we also need to learn how to defend, how to take up, and how to
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.680]   plead.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.680]   How do you do that in Hong Kong?
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   And what does that look like?
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.760]   And the second thing that stood out to me was seek justice.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.560]   So we're not just meant to let the issues come to us.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.120]   We're actually, as the body of Christ, as a church, meant to actively figure out who
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:56.200]   are the oppressed, who are the ones that are marginalized, and what can we do about it.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.760]   And to seek justice also means to discern God's will for this group of people that are
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.800]   facing these situations.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.880]   And then it also means action.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.240]   To seek justice means action.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.800]   It's not just talking beautifully, but it's then actually working out, fleshing out, how
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.120]   do we put things in action?
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.300]   How do we plead their case?
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.480]   How do we help?
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.680]   How do we change?
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:22.900]   How do we contribute to the shalom of society?
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.320]   And so that's what we're going to look at today.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.080]   We're going to hear from Branches of Hope here in a minute.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.380]   Right now, in just a moment, we're going to watch a video from Pastor Tony Reed.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.380]   He's actually with us today.
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.680]   I know he doesn't want attention, but okay, do you mind giving us a little wave?
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   There he is.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.720]   Thank you.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.920]   So for those of you who don't know, Tony is one of the founding pastors of the Vine Church,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:53.400]   and you've seen John a lot, and so he, together with John, they co-pastored.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.700]   And so he's going to share with us about the origin story of how Branches of Hope came
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.700]   to be.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.700]   So let's watch this video.
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.700]   Let's do that now.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:08.360]   I guess when we went into it at first, we were fairly simple in terms of our thinking
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.200]   of what we were trying to do.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:17.380]   As we continued to understand what we were about, we had to provide a much wider range
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:28.120]   of services from financial support and resettlement, doing research, social engagement, empowerment,
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:38.480]   and in fact, a whole range of services that are suitable for marginalized communities.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.640]   Social justice has been part of the church for a long time, right from the beginnings.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:51.600]   But when we were just a small community within the basement of a hotel, meeting on Sundays
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.620]   only with maybe about 80 or 90 people, it was hard for us to put that into practice.
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:04.680]   But several years later, by the time we'd moved into our own premises, we realized that
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.920]   we had perhaps better facilities to offer what we would describe as a 24/7 service.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.440]   And at that time, God provided an opportunity for us.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.480]   Quite amazing.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:25.640]   We had this letter from an asylum seeker who was being detained at the time, and he asked
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.280]   us if we would come and visit him.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.560]   And so, of course, we felt this was the right thing to do to respond well to it.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.320]   And we went to see him.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:41.040]   We went through all the procedures of getting in and understanding how all of that worked.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.240]   And we developed a relationship with him, visited him regularly.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.160]   So when it came for the time for him to be released and others to be released, they asked
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.360]   if they could come to our church.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.560]   And we said, "Yes, of course, we'd be delighted if you came."
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:06.680]   And the ministry of working with the asylum seekers has now grown into the ROAD program,
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:14.600]   which is part of Branches of Hope.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:24.920]   We were asked to host a gala performance of a documentary film produced by another NGO,
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:32.240]   which showed the difficulties and issues of sex trafficking in various parts of the world.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:40.280]   And when we saw this, we were quite astonished because the understanding of what is involved
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:45.800]   in sex trafficking was not generally understood at that time.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:54.000]   We soon began to realize just the trauma and the grooming that went on and just the difficulty
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.720]   that girls had who were brought into and forced to provide services in that area.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:08.920]   And so after we had watched this, we began to ask the question, "What is happening in
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   Hong Kong?
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:17.360]   How is this related to what's going on in Hong Kong?"
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:27.040]   We formed a small movement within the church, I guess it was, of people who were interested
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:37.440]   in trying to work with people who had been subject to trafficking or to exploitation.
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:46.200]   And as a result of that, an organization called Stop Trafficking of People was formed and
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:56.880]   eventually came under the direction and heading of Branches of Hope.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:04.160]   Branches of Hope is the Vine community's investment to the city of Hong Kong.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:11.600]   It is basically our witness to the truth and the vitality of the gospel.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.840]   And so it is important in that sense that we provide something which is a visible evidence
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.640]   of what we believe.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:29.960]   Well I ask the congregation to listen carefully to the work and the experience of Branches
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.280]   of Hope today.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.920]   And as you consider this, to ask the Holy Spirit to guide you and to give generously
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:47.440]   so that this work can continue and that Branches of Hope get the support and the assistance
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.680]   that they need to do the work which is vital to us.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:19:10.400]   You know, I love just hearing the story of how Branches of Hope got started.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   And it's amazing, right?
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.640]   It starts small and then as we pay attention to one individual and then learn about what's
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:22.120]   going on, you know, then we can open our heart to God and what God wants to do.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.720]   But right now I'm super excited to welcome Alex up.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.800]   Let's give him a warm welcome.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.360]   He is the executive director of Branches of Hope.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.960]   He also brought a team, so I also want to say hi to the team.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   Hi team.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   Yes.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.440]   Thank you so much for being here today and also all the volunteers who volunteer with
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.800]   Branches of Hope as well.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.000]   So I have a question for you, Alex.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Where are you from?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.880]   Oh, that's a trick question, isn't it?
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.800]   I am also from Germany as it happens.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.720]   So I guess we can just do this in German now, right?
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   Everybody's cool with that?
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Okay.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.880]   No, so I, yeah, I'm always excited to, you know, see Alex and chat a little German, but
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.320]   we'd love to hear if you can tell us a little bit about Branches of Hope, your involvement
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.560]   with it, you know, what you're doing there, what brought you here today?
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.640]   So well, long story short, what brought me here, but here being Hong Kong, is my lovely
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.720]   wife Jennifer.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:38.680]   She's been in Hong Kong for almost 18 years and she went on a sabbatical in 2014 and well,
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.320]   she basically brought me back.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.360]   So that's how I ended up here.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.040]   I have a career with international humanitarian agencies, the Red Cross, Caritas and so on
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   and so forth.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.080]   So when Jennifer said, well, you know, put her foot down and said, you know, family,
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.880]   marital life, you're coming to Hong Kong, I said, okay.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.040]   And it was actually quite a natural fit to be blessed with the opportunity of joining
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.880]   Branches of Hope.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.040]   My wife has been coming to the Vine Church for a long time, so we were already aware
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.560]   of the great work that the church does and obviously by extension Branches of Hope.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.880]   And when this opportunity came up, I obviously jumped at the chance.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   Yeah, awesome.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.280]   Well, we have a lot of people here who are not that familiar with Branches of Hope.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.440]   So maybe you can tell us about Branches of Hope in a nutshell, give us just a little
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.880]   bit of an overview of what you guys do.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880]   Yeah, sure.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   I'd love to.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:35.320]   I mean, just to expand on what Tony had mentioned in the video, really in a nutshell, Branches
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:41.000]   of Hope was established to be the justice expression of the Vine Church.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.120]   It was basically taking what had been established as a ministry and supercharging it with the
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.080]   possibilities of a nonprofit organization.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.240]   So we have two programs.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:57.160]   We have the Refugee Opportunity and Development Program, which serves, as the name suggests,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.840]   refugees and asylum seekers.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:04.880]   And then we also have the Stop Trafficking of People Program or STOP, which serves those
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.680]   who are experiencing situations of trafficking or also labor exploitation.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.800]   Although these are two very different communities, we have a unified approach the way that we
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.140]   do our work, which we call the three pillars of service.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:24.160]   Those three pillars are care, empowerment, and social change.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.480]   I think care is quite self-explanatory, but I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.600]   But really, for us, the core is empowerment.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.800]   We believe in the self-agency of the people that we work with.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.320]   It's very important for us to make sure that, as our motto suggests, we restore dignity,
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   justice, and hope.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.880]   So giving people that dignity and making sure that they can be seen as a whole person and
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.640]   have the ability to do things independently is very, very close to our heart.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   We do that in a number of different ways.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.960]   But we also realize that a lot of the marginalized group that we do serve, if you're not coming
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.120]   alongside of them to address their material needs, it's very difficult for them to be
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.800]   in a place where they can even consider empowerment and personal development.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.680]   And so that's where care comes in.
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:15.160]   And then last but not least, if we aren't really telling their story, not just seeking
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.040]   them out, but ultimately letting others know of the issues that they're facing, which we
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.400]   do through social change, again, we would not be doing them full justice.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.600]   So that's kind of what we do.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.480]   Our mission is to restore dignity, justice, and hope, so that's where the motto comes
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.000]   from.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.360]   And our vision is that all vulnerable and marginalized individuals and communities in
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:41.920]   Hong Kong will have equal access to resources and opportunities that allow them to realize
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.160]   their dreams and give them a voice in society.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.760]   So in the origin story, you heard that the Vine and at BOH, that there was a relationship.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.960]   Maybe you can tell us a little about that relationship, what that looks like now.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.640]   Yeah, I mean, we're still very, very closely aligned in many respects.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.280]   I mean, just physically, essentially, right?
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.360]   I mean, we share office space with the Vine in Wan Chai and are very, very fortunate to
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.480]   do that.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:17.320]   But even though we're an independent organization, we share the same Christian faith, so ultimately
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:23.160]   we have the same values, we're built on the same DNA, you can say.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.400]   And there's formal and informal ways that that actually is strengthened.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.960]   Normally, we have our own board of directors, but actually half of the directors on our
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.600]   board are current or former elders of the Vine Church.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.160]   So we make sure that in terms of our vision, in terms of our direction, we're very, very
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.520]   closely aligned.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:46.600]   But beyond that, we're extraordinarily fortunate that the Vine continues also to tie to us,
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.520]   which is a major advantage for us compared to other organizations.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.480]   It's some of the things that allows us to be as generous as we are in the services that
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.480]   we provide.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.720]   I'll talk a little bit about our STAR program, for example.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.280]   That's a financial assistance program that's 100% in and 100% out.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.520]   We don't take a cut from that because we have the support from the Vine Church, right?
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   That's really important.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.760]   And then, of course, the congregation.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:15.640]   I mean, the biggest source of support in terms of private donors or volunteers or other people
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.180]   who come and serve alongside us is the congregation.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.360]   So those are all the different levels that we're so closely aligned.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.920]   Thank you for sharing us more about that relationship.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:33.720]   We're also excited for Branches of Hope to get more involved here in Yinhlong.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.420]   And so there's been conversations around that.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.500]   I think later on, we're going to hear a little bit about it as well.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.220]   But right now, you mentioned ROAD and STOP.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.360]   Could you tell us a little bit more about what they are so we can understand?
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.480]   So I think just starting with ROAD, then.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:26:00.760]   So through the ROAD program, we've served several hundred refugees and asylum seekers.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:06.960]   In fact, we have over 1,400 registered with us in the system.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.120]   That represents almost 10% of the overall refugee and asylum-seeking population here
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.440]   in Hong Kong.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.160]   Maybe you're asking yourself, what is a refugee, right?
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.480]   So refugees are people who have fled for one reason or another.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.000]   Could be persecution, could be war, could be other reasons.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.140]   They're a home country and are seeking protection in a third country, right?
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.120]   So that's what brings people to Hong Kong.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.840]   The thing about Hong Kong, though, is it's really important to understand is that if
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.880]   somebody comes to Hong Kong to become an asylum seeker, to become a refugee, they cannot stay
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   in Hong Kong.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:49.160]   Hong Kong is not a signatory to the refugee conventions, which means that even if they
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.920]   become recognized, that their claim is legitimate, that they are recognized as a refugee, eventually
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.000]   they will need to be resettled to a third country.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.560]   There's no integration in Hong Kong, right?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:05.440]   Unfortunately, though, the reality is that the vast majority, over 99%, in fact, are
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   not recognized as refugees and will eventually be returned to their country of origin.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.560]   And that can be a very painful experience because by that time they might have been
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.640]   in Hong Kong for 10, 15, 20 years even.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.480]   Their kids might have been going to school here, et cetera.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   And in that time also, they're not allowed to work.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.880]   They get some modest stipends from the government, but they're not enough.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.200]   And so that's really where the road steps in, right?
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.240]   The road program steps in to bridge those gaps, to make sure that people have the resources
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.760]   that they need to live a dignified life while they're here in Hong Kong.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.880]   We work with them to prepare them for the life after Hong Kong.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.640]   So we've been really working on something what we call durable solutions.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.200]   So this is the idea of helping people, either if they wanted to repatriate themselves to
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.840]   their home country or if they want to figure out ways of moving to a third country, we
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.920]   assist with those.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:07.200]   We have casework, so helping people find referrals to hospitals, find referrals to other services,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.280]   material donations, food.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   We help with figuring out shelter options, all of those things.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.560]   So that's the care side.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:22.120]   Under empowerment, we also do some limited adult education, which is actually where Yunlong
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   comes into play.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.960]   So we've got Jill over there.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.960]   Hi, Jill.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   She's phenomenal.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.840]   She's actually set up a training program here with some of the community members to teach
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.880]   them how to sustain themselves on $40 a day, which is all they have for food.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:44.060]   So you can imagine it's quite challenging to purchase food and cook food on such a budget.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.760]   So those are the things that we do.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.820]   And last but not least, like I said, everything gears towards making sure that when that final
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.600]   step comes in Hong Kong, that they're ready for it.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:00.720]   You know, like as we talked about earlier, this is really a great opportunity to learn
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.560]   about issues that maybe we don't know that much about.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.160]   So thank you so much for sharing that with us.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.800]   Now there is also the STOP program.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.960]   Can you tell us a little bit more about what that's about?
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.200]   Yeah, of course.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.960]   So the STOP trafficking of people program is perhaps a little bit more tricky to wrap
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   your head around, right?
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.960]   I mean, what is even human trafficking?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.680]   It's a form of modern slavery, and that sounds very scary.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.820]   It is very, very scary.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:36.080]   It involves the recruitment, transportation, or receipt of a person by means of force,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.960]   fraud, or coercion for the purpose of exploitation.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.080]   So this is a very formal explanation.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:44.640]   And exploitation, I think, is more easily understood.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.480]   It's the unfair treatment of someone to benefit from their work or position of vulnerability.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:57.360]   Now for STOP, for our understanding, we understand human trafficking to exist on a spectrum,
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.320]   on a scale, right?
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:06.120]   You may have heard in the past, in other contexts, these sort of sensationalized stories of people
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:12.240]   who are kidnapped and brought across the border and then made to work in some sort of labor
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.880]   camp or something like that.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:19.360]   That does exist, but that's not really what we deal with on a nine to five at STOP.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:25.320]   I mean, what we really focus on is more the lower echelons of that, which starts with
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.600]   relatively benign forms of exploitation, right?
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:35.440]   So for example, if you have somebody who comes to Hong Kong as a migrant worker, and they
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.480]   are given a contract to work as a driver, for example, and then they are told, "Oh,
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.680]   but by the way, when you're off duty, you also need to go work in this restaurant,"
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.480]   or "You also need to go work in this construction site, and if you refuse, then we will cancel
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.160]   your visa, we will cancel your contract."
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   That's a form of coercion, right?
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.240]   They're doing something that they didn't come here to do, and whether or not they're paid
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.640]   for it is beside the point.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.400]   The fact that they're being threatened in order to do the work, that's where the exploitation
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   starts.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.200]   That's the beginning of that spectrum of human trafficking.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.240]   And it can get worse, right?
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:14.620]   They can then maybe have their passport withheld or other sorts of abuse in that respect.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:22.900]   And so what we do is we step in when that kind of exploitation helps, takes place.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.160]   So we help people to, first of all, understand what their rights are and how they can seek
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.120]   help if something like this happens to them.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.680]   And to those who are facing those kind of situations, we make sure that they also have
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.680]   the material support that they do.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:43.640]   Oftentimes the help that we provide is the only way that people are even able to access
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.880]   justice to begin with.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:50.640]   You can imagine if somebody's been, let's say for example a migrant domestic worker
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.800]   is scammed, their identity is stolen or they've been duped into doing some illegal act, their
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.840]   employer cancels their contract, and then they've got two weeks technically to find
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.720]   new work.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.200]   If you don't have support in that moment, there's no way that you can address those
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   claims against you.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.000]   There's no way that you can access justice.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.760]   So we make sure that we work together with people to make sure that they know how to
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.800]   do that and that they have the resources to do that.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.480]   And last but not least, I'm also quite proud, the STOP team have really established themselves
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.120]   as a source of information and technical know-how.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.520]   So they do a lot of research actually that informs the work of other organizations that
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.680]   work in the same sector.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.880]   Best practices and policies and things like that.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.200]   So that's kind of what we do with STOP.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.000]   Yeah, so that's amazing work.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.760]   But I think it's also a lot for us to take in, right?
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:51.800]   Learning about road, learning about STOP, justice issues that are happening here in
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.960]   Hong Kong.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:58.720]   So to make it a little bit more tangible, Branches of Hope has prepared a couple of
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   videos for us.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:04.240]   One is from Ali, who's part of the ROAD program, and then there's also Anna, who's part of
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   the STOP program.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   So let's watch that and then let's get back together after that.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.280]   My name is Ali.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.000]   I am from Yemen.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.600]   When I come Hong Kong, I need help for asylum seeker, for some homes.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.400]   How can we live here?
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:40.400]   Difficult government now give enough for rent, for food, everything.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.400]   Not enough.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   This problem.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.360]   And the asylum seeker cannot work.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:51.280]   If I go work, maybe I go jail, catch me police or migration.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.120]   This is problem.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.800]   And I worry for my family.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.680]   I have three baby here.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.520]   Yeah, because this big problem.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.120]   Some friend, he tell me, you can go buy insurance.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.320]   After I go, after.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.640]   Help me.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:15.280]   I give extra money for rent, for something, for school.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:22.640]   Yeah, have class English because we boring in Hong Kong, no work, no.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.560]   I am happy because help me.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.520]   Divine help for some money every month.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:48.200]   We find.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.760]   My name is Anna.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.840]   I'm from the Philippines.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.360]   I came to Hong Kong.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.480]   My first time is 2019.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.040]   I work with my employer for four years and three months.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.920]   I came here through my sister-in-law.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.000]   She helped me to come here.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.640]   I have been involved with criminal exploitation.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.080]   The police came in my employer's house and then arrest me.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:29.040]   Some people, these people, I don't know, they use my name to use it in illegal, criminal
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   what is.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.320]   That's why I'm involved with this case.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:40.600]   Yeah, I lose my job.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:48.200]   I'm so grateful and blessed because I found my where to live because I don't have job.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.600]   I cannot afford to stay in the boarding house.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:36:00.280]   And then after that, my co-shelter introduced me about stock.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:07.600]   I go to the office and then ask for help.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.000]   The basic necessities, they help us.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   They help me.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.360]   And then I also share with my, I can also share some with my co-shelter.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:26.600]   Not only financial, also emotional.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.560]   They are very, very kind.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.800]   They help me a lot.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.040]   That's why I'm in good now.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:48.960]   I always thank God because even though I face this struggle, I'm about to face it because
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:52.360]   the people surround me, especially stock.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:56.800]   I feel, I feel not alone.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.400]   We can always rely on them.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:27.960]   Yeah, it's sobering to learn about those hardships and challenges they face.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:35.400]   Even as somebody who doesn't speak Cantonese and just thinking, how do you even get help
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   and support?
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.840]   So thank you so much for the work that you guys do.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.440]   Maybe you can tell us how can we partner with you?
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.000]   How can we support the work that you're doing?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Yeah, I'd love to.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.240]   Actually, one of the things I'd like to point out just before I get to that is, I wonder
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:58.600]   if you notice that Ali in his sharing, he actually refers to the Vine Church, right?
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.640]   And I think this kind of goes back to the point I was making at the beginning.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:08.960]   A lot of the community members that we serve, they also come to the Vines Fellowship.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.480]   We have a refugee fellowship called Arise on Wednesdays.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.240]   And so we have a lot of crossover between those who are coming for fellowship and those
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.560]   who that we are helping with the services through Branches of Hope.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.920]   And for them, there's no difference, right?
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.760]   It's the same organization.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.480]   It's the Vine Church that's helping.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.800]   And I think it just shows how closely aligned we actually are on those fronts, right?
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:39.640]   But yeah, in terms of how we can work together, honestly, I'd like to highlight four things.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.240]   Prayer is the first.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.800]   Faith in action is the second.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.760]   Being our advocate is the third.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.800]   And fourth is financial support in general.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.960]   Now with prayer, what I'd like to kind of come back to is, again, this idea of the origins
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:04.280]   of Branches of Hope and our identity as a Christian organization, right?
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:10.680]   You know, in Luke chapter 18, verse 2 to 8, Jesus tells his disciples a parable of the
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:17.800]   ungodly judge to make them understand that they should always pray and not give up.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.520]   And in Mark chapter 11, verse 24, it says, "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.680]   prayer, believe that you received it and it will be yours."
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.120]   This is fundamental to what we do.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.260]   We understand that without God, without the Holy Spirit moving among people, supporting
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:37.960]   what we do, providing the resources that we need, there is no moving forward.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:42.880]   And so we always ask for people to pray on our behalf, to pray for the communities that
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:48.200]   we serve, to pray that the resources that we need come through.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.280]   But of course, faith in action is an important one.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.440]   I think James has a lot to say about faith in action as well, but fundamentally, there's
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.960]   lots of opportunities for people to come and volunteer at Branches of Hope as well.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.400]   In fact, we've got a football tournament coming up.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.240]   I'm very sad not to see you play, Tim.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   We're in the tournament, right?
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   I am playing.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   You are playing?
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   I am playing, yeah.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   I take that back.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240]   I might not be good, but I am playing.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.240]   We'll just make sure that you stand in front of the goals.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.360]   I'll just lay in front of the goal and block it.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.040]   But yeah, look, I mean, if you want to do something fun on the 11th of October, please
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.240]   come sign up as a volunteer.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.120]   We've got plenty of things that you can do.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.320]   In general, when we have events, we love having volunteers work with us, but also for other
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   things.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:37.040]   I mean, Jill, again, is a fantastic example of what you can do if you want to serve the
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.040]   community.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.040]   Come talk to us.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.640]   We're very happy to support initiatives of this kind.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.320]   So yeah, faith in action, right?
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.600]   Then being our advocate.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.520]   Today is a really great example of taking a moment, and we're really very, very grateful
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:56.480]   for this opportunity also to speak here, but taking a moment to understand what issues
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.320]   are out there, seeking out, again, what the issues are.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.800]   Because if you know, then you can tell others about it as well.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.120]   You can follow us on social media.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.320]   You can share our social media stuff.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.320]   Sign up for the newsletter.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.760]   Continue to educate yourself about what's going on and tell others about it.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.440]   If you work for a company, if you work at a school, invite us to come and talk to students,
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440]   to colleagues.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.340]   We love doing that kind of stuff as well, just to be able to get more people to know
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.480]   about what's going on.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   And then of course, financial support.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.920]   I mean, obviously, we cannot keep going.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.280]   We cannot keep doing what we do.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:38.280]   We cannot keep the lights on without the support of individuals like yourselves to make sure
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.400]   that we can keep doing what we do.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:47.200]   We're actually just in the process of launching a new financial assistance program in 2025
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.360]   called the STAR program.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.300]   This is essentially superseding a previous program.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.960]   Some of you may even know Secret Angel program, if you're familiar with that.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.720]   But basically, we provide monthly allowances to the community members.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.120]   And this is what I meant before, right?
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.880]   It's 100% in and out.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.400]   So you can sign up for that.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:13.120]   There's other ways that you can also support our programs, whether it's making a monthly
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.920]   donation or a one-off donation.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.360]   So there's all of that kind of stuff as well.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.440]   And please do come say hello to my wonderful colleagues over there afterwards.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.840]   We've also got some very cool merch.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.320]   I mean, if anybody likes the socks.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   Nice.
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.760]   So yeah, please do come and check it out.
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:35.320]   I just bought them before and put them on.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:39.480]   But I hope it's all going to be good because I didn't wash them.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.300]   I like them.
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.360]   So we heard basically four things that we can do, right?
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.080]   We can pray.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:53.280]   And as we've been sharing, prayer really opens us up to the work of the Holy Spirit and God
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   works through prayers.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.780]   So we can pray for branches of hope.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.640]   We can put our faith in action.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:05.560]   We can volunteer and seek out opportunities to serve with branches of hope.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:10.200]   We also can support the STAR program or donate.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.680]   And I feel like I'm forgetting one.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.680]   Those are all four.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.320]   Prayer, faith in action, education.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.320]   Education advocating.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   That was it.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:25.160]   And it's interesting with that because when I've brought up talking about human trafficking
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.800]   to others in Hong Kong, a lot of times there's a response, "No, there is no such thing here."
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.160]   And so there really is a chance to advocate and to educate as well.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.200]   That's super powerful.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.000]   So is there anything else that you would like to share with us?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.800]   I guess, like you said, we've covered a lot of ground today.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.440]   I'd like to come back again to sort of like the fundamentals a little bit, right?
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:54.400]   And to talk a little bit about our motto, dignity, justice, hope.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.720]   And how those relate specifically to the three pillars of service that I mentioned, right?
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.080]   So we've got care, empowerment, and social change.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:07.120]   Care restores hope.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.880]   When we care for somebody, we give them hope.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.720]   Hope is when we have friends around us.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.040]   Empowerment restores dignity.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.640]   When people are empowered, they are encouraged to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.120]   Again, this self-agency of the people that we serve.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.720]   And that restores their dignity.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.900]   It allows them to care for themselves instead of depending on a handout.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.400]   And the restoration of dignity comes when we work together and support each other.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:37.060]   And then last but not least, social change restores justice.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:42.200]   When our society is reformed to protect the marginalized, we actually restore justice.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.400]   And this is kind of what you were saying in your message earlier as well, right?
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.720]   Like we, as Christians, we're called to seek it out, right?
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.480]   We're supposed to make this world a better place, right?
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.200]   And so social change is what restores justice.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.080]   And I think, you know, apart from us being very grateful for being here, it's also an
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:05.640]   invitation to all of you to be part of that process so that we can together restore dignity,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.000]   justice, and hope.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   I love this.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.160]   Thank you so much, Alex, for being here.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   Let's give Alex some thanks.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.160]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.640]   Thanks.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.720]   I would love to actually invite you all to stand.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.640]   And I also want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.320]   And we heard today, you know, these ways that we can respond to what has been shared.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.720]   We actually took some time to learn about injustices that are happening in our city
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:45.200]   and how we can just love and support and make other people's challenges our challenges,
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.460]   other people's issues our issue, right?
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.640]   And I would love for every one of us to think of one thing, you know, one of these four
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.560]   things that they shared that we can do, right?
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.340]   Because our faith is about action.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:45:59.480]   If you want to pray, pray.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:04.120]   If you want to advocate and share about how you can help, do that.
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.840]   If you want to put faith and action through serving, you know, do that.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:11.640]   And if you want to give financially, support them in their work to do, let's do that.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.760]   Let me pray for us.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:22.280]   Jesus, we thank you that, yeah, you came and you died and rose so that we can be different
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:30.480]   people, that we can be people who love you but also love our neighbors and who care about
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.720]   those who are suffering, those who are experiencing injustices and that you have sent us out to
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:43.180]   heal and advocate and to speak up for and to provide and to care for those in need.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.600]   But we also know that it's you moving through your spirit.
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.400]   So Holy Spirit, I just pray that you will move in our church, that you help us to be
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:57.440]   a church that does justice here in the city, that seeks it out and learns to do right.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.580]   And will you guide us in that?
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.040]   So I pray all this in your name, Jesus.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.540]   Amen.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:12.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
