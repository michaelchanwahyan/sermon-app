1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 - Amen, amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 Can we thank our worship team as always?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,760
 (congregation applauding)

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,600
 So blessed.

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,680
 Have a seat, have a seat.

6
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,880
 Welcome to the Vine.

7
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,680
 Welcome if you're joining us online right now

8
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,800
 from wherever you are around the world.

9
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,560
 We are so glad that you are here present with us

10
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,240
 in this place and in this moment.

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,960
 And we're grateful for each one of you.

12
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,080
 Jump on the chat if you can, and Facebook particularly,

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,520
 and just let us know where you're from, what you're doing.

14
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,360
 Well, hopefully what you're doing

15
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,480
 is joining us in the service,

16
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,480
 but you can tell us where you're from, that'd be great.

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,160
 And welcome to everyone in this room.

18
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
 It's so great to have you guys with us.

19
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,920
 If you're new to the Vine,

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
 if this is a relatively new experience for you,

21
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,040
 my name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors.

22
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,040
 Maybe you've been invited here by a friend

23
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,120
 who's dragged you along.

24
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,880
 Maybe you were supposed to go to the Baptist church

25
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,080
 next door, but you're here.

26
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,440
 That's great.

27
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,880
 We're so glad you are.

28
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,280
 We're starting a new series today,

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,440
 a short little four-week punchy series

30
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,160
 called "From the Heart."

31
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,160
 And there was something that was on my heart

32
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,720
 as we came out of our "A Different Spirit" series,

33
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,320
 which was a seven-week series we've just finished

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,600
 on Numbers 13 and 14.

35
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
 It's all online, you can jump on

36
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,840
 and take a look at that if you're new with us.

37
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,400
 But we just did this big series looking at

38
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,960
 what it is to carry a different spirit in Hong Kong

39
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,600
 in this season, in this hour,

40
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
 what the Holy Spirit might be saying to us as individuals,

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,160
 as church in the city today.

42
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,520
 And that was great.

43
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,360
 And we got to the end of that,

44
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,000
 and I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
 if we could just hear from some of the senior leaders

46
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,920
 in our church, those that have been leaders in the past,

47
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,680
 historically with us, some of those that are leaders

48
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,160
 with us right in this moment,

49
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,000
 and ask them a simple question.

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,560
 What is on your heart for the vine in this moment,

51
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,240
 in this season?

52
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,400
 I said to each one of them,

53
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,600
 how would you bring expression to this idea

54
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,440
 of a different spirit?

55
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,240
 What do you think a different spirit means

56
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,760
 for the vine in this time, in this hour?

57
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,920
 And so this series really is just a series of people

58
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
 that are gonna come and do that and bring their hearts.

59
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,280
 You'll see here the rundown.

60
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,600
 I'm gonna speak to you guys today.

61
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,640
 We got Tony Reid coming on the 27th of June,

62
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,280
 just after World Refugee Day next Sunday.

63
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,640
 Then Tony will be with us, one of our founding pastors here.

64
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,880
 Sydney Yip, chairman of our eldership

65
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
 who's sitting over here right now.

66
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,040
 Sydney's gonna come and bring a message on the 4th of July,

67
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,680
 and on the 11th of July, we'll finish with John,

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
 John Snellgrove, one of our founding pastors as well.

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,840
 And I know that these men are gonna bring something

70
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
 in their spirit for you,

71
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
 and I wanna encourage you right at the start,

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
 just to open yourself up, like we were just seeing.

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
 I am open.

74
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
 Are we really open to hear

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
 what the Spirit is saying to the church?

76
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,600
 And I think over these weeks in this series,

77
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,560
 we're gonna hear a little bit about that.

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,440
 And I'm excited I get to kick it off today

79
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,800
 and share with you a message that really has been formating

80
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,880
 and kind of bubbling away on my spirit for about a year now.

81
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,720
 And I've been wondering,

82
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,680
 when am I gonna be able to bring it?

83
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
 When am I gonna be able to say it?

84
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,440
 When is the timing right?

85
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,640
 And I think this series is the perfect time for it.

86
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,240
 It's a pastoral word for you.

87
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,480
 I hope it's an encouraging, inspiring word,

88
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,800
 a challenging word perhaps,

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,880
 but something that I believe will help shape

90
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,360
 and grow your relationship with Jesus in this moment.

91
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,120
 Because we've been saying throughout the last

92
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,440
 sort of eight weeks, nine weeks

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,560
 that we've been reopened as a church,

94
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,120
 we've been saying that it's our time to lean in

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
 to what the Holy Spirit is doing in our lives,

96
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,200
 together, personally,

97
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,840
 as we see what God wants to do in our city.

98
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,440
 And I think this and what I wanna share today

99
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,520
 is part of that process for you.

100
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,200
 Let me start by just asking us a simple question.

101
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,600
 It's this, have you ever been frustrated

102
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,560
 that God doesn't seem to be moving fast enough in your life?

103
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,120
 You ever been frustrated by that?

104
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
 Like, it seems like God's on a different timetable

105
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
 to your timetable.

106
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
 Like, God hasn't come through with that healing

107
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
 or that answered prayer,

108
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,000
 or he hasn't spoken to you as quickly as you think he should

109
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,040
 or as quickly as would be right for you.

110
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,760
 Anyone felt that way?

111
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,960
 Have you ever felt like you're in Causeway Bay

112
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,720
 on a Saturday and it's packed full of people?

113
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,080
 And like you're walking there

114
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,720
 and you're trying to get from A to B

115
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
 and you've got a destination to get to,

116
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,920
 but it's so packed, you can't move around much.

117
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,040
 And the person standing and walking right in front of you

118
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,520
 is the slowest walking person in Hong Kong.

119
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,120
 Have you ever experienced that?

120
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,800
 Like, and you know, you're just like, this is ridiculous.

121
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,040
 Why does this person have no purpose in life?

122
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,120
 Like, don't they have somewhere to go, something to do?

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,400
 And you wanted to slap them on the back of the head,

124
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,880
 you know, walk faster.

125
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
 You know, this is Causeway Bay, come on.

126
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,920
 We follow Jesus, don't we?

127
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,080
 And sometimes it feels a little bit like Jesus

128
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,200
 is in front of us and we wanna kind of slap him

129
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
 on the back of the head.

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,440
 Like, come on, Jesus.

131
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,160
 It's time that you move a bit quicker.

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,120
 You know, we got a purpose here, we're doing something.

133
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,920
 You've spoken some dreams into my heart.

134
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,320
 You've got a word for me.

135
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,240
 I know there are big things in my life that you wanna do.

136
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,280
 And it seems like we're at a red light.

137
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,520
 What are you doing, Jesus?

138
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,800
 Israel, in their history with God,

139
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
 felt like this so many times.

140
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,880
 The Old Testament is filled with stories

141
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,720
 where Israel is wondering why God is so slow.

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,600
 There's a great moment right at the end of the Old Testament

143
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,160
 where Israel has been for 70 years in captivity,

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,880
 in exile in Babylon.

145
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,680
 70 years beforehand, Babylon had stormed into Jerusalem,

146
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,280
 the Holy Sacred City.

147
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,000
 And they had destroyed the walls, pulled them down,

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,560
 rushed into the city and killed

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
 many of the Israelites there.

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
 And the significant thing they did

151
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,320
 was they destroyed the temple.

152
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,760
 They literally raised the temple down to the ground

153
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,080
 so that it was not a beautiful, glorious building anymore,

154
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,680
 but rubble on the ground.

155
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,960
 And this act threw the whole of Israel

156
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,120
 into an existential and theological crisis.

157
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,000
 Because Israel were like, "Well, hang on a sec.

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,600
 "The temple was the house of God.

159
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,760
 "It was the presence of God on earth.

160
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,040
 "It was where God dwelt.

161
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,600
 "And when He dwelt with us,

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
 "that was where our comfort was, our security was,

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
 "where our life was.

164
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,480
 "The temple was the symbol to Israel

165
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,040
 "that God was for them.

166
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,960
 "And if God was for them, who can be against them?"

167
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,360
 And yet, these Babylonians, these Gentiles,

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
 these foreigners had come in

169
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
 and they had destroyed the house of God.

170
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,440
 And so whilst they're in exile in Babylon for 70 years,

171
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,200
 they're in this theological crisis

172
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,720
 and they're wondering, "Where are you, God?

173
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,640
 "What have you done?

174
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,000
 "Why have you gone away from us?

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,560
 "Why have you given up on us?"

176
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,960
 Many of the Psalms in the book of the Psalms

177
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,800
 were written during that 70-year process.

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,540
 That's why those Psalms are like, "Where are you, God?

179
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,240
 "My enemies are against me, but I will trust in you."

180
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,800
 At the end of the 70 years, something amazing happens.

181
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,600
 Persia comes in and invades Babylon.

182
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,900
 And Persia by then is a big, huge empire

183
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,200
 and they take over Babylon.

184
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,320
 And they basically discover that there's all these Israelites

185
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,360
 that are there in exile, away from their home.

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,400
 And the Persians allow the Israelites

187
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,840
 to return back to Jerusalem.

188
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,340
 And they return back in three waves.

189
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,740
 The first wave is on the leadership

190
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,040
 of a man named Zerubbabel.

191
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,920
 And Zerubbabel was given one task and one task only.

192
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
 He is told by God to go back

193
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,920
 with the first group of Israelites back to Jerusalem

194
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,500
 and begin to rebuild the temple.

195
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,680
 Begin to get the temple back up into its former glory.

196
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,200
 And you can understand why this is top of the list for Israel

197
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,680
 because they've realized that the destruction of that temple

198
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,880
 threw them into crisis.

199
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,320
 As they go back to Jerusalem,

200
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,320
 they wanna establish the temple, establish God's presence,

201
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,080
 and get God to be active with them

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,340
 to get that place of safety and security.

203
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,060
 So Zerubbabel with the first wave of Israelites

204
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,400
 goes back to start the temple.

205
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,980
 A little bit later, the second wave comes in.

206
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,160
 And the second wave, you can imagine,

207
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,980
 are so excited to see the temple.

208
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,080
 They're excited because they were not the generation

209
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,740
 that saw the original temple.

210
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,540
 70 years has passed and a lot of the people

211
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,860
 that laid eyes on the original temple

212
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,500
 have now died and passed away.

213
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,580
 But the new group who have heard about the glory

214
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,520
 and the beauty and the majesty of the temple in Jerusalem,

215
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,900
 they're so excited that they get back,

216
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,940
 they're gonna expect to see

217
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,360
 this beautiful temple restored in Jerusalem.

218
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
 And the book of Zechariah, the prophet Zechariah,

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,820
 is there in those moments.

220
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,180
 And chapter four, actually, of Zechariah

221
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,340
 captures for us this moment where they return

222
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,300
 and they cast their eyes

223
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,500
 on what they were expecting to be this finished product,

224
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,820
 this beautiful temple,

225
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,060
 but was actually still at that time only rubble.

226
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,900
 And here's what they say.

227
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,100
 This is from Zechariah four,

228
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,020
 I'm reading in the Good News translation.

229
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,380
 They are disappointed

230
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,620
 because so little progress is being made.

231
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,880
 Anyone here disappointed?

232
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,020
 Because it feels like for you

233
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,880
 so little progress is being made in your life

234
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,140
 or in your faith or in your relationship with God

235
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,700
 or in the things that you want, in the city of Hong Kong.

236
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,780
 It feels like there's so little progress

237
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,940
 and you're frustrated and disappointed.

238
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,140
 Here's the Israelites, they come back

239
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,740
 and they only see rubble

240
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,480
 when they're expecting to see the grandness,

241
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,420
 the beauty and the bigness of the temple.

242
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,780
 And they're disappointed, they're frustrated,

243
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,100
 and they're beginning to wonder again,

244
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,500
 where is God in this?

245
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,740
 Because if God was in it,

246
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,260
 surely there'd be this glorious big temple.

247
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,880
 And we've got just rubble.

248
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,260
 I love this reaction from the Israelites

249
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,980
 'cause I think it peers a little bit

250
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,640
 into every human soul.

251
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,700
 'Cause here's the reality for us as humans.

252
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,340
 We love the finished product,

253
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,400
 but we're not so crazy about the unfinished process.

254
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,460
 Are you with me?

255
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,860
 Like we love the idea of the finished product.

256
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
 We want things to be nicely finished

257
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,060
 and completed and established

258
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,820
 with a beautiful little bow on top,

259
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,480
 but we're not so excited about the hard work,

260
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,980
 the step-by-step, faithful little things

261
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,980
 that need to be done to get us from where we are right now

262
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,900
 to where we're gonna go.

263
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,620
 No, we want God to wave his magic wand,

264
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,020
 instantaneously give us this temple.

265
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,860
 And when we show up and we realize

266
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,340
 there's still a long journey to go,

267
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,700
 we get disappointed because we think

268
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,180
 that God is never in the unfinished process.

269
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,780
 We think God is just in the glorious temple.

270
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:27,900
 When God so often moves more powerfully,

271
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,580
 in the small things than in the dramatic and the big.

272
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:39,980
 In fact, God always goes from the small things

273
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,760
 to the big things because he wants to take you along

274
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,600
 with him.

275
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,140
 Because if God didn't do that,

276
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,560
 chances are you would be lost in the middle

277
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,940
 of everything that he is doing.

278
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,340
 But actually when we realize that God is with us

279
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,700
 in the small, step-by-step, daily faithfulness

280
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,820
 that we have that doesn't seem grand, doesn't seem big,

281
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,460
 feels like we're walking way slower than we should be,

282
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,780
 but that process is the way that God actually moves us

283
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,540
 from the small to the big, but doesn't lose us in between.

284
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,700
 It's like, if everything God ever did was the big finish,

285
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,420
 there would be no small changes in us.

286
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,740
 I mean, imagine with me for a moment, church,

287
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,040
 if God suddenly came through and did the grand

288
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,380
 and the big in your life.

289
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,540
 Imagine if all of the dreams that you're holding

290
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,460
 on your heart right now, all the things that you want,

291
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,300
 imagine if God did those instantaneously for you.

292
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,340
 Like instantly you were successful,

293
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,340
 instantly famous, instantly wealthy,

294
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,220
 instantly having the marriage that you longed for,

295
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,580
 instantly with the perfect body.

296
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,140
 Are you with me?

297
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,340
 Like imagine if God did the instantly,

298
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,580
 and we have this weird perception as Christians

299
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,820
 that we understand in the human life, things take time,

300
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,620
 but with God, we think it needs to be instant.

301
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,300
 But you need to realize that if you have

302
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,180
 the instantaneous things of God,

303
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,540
 here's two things that are gonna color your life,

304
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,120
 two things that are gonna be a problem for you.

305
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,780
 Number one, God is gonna become even more

306
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,020
 of a Santa Claus for you than he already is.

307
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,720
 He's gonna be your little genie in that bottle

308
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,640
 that you can just rub, rub, rub, rub, rub every time,

309
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,140
 and boom, he gives it to you.

310
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,120
 But the second thing is even more important than that.

311
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,060
 God understands that if he always did the instantaneous,

312
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,800
 always did the big thing in your life

313
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,620
 without taking you through the small things

314
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,220
 to get you there, he understands that if you got

315
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,900
 those big things, you would be incapable

316
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,140
 of holding onto them.

317
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,140
 Incapable of keeping a hold of that success.

318
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,280
 Incapable of actually holding onto that marriage

319
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,340
 that you had been longing and dreaming for.

320
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,960
 Incapable when the first obstacles come

321
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,040
 that to letting actually go of that thing

322
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,920
 because you haven't experienced the process

323
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,040
 of how God was forming a character, an integrity,

324
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,060
 and a strength of resolve, and a steadfastness,

325
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,100
 and a resolve in you to get you to the point

326
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,360
 where when the big happened, you could stand up

327
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,120
 with character, with integrity, and hold on

328
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,140
 to the big things 'cause the big things

329
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,660
 have big responsibility.

330
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,480
 And God, for some of you in your life,

331
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,240
 you're super frustrated at God because you expected

332
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,360
 to be further along.

333
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,400
 You are disappointed that there's just rubble

334
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,800
 and there's not a temple.

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,680
 And God is looking upon you and he's saying,

336
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,640
 do you wanna know where my anointing is right now?

337
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,380
 It's actually in the small, almost imperceptible

338
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,360
 little things that I'm chipping away at,

339
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,120
 that I'm doing, that I'm processing in your life

340
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,820
 to get you to the point that when that great thing

341
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,000
 does happen, you're gonna walk into it

342
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 with flourishing in life and not be stripped away

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,140
 by all of this.

344
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,280
 It's fascinating to me that we want the big things

345
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,120
 from God, but we don't want God to start the small way.

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
 Are you with me?

347
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,820
 This week marked the one year anniversary

348
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,260
 of me working out and eating healthy.

349
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 One year, I turned COVID into the best year of my life.

350
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,680
 And I can stand before you today at 46,

351
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,440
 I just told you how old I was, we'll delete that later.

352
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,880
 I can stand before you today at 46 and say,

353
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,060
 I'm in the best shape of my life.

354
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,080
 But I've got a long way to go.

355
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,520
 Don't let these incredible arms fool you.

356
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,840
 I've got a long, long way to go.

357
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,560
 But I know that I am able to lift weights today

358
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,120
 that would have been impossible for me to lift a year ago.

359
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,640
 In fact, if I had tried to lift those weights a year ago,

360
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,760
 I would have caused great injury to myself.

361
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,660
 Some of you want something for God so bad

362
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,360
 that if he gave it to you, it would actually cause you

363
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,520
 more injury than life.

364
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,820
 And that there actually is a process by which

365
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,160
 the daily, daily, for me, three times a week,

366
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,480
 faithfully of my workout trainer,

367
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,240
 to try to get some muscle, try to build some things,

368
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,700
 take it small, I mean, the weights,

369
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,400
 if you saw photos of the weights that I started with,

370
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,300
 you'd be like, that guy's such a dweeb.

371
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,700
 Even today, you might still think that.

372
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,300
 But today I can lift weights way more

373
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,180
 than I could ever done before.

374
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,020
 Why?

375
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,940
 Because there's been a step-by-step faithfulness

376
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,560
 and some of you are in the training ground,

377
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,360
 but you wanna be at the finish line.

378
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,400
 Is this speaking to anyone?

379
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,960
 And I wanna unpack this idea by taking a look

380
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,940
 at the broader context to what I think God is saying

381
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,000
 through Zachariah to Zerubbabel.

382
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,980
 Can you imagine how it would have felt for Zerubbabel,

383
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,180
 the second wave come back and he's like,

384
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,100
 here's the foundation stones.

385
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,680
 And everybody's like, where's the temple?

386
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,140
 And Zerubbabel's like, well, we've cleared a little ground

387
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,900
 and there's a few rocks kind of in place.

388
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,740
 And God comes and speaks into Zerubbabel's spirit

389
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,940
 and I think he's gonna speak into some of your spirits

390
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,620
 this morning, let me read this to us from verse six.

391
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,420
 So he said to me, this is the word of the Lord

392
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,780
 to Zerubbabel, not by might nor by power,

393
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,500
 but by my spirit, says the Lord Almighty.

394
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,420
 What are you, O mighty mountain?

395
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,820
 Before Zerubbabel, you will become level ground.

396
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,860
 Then he will bring out the cornerstone,

397
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,460
 the capstone to shouts of God bless it, God bless it.

398
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,940
 Then the word of the Lord came to me,

399
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,080
 the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations

400
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,060
 of this temple, his hands will also complete it.

401
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,460
 Then you will know that the Lord Almighty

402
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,900
 has sent me to you.

403
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,780
 Who despises the day of small things?

404
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,060
 Let me speak that over you and your spirit right now.

405
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,060
 Who despises the day of the small things?

406
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,420
 In fact, I think that's a word for us in our city right now.

407
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,800
 I wanna declare that today is the day

408
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,380
 of small things over Hong Kong.

409
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,260
 'Cause I don't know about you,

410
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,820
 but I have big hopes and dreams for our city.

411
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,460
 There are some big things that we feel we need God to do

412
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,900
 in this time and in this hour

413
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,100
 of Hong Kong's important history.

414
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,820
 I mean, there's some big work to be done for the gospel.

415
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,180
 Still something like 10% of people in Hong Kong know Jesus.

416
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,380
 90% of the people do not know him.

417
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
 We have a lot of work to do.

418
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,340
 There are some big dreams that should be sitting

419
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,020
 on our hearts, big things that are pulling us forward.

420
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,820
 I mean, believing that we're gonna become a river

421
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
 and not just a house,

422
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,700
 believing we're gonna see reconciliation and healing

423
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,260
 like we've never seen before.

424
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,380
 Believing that Hong Kong can find a new identity

425
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,340
 and find itself being stabilized,

426
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,260
 maybe reconciliation taking place, whatever it might be.

427
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,900
 I mean, big things that only God can do.

428
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
 And the danger for us as the church in this city right now

429
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,140
 is that we are wanting the instantaneous big thing

430
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,780
 without the actual small, faithful, step-by-step day

431
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,860
 of small things that's gonna get us from A to B

432
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,620
 in the way that we can then hold on to B when it comes.

433
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,180
 You're with me.

434
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,820
 And I feel like God is opening up this opportunity for us,

435
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,420
 this different spirit in us,

436
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,700
 that we would no longer despise the day of the small thing.

437
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,180
 And it's not just for the city,

438
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,420
 but it's also for you personally.

439
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,300
 It's for each one of you in this room.

440
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,340
 What is it that you're currently holding

441
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,260
 that you're really frustrated

442
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,300
 because it doesn't feel like God's coming through

443
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,860
 in that timing that you were hoping?

444
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,140
 What is the thing that's kind of sitting in your hands

445
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,700
 that doesn't seem like much

446
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,220
 when you had so much of a dream on your heart?

447
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,500
 I wonder how many of us in this room

448
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,660
 are wondering when God's gonna show up,

449
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,740
 when God's gonna complete it,

450
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,980
 when God's gonna actually move.

451
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,340
 I think there's two times in life

452
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,460
 where we often ask that question.

453
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,140
 One is during travel, and one is when we're cooking.

454
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,980
 Have you ever been on a road trip with some friends

455
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,020
 or with your family, with kids, right,

456
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,140
 and you're driving around,

457
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,580
 and what's the first question that comes

458
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,460
 as soon as you've left your house?

459
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,580
 Are we there yet?

460
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,420
 We literally just left the house, you know?

461
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,860
 Or maybe the Hong Kong version of this,

462
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,060
 like we're sitting on an airplane.

463
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,900
 Remember airplanes?

464
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,620
 They're the things that fly in the sky, right?

465
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,780
 (audience laughing)

466
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,220
 We're sitting on an airplane,

467
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,380
 and we've got our kids next to us on the seat,

468
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,860
 and we're heading to the UK,

469
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,580
 11-hour, 12-hour flight,

470
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,620
 and hour one, the kids are like, "Are we there yet?"

471
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,300
 Like we literally just left the airport one hour ago.

472
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,580
 We got 10 more of these hours until we get there, right?

473
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,680
 Or what about cooking?

474
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,260
 I, yeah, man, I work hard on Sundays.

475
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,540
 I just want you to know.

476
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,720
 My wife's not at this service.

477
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,840
 She was at the previous service,

478
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,140
 but I can really open it up today,

479
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,660
 now that she's not at this service,

480
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,060
 but I work really hard.

481
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,180
 Four services, preach my gut out.

482
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,260
 I literally like get home, I open.

483
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,520
 Now, Sunday is the only day in the week

484
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,540
 when our amazing domestic helper, Lizelle, is not with us,

485
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,060
 and we, you know, it's awesome, bless her day off.

486
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,740
 We hate it, though, 'cause we have to cook, right?

487
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,020
 Like, and Chris and I are, sorry, honey,

488
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,540
 really bad cooks, we're really bad cooks, right?

489
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,540
 So I've just done this crazy day, I'm super tired.

490
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,220
 I literally like open the front door.

491
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,940
 I collapse into the apartment, right?

492
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,260
 And there, our kitchen's right there in the front door,

493
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,260
 and I peer my head around, and there's Chris over the stove,

494
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,100
 and I'm like, "Is it ready yet?"

495
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:23,380
 This is when we have a domestic discussion every Sunday.

496
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,500
 And my wife will often say, "I literally just put it on.

497
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,380
 "You just walked in the house, right?

498
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,540
 "Like, go and wash your hands,

499
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,100
 "and have a shower, and do whatever."

500
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,860
 Like, I'm just, or I'll say, "Is it ready yet?"

501
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,380
 She's like, "Yeah, it is, if you like it raw."

502
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,820
 (congregation laughing)

503
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
 "Would you like it raw, 'cause it's..."

504
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,100
 And some of you in this room,

505
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,140
 that's the way you treat God,

506
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,900
 that's the way you have a relationship with God.

507
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,980
 You're expecting God to always be instantaneous

508
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,260
 in your life, and you've been waiting, maybe,

509
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,420
 for a period of time, and you're coming into the house,

510
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,960
 and you're going, "God, is it ready yet?

511
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,900
 "Because I'm ready, is it ready yet?"

512
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,660
 And God's saying, "No, yeah, it is ready,

513
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,000
 "if you like it raw, like, if you like it

514
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,580
 "the way it is right now, but if you wanna be a sweet taste,

515
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,980
 "if you wanna be a delicacy, if you wanna be the person

516
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,760
 "that I'm forming and shaping in you,

517
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,540
 "you're not quite ready yet to be released

518
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,780
 "for what it is that I'm about to do.

519
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,780
 "It will crush you, the weight of it.

520
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,140
 "I got some more work to do in you.

521
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,420
 "Will you be faithful to the day of the small thing,

522
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,980
 "to the thing that I'm doing in your life,

523
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,260
 "right here, right now, just,

524
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,740
 "that seems almost imperceptible?"

525
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:30,260
 You want the grand, but my presence is here in the small.

526
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:36,500
 And it's interesting, 'cause Zerubbabel gets this

527
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 in verse six, this is what the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel,

528
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,380
 "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,"

529
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,020
 says the Lord.

530
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,260
 See, I love this, 'cause God wants to help Zerubbabel

531
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,480
 to understand that the project that he's called him to do,

532
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,580
 to rebuild the temple, is way beyond his ability,

533
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,420
 that that temple building thing, that massive thing,

534
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,060
 is so big that it can only sit in God's hands,

535
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,260
 it cannot sit in Zerubbabel's hands.

536
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,700
 The dream that God has for Zerubbabel is so big on purpose

537
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,980
 so that Zerubbabel doesn't think that his might

538
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,500
 or his power can accomplish it.

539
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,380
 Some of you are frustrated in this room,

540
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,940
 and you're using all of your strength, all of your power,

541
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,140
 all of your might, to try to bring about the things of God

542
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,500
 that can only be brought about by his spirit.

543
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,540
 And he designs the big things in your life to be so big

544
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,820
 that your power and your might cannot get there.

545
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,900
 And we despise the small things

546
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,860
 because we think that the small things

547
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,980
 could never add up to the big thing.

548
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,980
 And God's saying, "My math is a little different to yours,

549
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,180
 "'cause it's not your might nor your power,

550
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,260
 "but it will be my spirit," says the Lord.

551
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,980
 Notice this in the second half of verse seven.

552
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,420
 "Then Zerubbabel will bring out the capstone

553
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,420
 "the cornerstone to shouts of, 'God bless it, God bless it.'"

554
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,780
 This is God saying,

555
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,260
 "This is how my temple is going to be built."

556
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,580
 That massive big thing that you can't do

557
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,020
 in your power and your might.

558
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,500
 It's going to be built this way.

559
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,580
 Zerubbabel is going to bring out

560
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,780
 before all of the disgruntled, all of the despising,

561
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,260
 all of the people that are disappointed

562
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,220
 with the progress that's being made,

563
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,060
 he's gonna bring out the one piece, the cornerstone,

564
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,580
 the capstone, the first stone to be laid.

565
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,180
 And all of you disgruntled people,

566
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,540
 here's what I want you to do.

567
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,180
 I want you to shout, "God bless it, God bless it."

568
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,020
 Why?

569
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,140
 Because in doing that,

570
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,820
 you're saying something prophetically.

571
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,820
 You're saying it's not by our power, it's not by our might,

572
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,780
 it's by the spirit that's gonna build this temple.

573
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,540
 Like this cornerstone doesn't have the strength in itself

574
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,420
 to hold up the whole of the building.

575
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,460
 But if we pray that God will bless it,

576
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,580
 even the small stone will be the beginning

577
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,340
 of the big project.

578
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,260
 Oh, but we love the finished product,

579
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,020
 but we don't want to go through the unfinished process.

580
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,860
 God says to Israel, "Take that very small thing

581
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,200
 "that seems so feeble, so weak, and pray over it.

582
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,060
 "God bless it, God bless it."

583
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,060
 And watch what God can do

584
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,080
 when he can take the small thing in your life,

585
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,860
 the thing that he's called you to be faithful with right now.

586
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,260
 Yeah, you want that promotion.

587
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,780
 Yes, you want that success.

588
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,260
 Of course you wanna get married.

589
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,540
 God understands all that,

590
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,900
 but he's put something in your hand right now

591
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,620
 that is the cornerstone, and he's saying, "Bless that."

592
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,700
 Like pray, speak life,

593
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,780
 bless the thing that I've put in your hands.

594
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,500
 And from there, not by your power, not by your might,

595
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,940
 but by my spirit, says the Lord.

596
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,080
 Then see what's gonna take place before you.

597
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,320
 This is why Zerubbabel is told this in verse seven,

598
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,200
 right at the start.

599
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
 This is God speaking.

600
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,220
 He goes, "What are you, O mighty mountain?

601
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,280
 "Before Zerubbabel, you will become a level ground.

602
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,280
 "What are you, O mountain, O obstacle?"

603
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,360
 There are always going to be obstacles

604
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,720
 between our small start and the big finish.

605
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,920
 It's always gonna be the big things that are there,

606
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,520
 and God stands before Israel,

607
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,800
 and he speaks to the big obstacles.

608
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,780
 And he says, "What are you, O mountain?

609
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,640
 "You'll be nothing.

610
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,200
 "You're gonna become a level ground before Zerubbabel.

611
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,040
 "Why?

612
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,000
 "Because it's by my spirit.

613
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,820
 "If it was up to might and power of my humans,

614
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,600
 "the obstacles will overwhelm them every single time."

615
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,540
 This is jumping us back to Numbers 13 and 14, isn't it?

616
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,160
 Where the Israelites go in to what God has promised,

617
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,960
 the big thing of the promised land,

618
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,800
 and they go in there,

619
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,360
 and they're overwhelmed by the obstacle in front of it.

620
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
 And they're so overwhelmed

621
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,560
 that they turn their back on the big thing.

622
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,240
 And God's saying to Israel, "If you live by my spirit,

623
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,280
 "if you take the small things, the beginning thing,

624
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,360
 "and you say, 'God, bless this, just this little,

625
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,340
 "'this is my offering, this is all I've got,

626
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,360
 "'this is all I am right now, this thing here,

627
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,080
 "'would you bless it, would you bless it?'"

628
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,120
 Watch what he can do.

629
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,680
 Even the greatest obstacles can be rendered down,

630
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,340
 can be pulled flat before him.

631
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:09,200
 You cannot pull down the obstacles,

632
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,240
 but the Spirit of God working in your faithfulness

633
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,320
 on the day-to-day things that you're doing

634
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,360
 can literally move mountains.

635
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,640
 Will you focus on the small?

636
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,880
 I wonder if this reminds you of anything else

637
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,120
 that we see in Scripture.

638
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,000
 Some 600 years later, Jesus is gathered with his disciples,

639
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,600
 and he's trying to teach them a little bit

640
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,320
 about the kingdom of God.

641
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,360
 And in this moment, he gathers them around him,

642
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,780
 and he draws from the imagery of Zechariah 4.

643
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,520
 And he's trying to communicate to them

644
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,600
 the kind of faith that they need

645
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,840
 for the journey that's ahead of them.

646
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,960
 I want you to see this from Matthew 17,

647
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
 starting in verse 20.

648
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,660
 It says, "I tell you the truth.

649
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,680
 "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed,

650
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,160
 "you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here and there,

651
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,800
 "'and it will move, for nothing will be impossible for you.'"

652
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,400
 If you have faith as small as a mustard seed,

653
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,920
 this mountain will be changed, will be moved down.

654
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,000
 This is imagery from Zechariah 4.

655
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,080
 Jesus is taking it,

656
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,660
 speaking familiar imagery over his disciples.

657
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,160
 They knew the Old Testament well.

658
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,400
 And he's trying to tell them,

659
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,440
 all you need to do is have some small faith.

660
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,040
 Now, we misinterpret this verse all the time.

661
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,080
 Preachers mispreach this all the time.

662
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,280
 They stand in front of their churches,

663
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,500
 and they go, "You gotta have more faith.

664
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,700
 "Like, if only we have more faith,

665
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,780
 "the mountains will move.

666
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,000
 "Let's get more faith."

667
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,760
 And Jesus is saying the exact opposite.

668
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,680
 He's saying it doesn't matter the bigness,

669
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,360
 the size of your faith.

670
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,600
 What matters, even if your faith is as small

671
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
 as a mustard seed, what matters is God bless it.

672
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,000
 God bless it.

673
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,200
 Like, if you give it to me, I will move the mountains.

674
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 Nothing will be impossible for you.

675
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,640
 And this is God's invitation to his church,

676
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,920
 to recognize that it's not about them,

677
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,520
 just the smallest faith

678
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,520
 that almost seems imperceptible

679
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,980
 to everybody else around you.

680
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,600
 That one person where you look at their life,

681
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
 and you say, "I don't think they're really a Christian."

682
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,360
 That one person that you judge across the aisle on Sundays.

683
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,600
 If they dress like that, they must be not really

684
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,760
 a Bible-believing, spirit-filled Christian.

685
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,960
 The ones who often do the greatest things

686
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,520
 in the New Testament are the ones

687
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,880
 that were least expected to do the great things.

688
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
 Because everybody was like the Pharisees,

689
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,240
 looking for the big and the perfect and the holy and the that.

690
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,440
 And Jesus comes along and says, "You see that centurion?

691
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,200
 "You see that woman who bled for 12 years

692
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,760
 "and you all avoided her?

693
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,080
 "You see this woman who's just anointed me

694
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,120
 "and you think she's a prostitute?

695
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,600
 "You see all of this?

696
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,040
 "A faith as small as a mustard seed.

697
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,640
 "It's the day of small things.

698
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,560
 "I work to the big when the small step by step,

699
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,160
 "and it's a little bit of faithfulness.

700
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,920
 "I then join that faithfulness

701
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,840
 "and watch what is about to take place."

702
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,680
 And there's this great bit here.

703
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,440
 It says, "If only then the mountain

704
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,600
 "would become level ground."

705
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,240
 Zerubbabel, you will see it.

706
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,960
 It will become level ground before you.

707
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,240
 When I took on the vine in 2013,

708
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,000
 I was handed $25 million in debt.

709
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,680
 This church was $25 million Hong Kong dollars in debt.

710
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,800
 And I knew that was coming to me.

711
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,440
 I knew that was part of the deal.

712
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,960
 Didn't like it.

713
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,400
 And I have to say, at the time, I was like,

714
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,640
 this is a little bit overwhelming.

715
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,480
 I was 37 years old.

716
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,120
 And I knew on the one side that this wasn't my debt.

717
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,080
 It was the vine's debt.

718
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,320
 I knew that this was all of our responsibility,

719
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
 not just my responsibility.

720
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,480
 But you know, as a 37-year-old, new, fresh senior pastor,

721
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,800
 stepping into a role of two incredible men,

722
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,720
 John and Tony had done such a fantastic job

723
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,040
 of leading this church all these years.

724
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,960
 There was already so much pressure.

725
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,400
 And then it was $25 million.

726
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,480
 And I remember thinking to myself,

727
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,560
 I don't have John's gift of fundraising.

728
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,520
 I'm not like that.

729
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,480
 I don't have the ability to stand in front of people

730
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,920
 and ask them for money and all this kind of stuff.

731
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,560
 Like, that's not really who I am.

732
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,040
 And I remember feeling so overwhelmed by the giant.

733
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,720
 And I wanted God just to remove it from me.

734
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,600
 I wanted like one person to write a $25 million check

735
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,680
 and then everything's done and gone, right?

736
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,760
 Ever prayed those prayers?

737
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
 God, I want the finished product now.

738
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,840
 I don't want the unfinished process.

739
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,760
 And I remember praying about this

740
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,840
 'cause it was weighing on me.

741
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,960
 I was stressed about it.

742
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,200
 It was overwhelming to me.

743
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,120
 And God said, "Andrew, what have I put in your hands?"

744
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,520
 And I was like, "$25 million in debt."

745
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,360
 No, just kidding.

746
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
 No. (audience laughing)

747
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,200
 I was like, "Well, I love to preach.

748
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
 "I love to preach and teach."

749
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,520
 He's like, "You stay faithful to what I put in your hands.

750
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,560
 "I will provide and I'll remove the debt from you."

751
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,120
 Now, I'd like to say it happened by a $25 million check.

752
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,640
 I thought it was gonna take maybe five years,

753
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,880
 maybe 10 years.

754
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,960
 We were able to wipe out the debt in a year and a half.

755
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,160
 Why?

756
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,720
 Because so many people in this room

757
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
 were incredibly generous

758
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,800
 and were willing to do the small thing

759
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,720
 that was in their hand.

760
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,800
 Here's $100 regularly every week.

761
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,640
 Here's $1,000.

762
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,480
 Here's 10,000.

763
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
 We had some people write $1 million.

764
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,120
 We had a lot of people do a lot of faithful,

765
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,800
 generous things because they took the small thing

766
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,000
 that was in their hand

767
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,960
 and they're willing to say, "God bless it, God bless it."

768
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,320
 And as a group together,

769
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,160
 we were able to see 25 million just descend like that.

770
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,680
 That's my heart for us as a church.

771
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,800
 What is my heart?

772
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,680
 That you would recognize that the small thing

773
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,960
 God has put in your hand,

774
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,240
 even though at times it might feel like the big thing

775
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,880
 is a long, long way off,

776
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,680
 that small thing blessed by God

777
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,480
 can be a blessing way beyond

778
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,760
 you would ever think or ever imagine.

779
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,480
 You are a small thing in God's hands.

780
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,800
 You're not that important.

781
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,240
 You're not that talented.

782
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,400
 You're not that amazing.

783
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,560
 There's always gonna be more talented,

784
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,080
 better looking, perfect bodies.

785
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,160
 (congregation laughing)

786
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,680
 It's always gonna be that other person

787
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,040
 that you wish you were to be.

788
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,720
 You're always gonna feel small in somebody's eyes

789
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,040
 and probably in your eyes.

790
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,040
 You are a small thing,

791
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,920
 but you're a small thing in the hand of a father

792
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,560
 who stands over you and says, "God bless this one.

793
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,840
 "God bless this one.

794
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,480
 "Let's see what I might do through this."

795
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,800
 'Cause it's not by their might, nor by their power.

796
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,680
 And their resume is good and their studies are good

797
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
 and they've got some great skills,

798
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,800
 and that's all good, and God uses that stuff.

799
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,760
 But it's by my spirit that's really gonna do this.

800
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,680
 (congregation applauding)

801
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
 So here's,

802
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,240
 thank you.

803
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,800
 Here's verse eight.

804
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,560
 "Then the word of the Lord came to me and said this,

805
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,280
 "'The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations

806
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
 "'of this temple.

807
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,360
 "'His hands will also complete this.'"

808
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,040
 Could you imagine what it would've been like for Zerubbabel?

809
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,120
 He's standing in the rubble,

810
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,240
 and he's standing in all that rubble,

811
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,320
 and everybody's despising that there's not more progress

812
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,920
 that's been made, and God says,

813
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,840
 "Zerubbabel, you're gonna bring out the cornerstone.

814
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,600
 "You're gonna say, 'God bless it, God bless it.'"

815
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,720
 And then in front of everybody, God says,

816
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,520
 "Your hands will lay the foundation of this temple.

817
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,200
 "Your hands will see it completed."

818
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,880
 In other words, I'm a faithful God.

819
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,800
 I'm gonna be with you every step of the way.

820
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,120
 I'm not just there at the start,

821
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,040
 but I will walk with you every small,

822
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,080
 every step you do all the way to the end.

823
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,360
 You're gonna lay down the foundation stone,

824
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,960
 then you're gonna grab the next brick,

825
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,520
 and then you're gonna grab the next brick,

826
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,440
 and there's a hundred other people that will grab bricks,

827
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,520
 and you're all gonna build,

828
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,760
 and you will eventually stand back, Zerubbabel,

829
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,680
 and you will see the glory of the temple.

830
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,520
 But right now, do not despise the day of small things.

831
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,120
 Right now, recognize that I'm at work in this very moment.

832
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,280
 Your hands will start it, your hands will complete it.

833
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,640
 I love the focus on the hands of Zerubbabel,

834
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,800
 'cause God could've snapped his fingers

835
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,520
 and created the temple just like that.

836
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,160
 He had the might and the power to do so.

837
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,080
 But God doesn't do that,

838
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,720
 because he knows that in his hands he could,

839
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,040
 but he also knows that in Zerubbabel's hands he can't.

840
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,680
 So he doesn't ask him to do the great big thing.

841
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,480
 He just says, do the first thing,

842
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,160
 the cornerstone, the capstone, and bless it,

843
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,040
 and then take the next stone and do that,

844
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,840
 and in your faithfulness,

845
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,520
 you will see something significant take place.

846
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,240
 I think Hong Kong is crying out now for churches.

847
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,320
 They're just willing to do the next thing,

848
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,440
 the small thing,

849
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,680
 the thing that they have been called to do

850
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,240
 in their workplaces, in their schools, in their families,

851
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,160
 to begin to really begin to see

852
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,480
 the work of the temple of God.

853
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,220
 Some of you in this room,

854
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,160
 you're disappointed in yourself

855
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,560
 because you don't see the temple there.

856
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,400
 When God looks at you and he says,

857
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,320
 oh, there's this unfinished temple that I'm creating,

858
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,120
 and I'm so excited about it,

859
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,400
 there's so much more to come.

860
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,280
 Some of you here, you don't realize this,

861
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,360
 but you're a dream in God's heart.

862
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,400
 And he wants you to basically say,

863
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,640
 I'm not the finished product,

864
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,640
 but I have a cornerstone in me.

865
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,840
 I have the little small thing right now,

866
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,560
 and I'm trusting the faithfulness to the small thing.

867
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,640
 I'm leaving the big thing up to him,

868
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,280
 but I'm gonna trust him with the small thing in my hands.

869
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,420
 What is the small thing that is in your hand right now?

870
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,120
 The one thing that God has given you,

871
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,720
 where if you think about all that needs

872
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,380
 to be accomplished and done, it'll overwhelm you,

873
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,640
 but that small little thing

874
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,800
 that he's just placed in your hand,

875
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,480
 what is that right now for you?

876
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,280
 As I close, let me tell you what it is for me.

877
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,360
 I'm writing a book, and if my wife was here,

878
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,680
 she would roll her eyes,

879
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,440
 'cause I've said that phrase for the last decade of my life,

880
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,940
 and I have not written a book yet.

881
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:43,560
 I have four lines, the opening four lines of my book,

882
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,480
 that is literally what I have on my computer right now.

883
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,720
 If you were here last Sunday,

884
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,800
 you would have seen me do the parable of the prodigal son

885
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
 in first-person narrative, remember?

886
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,820
 So my book, what I'm writing is,

887
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,000
 I'm writing the first three chapters of the Bible,

888
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,600
 Genesis 1, 2, and 3, so creation and full,

889
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,920
 and I'm writing it from the first-person perspective

890
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,680
 of Adam and Eve.

891
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,520
 Cool, right?

892
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,440
 Okay.

893
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,600
 (congregation laughing)

894
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,680
 It's gonna be a bestseller.

895
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,280
 And I have four lines.

896
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,360
 I mean, they're really good lines,

897
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,060
 but I have four lines.

898
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,260
 It's like a cornerstone.

899
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,480
 Would you like to hear them?

900
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,680
 Okay, I'm gonna read you my four lines.

901
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,040
 Here they are.

902
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,960
 This is the opening of my book.

903
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,360
 "I was born of dirt and breath and hope.

904
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,960
 Hope conceived me, its tender finger

905
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,720
 impregnating the barren soil

906
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,480
 as it carefully shaped the potential of man.

907
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,000
 Breath birthed me, a wisp of sound and syllables

908
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,080
 rushing forth the glory of life,

909
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,660
 and dirt betrayed me,

910
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,740
 the very substance that brought me to life

911
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,640
 becoming the very substance that would lead me to death."

912
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,020
 (congregation applauding)

913
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:50,560
 Four sentences.

914
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,780
 I need, it's not ready yet, no.

915
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,800
 (congregation laughing)

916
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,680
 I'm gonna need 60,000, 100,000,

917
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,600
 and it feels like a long way away,

918
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,280
 and I'm pretty happy with my first four sentences,

919
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,360
 but there's a lot more sentences that need to come.

920
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,000
 And I stand over this today in front of you,

921
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,180
 and I say, "God bless it, God bless it."

922
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,520
 'Cause that's all I've got.

923
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,920
 And maybe there's something in your hands right now,

924
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,040
 a dream, a hope, a vision, an idea,

925
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,440
 new thing to do at work,

926
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,880
 a new thing you want for your family,

927
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,440
 maybe that marriage we're talking about,

928
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,400
 maybe you are working out and wanting a better body,

929
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,520
 whatever it is, there's something in front of you,

930
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,200
 and you've just got what you've got right now,

931
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,400
 and it disappoints you.

932
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,040
 Take it in your hands today,

933
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,400
 and say, "God bless it, God bless it."

934
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,400
 Do not, church, despise the day of small things.

935
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,280
 Could you stand with me?

936
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,120
 Let's pray.

937
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:51,380
 Father, we stand together as a church right now,

938
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,640
 recognizing that we're people just like the Israelites,

939
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,680
 who are obsessed with the big and the grand,

940
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,820
 that we want the finished product,

941
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,800
 and we're not so crazy about the unfinished process.

942
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,380
 And Father, as we stand before you in this moment,

943
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,760
 online and in this room,

944
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,300
 Father, we do so now with open hearts, open minds,

945
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,920
 and with open hands.

946
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,760
 Lord, you've been speaking a lot in this scripture

947
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,620
 about hands today.

948
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,480
 And I wonder whether you would just join me,

949
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,560
 if you're willing, just to open your hands before you,

950
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,120
 and in your hands, I want you to picture

951
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,300
 what that thing is that you've resonated with today.

952
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,720
 Maybe for some of you, it's a long-held dream

953
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,540
 that hasn't yet come to fruition.

954
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,320
 Maybe it's a word or a promise of God

955
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,240
 that He's spoken over you at some point in your life

956
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,740
 that is yet to be fulfilled.

957
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,820
 Maybe it's a project that you're working on

958
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,140
 that seems a long way off, like my book.

959
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,160
 Maybe it's whatever it is,

960
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,840
 but there's something in your hands today

961
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,560
 and that small thing, it's very easy for you to despise.

962
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,440
 It's very easy for you to be frustrated.

963
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,320
 It's very easy for you to feel like it's not worth much.

964
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,300
 It's not valuable.

965
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,960
 Like the Israelites, when they looked at those rubble stones,

966
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,160
 were like, so surprised that not more progress

967
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,600
 has been made.

968
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,000
 And yet you're holding this thing

969
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,100
 because the Lord has put it in your hands.

970
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,880
 And God would say, first of all, over you,

971
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,320
 your hands will begin it.

972
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,720
 Your hands will complete it.

973
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,760
 I'll be with you every step of the way.

974
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,280
 For I'm God, your Savior,

975
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,880
 'cause it's not gonna be by your power.

976
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,440
 It's not gonna be by your might.

977
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,800
 It's gonna be by my Spirit.

978
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,960
 And that thing you're holding in your hands,

979
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,480
 feel the Spirit, the presence of God

980
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,000
 leaning over you right now and saying these words,

981
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,440
 God bless it, God bless it.

982
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,240
 And as your senior pastor, I stand over you now

983
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,120
 as you're in this room with your eyes closed

984
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,840
 or whether you're online as well,

985
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,800
 and you got your hands and you're holding forward something,

986
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,040
 allow me and the authority that's given to me

987
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,720
 here at this church to speak over you now.

988
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,720
 God bless it, God bless it, God bless it, God bless it.

989
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,560
 Take the small things, Lord.

990
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,000
 The things that we've almost given up on,

991
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,700
 the things that we were gonna throw away,

992
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,760
 the things that we felt like weren't worthy, Lord.

993
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,660
 We take the cornerstones, the rubble, Lord,

994
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,480
 that's gonna place the foundations of the temple.

995
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,680
 And Lord, we play a blessing over it

996
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,880
 in the name of Jesus right now.

997
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,400
 And Father, I wanna pray that you would leave

998
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,280
 or send out a bunch of people from this room today

999
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,160
 who are going with a stronger step,

1000
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,320
 with more hope in their hearts

1001
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,520
 because of the day of small things.

1002
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,960
 That they would take what the Scriptures say

1003
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,240
 and ask you to come and bless these small things.

1004
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,800
 That Lord, you would rise up hope

1005
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,720
 and that we would see, like with those $25 million,

1006
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,120
 that the big mountain would be chipped away at and removed

1007
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,600
 just by the small mustard seed of those faithful day in,

1008
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,760
 day out in disciplines, conviction, prayers, hope,

1009
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,320
 holding on in steadfastness

1010
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,200
 for all the things that God can do.

1011
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,360
 Lord, take the small thing that is in our hands.

1012
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,400
 Would you bless it and would it be your Spirit

1013
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,920
 that brings it to the fullness of fruition?

1014
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,600
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1015
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,200
 (upbeat music)

1016
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,780
 (upbeat music)
