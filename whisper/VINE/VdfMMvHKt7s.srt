1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 My name, if you don't know, is Andrew George Gardner.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,720
 Andrew George Gardner.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,520
 I can't believe I've just told you my middle name, okay?

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,680
 Andrew was my father's middle name.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,600
 George was his father's first name.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,360
 My name is not random.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,600
 My name is not arbitrary, it wasn't just something that came up.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,360
 My parents just didn't think they were nice-sounding words.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,120
 My name has a meaning.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,600
 It links me to the generations of the men in my family.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,240
 As I walk forward with my name, I carry the character

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,680
 and the lives and the legacy of my late father and his late father.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,720
 And I'm proud of the name that I hold.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,640
 One of the problems with my name, though, is that Andrew means "strong and manly,"

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,520
 so I don't know where my parents got that one from, but...

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,080
 But names matter.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,160
 Names actually carry something in them.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,280
 I don't know if you've ever stopped to think about your name or what your name carries.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
 Every single person in this room, your name has a story to it.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
 And if you don't know the story of your name, I want to invite you this week,

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,240
 some homework to do, to find the story behind your name.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,520
 I know within the Asian culture, for example, that your name is not random at all.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,320
 Your name came from many, many months of lots of conversation and discussion

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,720
 amongst all your relatives, deciding what you should be under a certain lunar new year

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,520
 and a certain kind of thing, wanting to describe something that was audacious and beautiful,

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,560
 written in both Chinese and spoken aloud, so that your name means something.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
 Are you with me?

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,320
 Names matter.

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,800
 If you were to read my name, Andrew George Gardner, you didn't know anything about me.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,960
 You would know that I'm not Italian.

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,240
 Right?

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,440
 You would know I'm not Chinese.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,960
 You would know that I'm not French.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,440
 I mean, there is nothing more English than Andrew George Gardner.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,480
 I mean, you can't even say it without trying to pretend you're English.

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,720
 Andrew George Gardner is like the kind of way in which you should say my name.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,640
 There's an old Chinese proverb that says this,

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,440
 it says, "The beginning of all wisdom is to call things by their right name."

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,640
 Isn't that beautiful?

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,400
 The beginning of all wisdom is to make sure that you're naming things right,

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,240
 that you're describing something with the words in which you're giving it,

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,280
 because your words matter, and names have the power to shape a story.

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,440
 I was reminded of this just a few years ago

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,600
 when my wife and I were in Thailand in Chiang Mai,

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,320
 and as we're in Chiang Mai, we were invited by an NGO

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,160
 to come to a grand dinner that they were putting on,

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,880
 one of those dinners where you have to dress up and be real smart,

48
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,920
 and where they put name tags on every chair

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,600
 so that you know exactly where you're to sit.

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,400
 And I show up to my table, and there's my name tag,

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,920
 and right next to it is somebody else's name tag,

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,640
 and when I read that name, fear came over me.

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,320
 Let me show you, I took a photo of it.

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,360
 Here was the photo.

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,960
 So there on the right is boring old Andrew Gardner,

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,000
 and on the left, the name tag read, "HRH Prince Michael."

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
 I have no idea who this is,

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,120
 but this man is so important, he doesn't need a last name.

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
 HRH means "His Royal Highness."

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,960
 Prince means that he's a son of a duke.

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,120
 I knew that he was obviously royalty,

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,680
 but I didn't know anything about what kind of royalty this was,

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,840
 which is really embarrassing because I'm English,

64
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,520
 and he's a part of the English royal family, OK?

65
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,480
 But I grew up most of my time in Hong Kong,

66
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,280
 like I'm a pretty poor subject when it comes to being English, right?

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
 So he shows up, I don't know what to do.

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,240
 Do I shake his hand? Do I bow?

69
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,960
 So I do a shake bow.

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,040
 (Laughter)

71
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,000
 Because I figured I got both covered if I do the shake bow.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,640
 I could tell that he was used to people doing the shake bow.

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
 He was very gracious to me.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,760
 Turns out that His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,720
 is actually the cousin of our late queen,

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
 if you're British here, the cousin of your late queen.

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
 Now, here's the interesting thing.

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,440
 I was very honest with him up front.

79
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,840
 I'm like, "Hey, I grew up in Hong Kong.

80
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,760
 I'm English, but I don't know much about royalty.

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,840
 Could you tell me about your family?"

82
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,720
 Oh, you should have seen his eyes.

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,400
 His eyes just lit up.

84
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,600
 And he started to tell me all about his family

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
 and how his family was carried and the importance of his name.

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
 He had just been at a wedding.

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
 Do you know what wedding he'd just been at?

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,960
 Catherine and William's wedding.

89
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,520
 He gave me all the inside goss about that wedding.

90
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,360
 It was awesome!

91
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
 He was telling me these amazing facts about being royal.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,120
 He actually told me a story.

93
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,800
 He said this.

94
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,720
 He said, "You wouldn't know this, but," he said,

95
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,920
 "every member of my family, including myself,

96
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,240
 have all been married in the same church for generations.

97
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,240
 In fact, it goes all the way back to the 15th century,

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,920
 married in the same church since the 15th century."

99
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,120
 To which I replied, "I got married in a chapel in Las Vegas

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,920
 that dates back to the '70s."

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 He didn't find that funny.

102
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,640
 It was a joke, but he didn't find it funny at all.

103
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,920
 We had the most amazing night, but it reminded me

104
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,280
 of something that I think is so central to our scriptures.

105
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,760
 And that's this, that names matter.

106
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,720
 That names hold character and nature and story and destiny.

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 That names that are used in scripture are not random.

108
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,880
 In fact, here's a biblical interpretation technique

109
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,680
 for every single one of you here.

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
 And it's this, anytime you come across a name in scripture,

111
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
 you should stop and ask yourself,

112
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,880
 what does this name mean?

113
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,040
 Because the Bible writers don't throw names in there,

114
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,720
 whether it's the name of a village or a name of a person.

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,960
 By random, they want you to understand something

116
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
 about who they are based on their name.

117
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,800
 Jesus was in the habit of naming things by their right name.

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,760
 And if somebody didn't have the right name,

119
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,400
 he would change it on the spot.

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,760
 How weird would that be?

121
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,680
 Imagine if I did that with you.

122
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
 Oh, hi, your name's Frank.

123
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,640
 Nice to meet you.

124
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,000
 I'm gonna call you John.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,320
 He would go up to Simon and say,

126
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 "Hey, Simon, nice to meet you.

127
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,480
 "You're now gonna be called Peter,

128
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,400
 "because on this rock," Peter means rock,

129
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,160
 "I'm going to build my church."

130
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,960
 Jesus was in the habit of making sure

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,800
 that people understood the name that was within them

132
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,320
 and what that name meant.

133
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,000
 And what you see throughout scripture

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
 is that there's power in a name.

135
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,520
 Now, what you've also got to understand

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,400
 and what we see in scripture and we see in our humanity

137
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,200
 is the reality that names can not only shape us for good,

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,760
 they can also shape us for bad.

139
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,840
 In fact, that there's for all of us,

140
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,440
 names that we carry around that begin to form

141
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,360
 and shape inside of us,

142
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,000
 that don't actually release us

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,960
 into a wonderful new trajectory of God or life,

144
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,320
 but actually names that hold us back

145
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,680
 and that speak into us

146
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,800
 and begin to form and shape something in us.

147
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,680
 We all need to realize that actually,

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,840
 so often words spoken over us

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,760
 might seem just kind of normal and surface,

150
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,160
 but when they're spoken over us,

151
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
 they have the power to come down

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,960
 and actually form and shape within us our core beliefs.

153
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,320
 And so often the actual names

154
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,000
 that you carry around with you,

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,760
 not talking about your legal name,

156
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
 I'm talking about the names

157
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,560
 that you say over yourself inside of you

158
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,360
 are formed by other people's perspectives

159
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,280
 and opinions about you.

160
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,640
 And when people speak over you

161
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,360
 with their perspectives and their opinions,

162
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,080
 when they try to say something to you,

163
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,520
 when they try to form and shape your narrative,

164
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,960
 we often take those words,

165
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,600
 particularly if they're spoken over somebody

166
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,360
 in authority of our lives,

167
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,560
 a teacher or dare I say a pastor,

168
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,080
 or a loved one or a friend or a family member,

169
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,000
 but these words are spoken,

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,600
 we take them down and they begin to shape these names

171
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 that so often are destructive rather than releasing.

172
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,320
 Give me an example of some.

173
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,080
 When somebody says things like this over you,

174
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,800
 "Hey, I know you mean well,

175
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,200
 "but you're not actually really that smart."

176
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,520
 Or what about if someone says,

177
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,480
 "Hey, I think if you lost a little bit of weight,

178
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,280
 "somebody might actually like you."

179
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,560
 What about a word like,

180
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
 "Hey, you did your best,

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,400
 "but there are just other people who are better than you."

182
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,360
 Or how about this,

183
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,880
 "I wish you could be more like your sister."

184
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,440
 You will always be deserted.

185
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,720
 Everyone is going to desert you.

186
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,440
 People say phrases like this and speak stuff over us,

187
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,760
 and perhaps people have spoken stuff like this over you,

188
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
 and they go down and they begin to shape

189
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,520
 and form something in us.

190
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,760
 And what we do with the words people say

191
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,840
 is that we create names and we begin to label ourselves.

192
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,040
 We begin to speak about things in our inner being.

193
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,120
 So the idea of, "Hey, you're not very smart,"

194
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,760
 gets internalized like this, "I am an idiot."

195
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,040
 If somebody says over you,

196
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,760
 "Hey, you should lose a little bit of weight."

197
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,800
 "I am unattractive."

198
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,920
 Somebody says over you,

199
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,360
 "Hey, there are other people better than you."

200
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,040
 "I am inadequate."

201
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,560
 "You should be more like your sister."

202
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,280
 "I'm a failure."

203
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,440
 Everyone's going to desert you.

204
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
 "I'm alone."

205
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,600
 Look at this, idiot, unattractive, inadequate, failure, alone.

206
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 And these become the names that we begin to name ourselves.

207
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,480
 And we got to understand

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,880
 that what we name ourselves has power.

209
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,680
 What we name ourselves begins to shape and structure

210
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,560
 our trajectory and our future.

211
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,800
 It begins to actually form and shape our opinions

212
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,000
 about ourselves and about the world.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
 And those names that we carry deep inside of us

214
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,800
 begin to actually come out in our decisions,

215
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
 come out in the things we say,

216
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,120
 come out in how we begin to think and label ourselves.

217
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,080
 And we begin to walk in a way

218
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,200
 that is way not the way God wants us to walk.

219
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,880
 And I want to point this out to you

220
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,920
 because I think this is actually

221
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,040
 one of the most important strategies

222
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,560
 that the enemy has against God's people.

223
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,480
 Because if the enemy can do anything,

224
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,360
 it's that he wants you to think of yourself

225
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,480
 less than how God thinks of you.

226
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,320
 He wants you to label yourself in a way

227
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,760
 that God would never label you.

228
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,880
 And he wants you to do that

229
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,160
 because he knows that if he can get you to feel that way,

230
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,040
 he's gonna stop the trajectory of your life in Christ Jesus.

231
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,120
 And if Satan wants anything, he wants a defeated church.

232
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,880
 And when this stuff happens in us,

233
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
 I have a phrase for it in the spirit.

234
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,880
 It's this idea of the slavery of the soul.

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,960
 And if you're anything like me here today,

236
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,680
 you're wrestling somewhat with the slavery of the soul

237
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,600
 by the names that you have come to label yourself.

238
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,400
 The greatest struggle that I think we have as human beings

239
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,360
 is this struggle between this difference

240
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,920
 that is inside of us,

241
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,360
 a difference that actually chains us to bondage

242
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,600
 and slavery in our inner person.

243
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,780
 And that difference is this.

244
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,600
 The difference between who we really are

245
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,840
 and who we've come to believe we are.

246
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,520
 That difference will tear you apart.

247
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,760
 So many of us get lost

248
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,080
 between who we really are in Christ Jesus

249
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,080
 and who we've come to believe we are in our brokenness.

250
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,120
 Every single one of us in this room,

251
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,240
 every single one of us has come to believe

252
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,440
 that you are less than how Jesus sees you to be.

253
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,260
 Every single one of us.

254
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,660
 That's the work of the enemy.

255
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,140
 Now, I wanna say something right up front here

256
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,520
 that I believe will be encouragement to you.

257
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,460
 Every single one of us in this room

258
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,280
 is a broken and complicated person.

259
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,260
 And here's the good news.

260
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,900
 The Bible is full of broken and complicated people.

261
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,560
 In fact, I would actually say it like this.

262
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,280
 God actually targets broken and complicated people

263
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,800
 to use them for His glory, His purposes, and His promises.

264
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,120
 God actually has a habit

265
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,800
 of trying to find the most broken and complicated people

266
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,720
 and saying, "I can use these ones to bring my purposes

267
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
 "and my promises, my redemption, my salvation in the world."

268
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,820
 I mean, you just need to scan through the pages of the Bible

269
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,580
 to see how God targets people like this.

270
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,080
 Noah, called by God to actually be a deliverer of humanity

271
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,800
 by building an ark, was a drunk.

272
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,280
 Abraham, called by God to leave his family

273
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,080
 and start a new family that would become the nation of Israel

274
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,540
 was a habitual liar.

275
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,960
 Moses, called by God to go and deliver his people

276
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,480
 out of slavery in the broken Egypt

277
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,760
 and take them into the Promised Land, he was a murderer.

278
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,100
 David, who the Bible describes was after God's own heart,

279
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,780
 was an adulterer and a murderer.

280
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,060
 Peter, who God comes and says,

281
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,680
 "You're gonna be the one who would build my church,"

282
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,520
 Peter was a betrayer of his best friend.

283
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,260
 And the hard thing was his best friend was Jesus.

284
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,700
 God is in the habit of taking broken and hurting people

285
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,160
 and complicated people

286
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,760
 and doing amazing things through them.

287
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,520
 And if you're feeling somewhat broken

288
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,000
 and complicated in the room today,

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
 well, that's good news for you.

290
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,160
 Your complication doesn't disqualify you

291
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,560
 from God's ordination.

292
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,480
 Come on, church, I know you're here somewhere.

293
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,780
 Your complication does not disqualify you

294
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,480
 from God's ordination, from God's using you

295
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,280
 and His purposes and His promises in this world.

296
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
 Your brokenness and your complications

297
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,120
 is not an issue for God.

298
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,400
 What it is, is an issue for you,

299
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,040
 an issue for me.

300
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,640
 See, God's not put off by my brokenness

301
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,960
 and my complications, but I am.

302
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,440
 I'm the one who struggles in that brokenness.

303
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,640
 I'm the one who's come to allow that brokenness

304
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,400
 to define me more than how God defines me.

305
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,580
 I'm the one who's been under the struggle

306
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,360
 of some of those names that have come inside of me

307
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,400
 that have formed and shaped me into the man that I am today.

308
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,640
 Oh, it's not a problem to God

309
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,900
 because He looks down at me and He says,

310
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,560
 "This is my son whom I love.

311
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,960
 With him, I am well pleased."

312
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,200
 I'm the one who says, "I don't love.

313
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,280
 I'm not pleased.

314
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
 I'm broken.

315
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
 I'm a failure."

316
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,000
 Are you with me?

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,380
 The names that you carry have great power over you.

318
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,160
 And this is exactly what was happening for Israel.

319
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,240
 In this section of scripture

320
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
 that we've been looking at during this whole series,

321
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,680
 Isaiah 40 to 66,

322
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,480
 what was happening for Israel was that they were in a place

323
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,200
 where they had come to believe these new names

324
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
 that they were calling themselves

325
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,000
 out of their brokenness and hurt.

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,760
 I mean, 70 years in exile had been a tough time.

327
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,040
 And God had shown up now and said,

328
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,480
 "Hey, I'm doing a new thing.

329
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,240
 Will you not perceive it?"

330
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,640
 And the problem for Israel was

331
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,320
 that they were struggling to perceive it.

332
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,880
 They were struggling to see the new thing

333
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,120
 because they were actually on a trajectory

334
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,880
 of embracing the brokenness that was inside of them.

335
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,200
 They were allowing that to form and shape

336
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,840
 how they thought about their identity,

337
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,400
 how they thought about their nature,

338
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,160
 and how they thought about their future.

339
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,280
 So when God turns up and says, "I'm doing a new thing,"

340
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,920
 Israel were kind of like, "Yeah, but not us."

341
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,000
 In fact, if you look at this passage from 40 to 66,

342
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,120
 you get a sense of where Israel were.

343
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,320
 They were angry at God.

344
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,000
 They were upset at Him.

345
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,880
 They had seen their city destroyed

346
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
 and their temple pulled down.

347
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,600
 And they were wondering, where was God?

348
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,080
 They felt abandoned by God.

349
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,520
 They felt like He had left them alone,

350
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,640
 given up on them, turned His back on them.

351
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,480
 And in that place of abandonment,

352
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,080
 they felt dried up inside.

353
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,120
 They felt like it was over for them.

354
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,320
 They felt their future was bleak.

355
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,520
 This is really important to know,

356
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,320
 that the names that we give ourselves

357
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
 have the power to determine our destiny.

358
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,360
 And here's Israel going, "I've been abandoned.

359
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,040
 "I'm an orphan.

360
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,840
 "I've got no future.

361
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,360
 "There's no good thing for me ahead of me at all."

362
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,220
 And they're in this trajectory towards a destiny

363
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,800
 that was not God's destiny.

364
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,960
 And He shows up and says, "I've got a new thing for you.

365
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,320
 "I'm doing a new thing.

366
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,480
 "Can you perceive it?"

367
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,840
 And He's like, "There's no way they're gonna perceive it

368
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,360
 "because they're allowing the names inside of them

369
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,480
 "to determine where they're heading."

370
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,840
 God says, "Let me speak to you again.

371
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,840
 "Some of you in this room,

372
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,480
 "some of you watching online right now,

373
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,160
 "it's been years that you've been carrying around a name

374
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,320
 "that you've been given yourself,

375
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,940
 "that you have formed in yourself.

376
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,880
 "I'm a failure.

377
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,920
 "No one's gonna love me.

378
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,400
 "I can't attract anyone, whatever it might be.

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,100
 "And you've been carrying that around for years.

380
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:22,260
 "And for years, that has been determining your decisions.

381
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,320
 "And I'm here today to liberate you from years

382
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,080
 "of what the enemy has done in you

383
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,280
 "because you are not the sum total

384
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
 "of the worst thing you have done.

385
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,920
 "You are not the name

386
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,100
 "that you are currently holding in your heart.

387
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,720
 "There's a new name for you."

388
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,960
 And I wonder whether we would open our hearts today

389
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,680
 to hear what it is that the Lord wants to say

390
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,600
 to so many of us

391
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,560
 who know that there is a difference

392
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,920
 between who God says I am

393
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,200
 to who I have come to believe I am

394
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,720
 through my brokenness and my complications.

395
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,560
 Are you with me?

396
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,300
 I wanna show you how God does this for Israel.

397
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,120
 In chapter of 62,

398
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,480
 in this incredible section of scripture in Isaiah,

399
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,720
 he says this,

400
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,980
 "For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.

401
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,760
 "For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet

402
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,540
 "till her righteousness shines out like the dawn,

403
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,380
 "her salvation like a blazing torch.

404
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,880
 "I want you to hear right up front

405
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,520
 "the passion that God has in this moment for his people.

406
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,000
 "He knows that they're on a trajectory of a destiny

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,220
 "that he doesn't have for them.

408
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,160
 "He's stepping in to change how they perceive themselves.

409
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,320
 "And he starts by saying,

410
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,340
 "I see what's going on in your life

411
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,660
 "and I will not remain silent.

412
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,840
 "I haven't given up on you.

413
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,960
 "I'm not distant from you.

414
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,680
 "I see it, I care about it.

415
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,120
 "I will not remain quiet.

416
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,500
 "I will not remain silent

417
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,160
 "because I have a new destiny for you,

418
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,680
 "a new future for you,

419
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,820
 "where it's like salvation, like a blazing torch.

420
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,660
 "It's like the nations glorifying me through you.

421
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,200
 "I see all of this stuff in your future

422
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,100
 "and I'm not gonna remain silent

423
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,300
 "of the fact that you're not on that trajectory.

424
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,800
 "I care for you.

425
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,420
 "I love you.

426
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,980
 "I'm here for you."

427
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,660
 One of the things you could do is take that passage

428
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,220
 and put your name in it.

429
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,980
 For Sydney's sake, I will not keep silent.

430
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,540
 For Sydney's sake, I will not remain quiet

431
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,780
 till his righteousness shines out like the dawn

432
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,880
 and his salvation like a blazing torch.

433
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,360
 For Andrew's sake, I'm not gonna remain silent

434
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,240
 until those names that he has put inside of him,

435
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,160
 the names that have been spoken over him,

436
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
 which is causing him to live out an identity

437
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,520
 that is not Christ, until that is changed,

438
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,100
 I will not remain silent.

439
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,760
 You need to know that the Lord wants to liberate you

440
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,520
 from any of these names that you're holding.

441
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,960
 Notice what he says next in verse two and three.

442
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,640
 He says, "The nations will see your righteousness

443
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,840
 "and all the kings your glory,

444
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,700
 "and you will be called by a new name

445
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,980
 "that the mouth of the Lord will bestow.

446
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,660
 "You will be a crown of splendor in the Lord's hand,

447
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,620
 "a crown or a royal diadem in the hand of your God."

448
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,460
 I love this moment.

449
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,660
 He says, "There's a new name for you.

450
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,840
 "I see the old names that are tearing you apart.

451
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,720
 "I see the difference that is in you

452
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,300
 "between who you really are

453
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,380
 "and who you've come to believe you are

454
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,420
 "through the broken names that you've adopted

455
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,360
 "and that you've taken onto your nature.

456
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,780
 "I see that I have a new name for you,

457
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,680
 "and it's a name that you need to hear

458
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,600
 "because that name is going to change something,

459
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,720
 "shift something, turn something in your life.

460
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,780
 "That name is gonna move your destiny

461
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,560
 "from one thing to the next.

462
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,900
 "I've got something on my heart for you.

463
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,560
 "I know you intimately.

464
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,380
 "I wanna come and change what it is

465
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,000
 "that's happening in your life right now.

466
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,780
 "I see what the enemy has done, and it moves my heart.

467
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,580
 "Hear my voice, let me speak.

468
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,300
 "I've got a new name for you."

469
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,260
 And notice what he says here,

470
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,500
 'cause I think this is so key.

471
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,880
 He says, "I've got a new name for you

472
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,900
 "that the mouth of the Lord will bestow."

473
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,040
 Why is that important?

474
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,660
 It's important because the majority of names

475
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,860
 that we have, that we embrace,

476
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,640
 are names put there from the mouths of others.

477
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,900
 Names put there from the mouths of those around us.

478
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,820
 Maybe my ex-spouse said some things that caused me to,

479
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,180
 (groans)

480
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,060
 and believe some things about me that are a lie.

481
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,860
 Maybe that colleague or that boss pulled me down

482
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,300
 because they wanted to get the promotion.

483
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,780
 And that name, that thing they said about me,

484
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,840
 oh, I've begun to believe it.

485
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,780
 The names that will be destructive in your life

486
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,620
 will come always from some other voice other than God.

487
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,340
 And when God looks upon you and says,

488
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,660
 "We're gonna change something here,"

489
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,820
 it's his mouth, it's his voice.

490
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,220
 Not a voice from anyone else,

491
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,660
 not a voice from your pastor,

492
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,980
 not a voice from the preacher,

493
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,380
 not a voice from a good friend.

494
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,860
 It's gonna be the voice of God

495
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,660
 that is gonna change it for you.

496
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,780
 (congregation applauding)

497
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,340
 It's gonna be his voice

498
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,020
 that will shift something in your life.

499
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,380
 And I love the fact that you come to the Vine

500
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,420
 and listen to me and the other pastors preach,

501
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,400
 and we hope we share things that'll help you,

502
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,860
 but it is God's voice that will change you, not mine.

503
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,980
 It's his mouth that speaks.

504
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,340
 And my prayer for you today,

505
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,540
 both in this time now and in the week ahead,

506
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,220
 is that you will hear the voice of God

507
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,740
 speak a new name over you

508
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,540
 that will change everything for you.

509
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,140
 Notice what he says next, verse four.

510
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:44,300
 I love what God does here.

511
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,700
 He starts out by saying,

512
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,540
 "Let me name to you the names

513
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,140
 that are currently inside you.

514
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,180
 Let me speak out about how you've named yourself.

515
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,460
 Here's how you've called yourself, Israel.

516
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,660
 You've called yourself abandoned and desolate."

517
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,300
 God is really clear

518
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,860
 that he wants them to understand where they are,

519
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,220
 that they feel that way,

520
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,900
 abandoned by God and desolate.

521
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,460
 And I think those two names, abandoned and desolate,

522
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,820
 are not just for Israel,

523
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,100
 but I think they sum up all of the strategy

524
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,700
 of the enemy to hold us back

525
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
 from the person that we truly are.

526
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,060
 If the enemy wants you to have anything,

527
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,140
 it's for you to feel alone.

528
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,060
 It's for you to feel abandoned,

529
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,260
 abandoned by your friends,

530
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,580
 abandoned by your church,

531
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,500
 abandoned by God.

532
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,940
 And when we are abandoned,

533
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,340
 when we feel like we are alone,

534
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,940
 we dry up inside.

535
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,060
 The word desolate there,

536
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,940
 speaking about like a desert that's dry inside.

537
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,540
 We dry up, the joy is gone,

538
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,340
 the life and vitality is gone.

539
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,060
 We think we're no good to anybody.

540
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,860
 We think we've got nothing to offer this world.

541
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,420
 If we are abandoned,

542
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,540
 we find ourselves without joy.

543
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,580
 When we're abandoned or deserted or given up on,

544
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,060
 it dries us out inside.

545
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,300
 And God is very specific here

546
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,140
 because he wants Israel not to be shamed.

547
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,300
 God's not shaming Israel by doing this.

548
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,380
 God's doing something very powerful.

549
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,700
 He's saying, "You need to know where you're starting.

550
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,500
 You need to be honest

551
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,420
 about the names that the enemy has spoken to you.

552
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,580
 Before I give you a new name,

553
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,980
 let me uproot the old names.

554
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,060
 Let me tell you that old name."

555
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,860
 In order for God to give Israel a new destiny,

556
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,260
 he had to first invite them to be honest

557
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,460
 about their current one.

558
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,300
 Come on, church.

559
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,020
 Not to shame them,

560
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,140
 not to embarrass them

561
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,620
 because he really wants to help them.

562
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,980
 And that help's gonna start when Israel goes,

563
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,100
 "Oh man, I've embraced some names.

564
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,300
 I've called myself abandoned.

565
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,940
 I've called myself desolate.

566
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,420
 And that has begun to shape my thinking about God

567
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,620
 and my thinking about others

568
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,100
 and my thinking about my future.

569
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,220
 And this is where I'm at, God."

570
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,940
 This is my 10th year as senior pastor here at the Vine.

571
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,020
 And over these past 10 years,

572
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,980
 I've had to go through a very important

573
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,860
 and challenging journey

574
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,020
 of owning the names that I have named myself,

575
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,340
 of wrestling with the things

576
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,260
 that I feel the enemy has placed in me,

577
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,340
 that I've regurgitated and embraced

578
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,940
 and made an identity of.

579
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,700
 And I've had to wrestle with the Holy Spirit

580
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,660
 in a place of deep honesty about my broken names

581
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,180
 in order for me to receive a new name from him.

582
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,580
 I wanna just share some of the names

583
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,300
 that I've carried and still carry at times.

584
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,740
 The first would be forsaken.

585
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,060
 I've called myself forsaken and I felt forsaken.

586
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,540
 This happened when in my early 30s,

587
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,140
 I found out that I wasn't able

588
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,820
 to biologically father children.

589
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,900
 And when I found out that I couldn't do

590
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,900
 the very one thing that I had my heart set on,

591
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,180
 I wanted a family, I wanted to build a family.

592
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,980
 And when I discovered I couldn't do it,

593
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,700
 I was so angry at God

594
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,860
 because God had given me the dream for a family,

595
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,180
 but then it created me in such a way

596
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
 that it was impossible for me to do it.

597
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,860
 And I felt like he was laughing at me.

598
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,740
 So I felt abandoned.

599
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,620
 I felt like I was forsaken.

600
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,980
 And that became a part of my identity.

601
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,300
 Betrayer would be another name.

602
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,460
 My wife, in that moment, I felt like I had betrayed her.

603
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,340
 I felt like I had betrayed her dreams and her hopes.

604
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,380
 I felt like I had stopped her

605
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,140
 from having the one thing she had always wanted,

606
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
 which was to be pregnant.

607
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,900
 I felt like I had betrayed her trust in me

608
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,500
 and that I wasn't enough for her.

609
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,940
 Failure.

610
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,900
 If only you could be in my house on a Sunday evening

611
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,500
 after I preach three or four times on a Sunday,

612
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,580
 and you would come to understand

613
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,260
 how I've named myself failure.

614
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,260
 It's a regular ritual for me to get home after a big day

615
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,500
 and say, "Honey, man, I was bad today.

616
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,220
 "I didn't even know if anyone was listening.

617
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,820
 "People were getting up and going to the toilet

618
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,180
 "and doing all this stuff."

619
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,180
 There were people asleep on the front row.

620
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,540
 (audience laughing)

621
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,860
 No shame, no shame, I'm just being honest.

622
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,380
 And I'd get home and I'd say to her on a regular basis,

623
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,860
 "Am I doing anything that's helping anyone?

624
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,460
 "Maybe I should do something else."

625
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,300
 My wife would always go, "Oh gosh, here he goes again."

626
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,900
 And then she'd pass me a gin and tonic.

627
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,740
 "Take this, everything will be fine."

628
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,260
 (audience laughing)

629
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,100
 Hurter.

630
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,340
 Hurter is a name I've embraced recently.

631
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,060
 Being in leadership is a difficult thing.

632
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,500
 Many of us in this room are in leadership.

633
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,180
 Leadership's hard and it's difficult and challenging.

634
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,500
 And I've taken on the identity of someone who hurts somebody

635
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,220
 because I've made mistakes in leadership

636
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,900
 and that has hurt people.

637
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,740
 People on my staff and people in the congregation,

638
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,340
 particularly during some challenging times

639
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,500
 over the last three or four years

640
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,780
 when we were dealing with stuff in our city

641
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,460
 that we didn't know how to deal with.

642
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,180
 I know that I've hurt people in how I've led here.

643
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,060
 And I've taken on that as part of my persona and identity

644
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,180
 that I'm a hurter of people.

645
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,900
 Liar.

646
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,900
 By the way, this is a really bad list

647
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,780
 of things for your senior pastor to have.

648
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,540
 I hope you come back next week.

649
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,220
 But liar.

650
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,060
 Not that I go out and try to lie on a regular basis,

651
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,020
 but I know that sometimes there's a very thin line

652
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,620
 between the person I'm projecting to be

653
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,980
 and the person I really am.

654
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,580
 And I'm not just talking about my Instagram posts.

655
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,940
 But I think for all of us,

656
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,500
 often there's that fine line, isn't there,

657
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,980
 between what we want people to think about ourselves,

658
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,420
 how we want other people to label us,

659
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,540
 and if they really knew us, like really knew us,

660
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,780
 they would understand that the story is very different.

661
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,620
 And over the past 10 years, I've had to wrestle with these

662
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,860
 'cause I realized these are names

663
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,780
 that have come to form and shape me.

664
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,380
 And I think that you would be able

665
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,220
 to write your own list here

666
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,980
 of some of the things that you're carrying.

667
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,180
 Israel starts from the point of God saying,

668
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,780
 "Know the names that you are carrying."

669
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,460
 'Cause it's from that point that He can now speak.

670
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,060
 Notice what He says next here in verses four and five.

671
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,300
 He says, "I know that you've called yourself abandoned.

672
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,060
 "Your name will no longer be desolate,

673
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,700
 "for you will be called Hephzibah,

674
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,060
 "and your land will be called Beulah."

675
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,580
 Hephzibah means my delight is in her.

676
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,820
 Beulah means the land is married

677
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,020
 or there is a marriage that takes place.

678
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,300
 I want you to see what God does here

679
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,460
 'cause it's super powerful.

680
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,820
 He steps into this horrible moment for Israel

681
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,300
 where they're dealing with the reality

682
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,060
 of how they've begun to name themselves.

683
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,740
 And God says, "I've got a new name for you,

684
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,660
 "and my name for you is the absolute opposite

685
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,860
 "of how you're naming yourself right now.

686
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,220
 "You need to know that what I speak over you

687
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,620
 "is the complete opposite of it.

688
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,440
 "You feel abandoned, but you're actually married.

689
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,340
 "You think you've been given up on,

690
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,060
 "but actually your name is Beulah.

691
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,780
 "I married you, I love you, I'm here with you,

692
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,580
 "I'm walking with you, I'm intimate with you.

693
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,780
 "Like the intimacy of husband and wife and marriage

694
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,020
 "is my heart towards you, my people.

695
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,100
 "Oh, you feel desolate, you feel dry inside?

696
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,860
 "I understand that, I get that,

697
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,780
 "but I name you like this idea of Hephzibah,

698
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,340
 "which is my delight is in you.

699
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,940
 "I have a delight in you, I love you, I see you.

700
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,320
 "You're not dried up and given up on.

701
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,720
 "There's no joy left, I've got delight,

702
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,900
 "and I want you to know my delight in you."

703
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,820
 So he names Israel the absolute opposite

704
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,780
 of what they were naming themselves.

705
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,460
 And this is always a work of the spirit of God in church.

706
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,060
 He always comes up to you who are carrying broken names,

707
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,580
 names that say something about you that is not true.

708
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,740
 And God says, "You're not that, you're actually this.

709
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,600
 "You're not this broken stuff here.

710
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,380
 "I want you to know how I see you,

711
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,860
 "the way I wanted you to be,

712
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,540
 "and the way that you were created to be in Christ Jesus.

713
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,820
 "Even though there's a difference

714
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,660
 "between who you really are in Christ

715
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,500
 "and who you've come to believe in your brokenness,

716
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,980
 "I'm not gonna give you a name here,

717
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,700
 "I'm gonna give you a name here,

718
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,380
 "and this name is gonna uproot that name."

719
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,620
 Abandoned, married.

720
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,980
 Desolate, total delight.

721
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,380
 And God is doing this 'cause he so cares for his people.

722
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,700
 And he wants his people to know the goodness of a God

723
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,100
 who changes everything.

724
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,860
 And I want you to see something here

725
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,460
 that's really important.

726
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,860
 God does not name us based on our past actions,

727
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,740
 our present actions, or our future actions.

728
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,180
 Praise God.

729
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,060
 He names us on Jesus's past actions,

730
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,260
 Jesus's present actions, and Jesus's future actions.

731
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,940
 That's the way God names his people.

732
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,700
 In other words, he doesn't name you because of you.

733
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,900
 He names you because of him.

734
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,060
 He names you of his son, Jesus.

735
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,660
 Like how my name is Andrew George,

736
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,020
 connected to the men in my family.

737
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,100
 God sees you as his family,

738
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,740
 and he wants to connect you to his son, Christ Jesus,

739
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,580
 his one and only son.

740
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,060
 And so when he sees you, and when he speaks names over you,

741
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:22,060
 he names you in the generations of his family,

742
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,740
 right down to Jesus Christ.

743
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,940
 And he says, "You carry Jesus's name.

744
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,900
 "You carry my son's name.

745
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,960
 "You may not feel like you're righteous,

746
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,180
 "but you're righteous.

747
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,820
 "You may not feel holy, you're holy.

748
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,180
 "You may not feel like you have grace.

749
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,360
 "I have graced you.

750
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,180
 "These are the names for you."

751
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,020
 And he's calling his people to walk in the power

752
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,500
 of a new name, so that they would be in the trajectory

753
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,800
 and the destiny that he has for them.

754
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,300
 But I want you to hear this.

755
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,180
 I want you to hear something really important.

756
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,780
 Just because you have a new name,

757
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,800
 and therefore a new future,

758
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,900
 does not mean immediately you have a new nature.

759
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,220
 Come on, church, that's really good.

760
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,660
 Someone should write that down.

761
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,220
 (congregation laughing)

762
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,180
 Just because you have a new name and a new future

763
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,300
 does not mean you immediately have a new nature.

764
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,020
 And when God names us, what he's doing

765
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,460
 is he's declaring the starting point of a process.

766
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,220
 He's declaring a starting point of a new journey,

767
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,260
 a starting point of a new identity,

768
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,440
 a starting point of a new time in him.

769
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,100
 When he says you are holy, he's not necessarily saying

770
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,580
 you're holy in this moment, but you're holy in Christ Jesus.

771
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,620
 You're holy through the blood of Jesus.

772
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,300
 And you're on a trajectory and a destiny and a growth

773
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,780
 of becoming more and more like Christ Jesus.

774
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,980
 The Vine's whole vision statement

775
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,340
 is that we are growing big people here.

776
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,820
 Ephesians 4, Paul says, we become more and more

777
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,620
 like the image of Christ.

778
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,980
 That's a journey that we're on.

779
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,500
 It's the journey of sanctification.

780
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,540
 But because Jesus is the alpha and the omega,

781
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,340
 the beginning and the end, at the start of a new journey,

782
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,880
 he declares the outcome right at the beginning.

783
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,780
 You're holy, you're righteous, you're forgiven,

784
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,500
 you're filled with grace.

785
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,460
 Notice how he says it here in Isaiah 42,

786
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,300
 the same sort of section of scripture,

787
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,660
 just back a couple of chapters.

788
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,260
 He says, I am the Lord, that is my name.

789
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,460
 I will not give my glory to another.

790
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,140
 See, the form of things have taken place

791
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,020
 and new things now I declare over you.

792
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,700
 Before they spring into being, I announce them to you.

793
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,500
 Before they even happen, I'm gonna declare them.

794
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,000
 I'm gonna make the ends your beginning.

795
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,740
 Before it even takes place,

796
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,940
 before you even grow into this new identity,

797
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,340
 I declare it over you because I'm saying

798
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,180
 this is now who you are.

799
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,780
 Uproot the broken names.

800
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,860
 You are not a failure, you are my son.

801
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,740
 My daughter's name is Mia Lynn Gardner.

802
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,320
 What a beautiful name.

803
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,500
 Her last name, Gardner, funnily enough, is my last name.

804
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,100
 And it links her to incredible English heritage

805
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,380
 that goes all the way back to Prince Michael of Kent.

806
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,700
 Well, it doesn't, but hey.

807
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,900
 Lynn is my wife's mother's first name.

808
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,900
 And we named her that because we wanted her name

809
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,460
 to take her back to her New Zealand family

810
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,420
 and the years and years of heritage and legacy she has

811
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,700
 from those from New Zealand.

812
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,100
 Mia is Latin for mine.

813
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,260
 It was Chris and I who had struggled to have children

814
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,540
 say over this girl, she is mine.

815
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,340
 Could you imagine what it would be like for Mia

816
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,420
 who has been adopted?

817
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,080
 Mia who was once in an institution,

818
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,080
 who didn't actually have a family,

819
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,740
 for us to come along and say,

820
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,420
 we know what your name is right now,

821
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,860
 but we're giving you a new name.

822
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,340
 We're actually declaring the end right here

823
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,180
 at the beginning.

824
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,700
 Your name is Mia because you're mine.

825
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,460
 You're no longer abandoned.

826
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,240
 You're no longer left alone.

827
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,100
 You're no longer gonna be in an institution.

828
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,180
 You have a family and that family has heritage and legacy,

829
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,380
 importance and name, and you are a child.

830
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,140
 And every time we say your name, Mia,

831
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,780
 it's like we're re-declaring that you are mine,

832
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,220
 that you are not abandoned anymore.

833
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,140
 Every time Mia says her name,

834
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,040
 it's her way also of aligning to the new destiny

835
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,880
 that she's in.

836
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,940
 It's her way of saying these parents are mine.

837
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,320
 This family is mine.

838
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,700
 These people are mine.

839
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,060
 We broke that wrong identity over her

840
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,020
 and gave her a new name.

841
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,200
 In fact, in her crib, I wanna show you a photo.

842
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,060
 This is her crib at the institution where she was.

843
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,820
 We put a sign up saying, my new name is Mia.

844
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,700
 Because I am someone's now.

845
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,660
 What are the names that you're carrying around you

846
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,580
 that are not of God,

847
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,060
 that is your brokenness speaking to you

848
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,820
 and forming who you think you are

849
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,960
 when actually God has something for you?

850
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,760
 I know I've gone a bit longer, but I really,

851
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,580
 this is a very important word for me to share.

852
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,140
 I hope you understand that.

853
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,220
 And it's important for us as a church to be with.

854
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,460
 And I wanna just take two more minutes

855
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,580
 to finish with one more scripture.

856
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,740
 Is that okay?

857
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,100
 'Cause I wanna give you a practical way

858
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,640
 that you can begin to rename yourself this week.

859
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,420
 A practical way for you to hear the mouth of God

860
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,060
 say something new over you that has the power

861
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,180
 to uproot whatever failure, I'm not good enough,

862
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,180
 I'm not attractive, I'm not whatever it might be

863
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,980
 that's going on in your life.

864
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,600
 This is taken from Revelations chapter two,

865
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,960
 Jesus speaking to the church at the end of all things.

866
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,040
 Notice what he says.

867
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
 He says, "Those who have ears to hear,

868
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,720
 let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

869
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,480
 To those who have overcome,

870
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,820
 I will give some of the hidden manna.

871
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,960
 I will also give them a white stone

872
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,560
 with a new name written on it,

873
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,280
 known only to them who receives it."

874
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,640
 I love this idea that Jesus would say

875
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,880
 at the end of all things,

876
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,080
 he's going to give us a white stone.

877
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,920
 It's a stone because it is indestructible,

878
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,560
 symbolizing eternity, and it's white

879
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,040
 because it's the righteousness and the glory of Christ,

880
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,800
 his salvation and cleanliness in us.

881
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,720
 And he says, "I'm gonna give you a white stone,

882
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,040
 and on that white stone, I'm gonna write a name on it,

883
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,220
 and this is a new name that I have for you.

884
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,800
 It's unique to you, I'm not giving it to anybody else.

885
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,640
 This is a name that you need to know."

886
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,020
 Why is it unique to us?

887
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,240
 Because every single one of us

888
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,160
 has uniquely been formed by the enemy,

889
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,260
 uniquely shaped by the broken words spoken into our lives

890
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,800
 over however many years it is that we've been alive.

891
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,080
 And so the unique name that comes from God

892
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,680
 is the opposite of how the enemy has tried to form us.

893
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
 And at the end of all things,

894
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,000
 he's going to give us that name that will reject,

895
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,720
 turn away, uproot all of that brokenness,

896
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,320
 and say, "You have overcome.

897
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,020
 You can come into eternity with me.

898
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,280
 Know this unique name that I give you now

899
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,240
 for the destiny that you have, eternity in me."

900
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,400
 Here's the practical thing I want you to do.

901
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,880
 Every single one of you, hopefully, as you came in today,

902
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,520
 were given a white stone.

903
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
 You're probably like, "What is that about?"

904
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,120
 If you didn't get one on the way out,

905
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,560
 you can grab one on the way out.

906
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,880
 But these white stones,

907
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,200
 I want you to do something very practical this week.

908
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,840
 I want you to put this somewhere

909
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,640
 where you're gonna see it every day.

910
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,760
 It might be by your computer at work.

911
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
 That's a great place to put it.

912
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,040
 No one's gonna come by your desk and go,

913
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,680
 "Why do you have a white stone on your,

914
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
 like, white stones just will be invisible

915
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,000
 to everybody else."

916
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,880
 But you'll put it on your desk,

917
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,040
 or maybe you'll put it by your mirror in your bathroom,

918
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,840
 or maybe you'll put it on your living room,

919
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,120
 like a cupboard or a sideboard or something like that.

920
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,480
 But as you put the white stone there,

921
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,400
 here's what you're doing.

922
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,840
 You're reminding yourself that you carry names

923
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,040
 that you don't want to carry anymore.

924
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,500
 Remember, the starting point for Israel

925
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,640
 was that very thought,

926
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,760
 "Oh, I'm carrying some honest names

927
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,680
 that I don't want anymore."

928
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,040
 The white stone is a reminder to you

929
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,400
 that you carry those names,

930
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,240
 and it's an invitation to you to be honest about them.

931
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,640
 I've been honest about mine

932
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,360
 in front of 700 people here today.

933
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,440
 Would you be honest about yours before Jesus?

934
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,060
 And as you're honest about your name,

935
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,320
 the white stones are a reminder to you

936
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,300
 that you have a new name.

937
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,860
 And as well as letting God know the names,

938
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,980
 the broken names that you're carrying,

939
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,200
 may you then open your ears to hear the new names

940
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,640
 that He wants to give you that day,

941
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,360
 and say, "You're not a failure.

942
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,880
 You're my child, and I love you.

943
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,280
 And with you, I am well pleased."

944
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,940
 If we're gonna see the new thing that God is doing in us,

945
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,040
 we need to recognize that there's a broken identity

946
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,760
 that all of us battle with,

947
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,880
 that there is this difference

948
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
 between who we are in Christ Jesus

949
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,560
 and who we've come to believe we are through our brokenness,

950
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,360
 and God can change the trajectory.

951
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,020
 I pray you take this word and really, really take it to heart

952
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,580
 and allow the Holy Spirit to do some beautiful work in you.

953
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,700
 Would you stand with me?

954
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,940
 And I wanna pray for you.

955
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,980
 And maybe if you're comfortable, you can open your hands.

956
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:30,660
 And I know, again, we've gone a little bit longer,

957
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,660
 but I want you just to take some time now

958
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,780
 not to rush this bit.

959
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,020
 This bit's the most important part, actually,

960
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,680
 as we spend some time with Christ Jesus,

961
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,980
 as we spend some time with the Holy Spirit,

962
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,060
 as we think about the white stone in our hands,

963
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:52,140
 as we're honest about some of the names

964
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,300
 that we know we hold,

965
00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:00,380
 and as we listen afresh to the truth of God,

966
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,560
 speak over the lies of the enemy.

967
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,260
 You are not forsaken.

968
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,520
 You are not a betrayer.

969
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,780
 You are not a failure.

970
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,300
 You are not a herder of people.

971
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,560
 You are not a liar.

972
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,020
 You are not what your teacher said about you.

973
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,380
 You are not what that person said.

974
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,000
 You are not what your ex-whatever said to you.

975
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,860
 You are not what those test results might say to you.

976
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,100
 You are and always will be only what Jesus Christ

977
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,940
 says to you.

978
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,100
 Through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus,

979
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,240
 he names you my son, my daughter.

980
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,320
 With you, I am well pleased.

981
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,800
 Lord, I pray you would uproot today and this week

982
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,360
 names that have long held us captive

983
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,560
 to the slavery of our soul,

984
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,840
 and I pray, Lord, you would release us

985
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,140
 to a new season of hope, a new season of life.

986
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,060
 Lord, I pray that you would bring a name

987
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,680
 that is the opposite of the name

988
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,440
 that the people in this room are carrying.

989
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,920
 Lord, I pray that it would free them

990
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,160
 from the weight of burden, the weight of expectancy,

991
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,040
 the weight of feeling like a failure.

992
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,720
 Lord, I pray you would release people

993
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,480
 into a new destiny that is only shaped by you,

994
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,860
 that your mouth would bestow the name they need to hear.

995
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,420
 Father, we need this for our city.

996
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,340
 We need this for us.

997
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,800
 We need this for our workplaces, for our families.

998
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,960
 Release your church to a new name, Lord.

999
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,240
 Take some time.

1000
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,420
 We're gonna have a prayer team in a moment

1001
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,860
 available for you, and we'll stand and we'll pray with you.

1002
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,440
 If you would like prayer in a moment

1003
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,900
 after the service finishes, please come forward for prayer,

1004
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,780
 'cause I know for some of you,

1005
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,280
 this is important to take the time to do this,

1006
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,620
 but for all of us, let's now just take a moment

1007
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,700
 to respond in worship, and allow this worship time

1008
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,060
 to be a time for you to ask the Holy Spirit,

1009
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,420
 what are some of these names I'm carrying, Lord?

1010
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,300
 What are some of the things

1011
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,400
 that you want me to lay before you today?

1012
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,980
 (gentle music)

1013
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,400
 (soft music)
