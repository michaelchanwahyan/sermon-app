1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Well, Chris and I were facing a big decision.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,200
 Do we stay put in the US where I was serving as a bishop

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,900
 and Chris and I were involved in training pastors

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,560
 and congregational leaders,

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,760
 or do we step out in faith

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
 toward a dream we had when we got married?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,460
 A dream to be involved in church

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,320
 and marketplace ministry in mainland China.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
 Now, we were settled.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,800
 Our son, who'd been in Chinese school in Taiwan,

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,160
 loved his American school.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,880
 "No homework," he announced gleefully

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,080
 on the second day of school.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,460
 We'd bought a house.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,720
 We were learning how to manage our lawn and garden

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,280
 so the neighbors wouldn't complain.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,380
 We had two cars, a four-bedroom house on a half-acre lot

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,480
 with a nicely finished basement

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,900
 for our son and his buddies to hang out.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,840
 We were living the American dream,

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,840
 but we had another dream, and it didn't go away.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,340
 When Chris read the news

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,900
 about the Olympics coming to Beijing,

24
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,740
 she felt God saying it was time for us to go to China.

25
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,900
 Now, right after we got married, we moved to Hong Kong.

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,800
 We were here during the spring of 1989

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,200
 when hope for change, for reform and opening

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,960
 was literally in the air and on campuses

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,960
 and on the streets across China and also here in Hong Kong.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,120
 But sadly, that dream had to be postponed.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,720
 Now, the Olympic Games would be coming to Beijing

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,280
 20 years later, and the whole world would be watching.

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,620
 Chris had been born in China,

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,380
 but came with her family to Hong Kong

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,940
 as refugees when she was just a child.

36
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:02,160
 Could this be the time for us to move to China?

37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,600
 Would we be free to practice and celebrate

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,320
 and share our faith in China?

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,140
 This felt like a moment of great hope,

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,080
 but we really needed to hear from God

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
 to have his affirmation of our dream.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,020
 We really needed wisdom and discernment,

43
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,660
 and that's what we're talking about today.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,800
 It is time to dream again,

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,480
 but we really need wisdom and discernment as we dream.

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,780
 You, like Chris and me, may be facing some big decisions

47
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,360
 that affect not only you,

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,940
 but your family and other people as well.

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,640
 You need a lot of wisdom to make the right decision.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,420
 How can I be sure that my dream is really from God?

51
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,420
 Maybe it's just my dream and not God's dream for me.

52
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:08,540
 And what if mine is an impossible dream,

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,740
 far beyond my own ability or resources?

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,140
 For these and other questions that you are facing,

55
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,380
 today's passage from 1 Kings 3

56
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,100
 will offer you encouragement and insight.

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,100
 It will provide some wisdom and discernment.

58
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,340
 So let's read together.

59
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,260
 At Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon

60
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,700
 during the night in a dream, and God said,

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,660
 "Ask for whatever you want.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,860
 "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."

63
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,060
 What a fabulous dream.

64
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,140
 God offers you anything you want.

65
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,380
 I don't know about you, but I think I might say to God,

66
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,200
 "Please bring this pandemic to an end in the next month."

67
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,640
 What did Solomon say?

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,680
 "You have shown great kindness to your servant,

69
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,520
 "my father David, because he was faithful and righteous

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
 "and upright in heart.

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,200
 "You've continued this great kindness to him

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,140
 "and have given him a son."

73
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,620
 That would be me, Solomon,

74
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,800
 "to sit on his throne this very day."

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,440
 Now, I need to give you a little context.

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,300
 When Solomon had this dream, he was about 15 years old

77
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,520
 and was just becoming king after the death of his father.

78
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,820
 When was this?

79
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,760
 Well, this was about 3,000 years ago.

80
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,800
 This was the time of the ancient Zhou Dynasty here in China,

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
 and there were also flourishing civilizations in India,

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,860
 in Egypt, Middle America.

83
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,420
 Who exactly was Solomon?

84
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,340
 King David's son, yes,

85
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,340
 but David had many wives and many sons.

86
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,460
 Bathsheba was his mother.

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,900
 Does that ring a bell?

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,740
 Bathsheba was the granddaughter of one of David's closest

89
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,980
 and most trusted advisors.

90
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,460
 Now, listen carefully

91
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,460
 because the story gets a little messy here.

92
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,320
 Bathsheba became King David's wife

93
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,040
 after he raped her and got her pregnant.

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,940
 She was a married woman.

95
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,080
 And then David arranged for the murder of her husband

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,340
 so he could legally marry Bathsheba.

97
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,080
 Now, David eventually repented.

98
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
 You can read this repentance in Psalm 51.

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,800
 But he paid big time for his sin

100
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,180
 in the lives of his children and also politically.

101
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,560
 David had a lot of sons,

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
 and the transition to Solomon becoming king

103
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
 did not happen with a lot of turmoil and bloodshed,

104
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,220
 but that's for another day.

105
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,160
 As you can see, the Bible doesn't hide the flaws

106
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,660
 of its leaders and heroes.

107
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,320
 We know the best and the worst of King David.

108
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,520
 And we also learn about the sins of some of his sons,

109
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,500
 including Solomon, but I'm getting ahead of the story.

110
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,800
 Solomon is still a teenager,

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,920
 and he seems to have only respect for his dad

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,760
 who has already passed away.

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,160
 He was faithful to you.

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,420
 He was righteous, upright in heart.

115
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,920
 Well, a filial exaggeration for sure.

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,920
 But maybe, just maybe Solomon hasn't yet learned

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,840
 the shocking truth about how his mother

118
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,500
 became King David's wife.

119
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,480
 You know, he's only 15.

120
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,220
 As a young boy in the royal family,

121
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,220
 Solomon may well have been protected by his mother

122
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,740
 from all the pain and violence there had been in his family

123
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,240
 since his father's sordid affair.

124
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,920
 Even as a teenager, Solomon is soon going to learn

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,600
 that God did forgive David

126
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,040
 when he sincerely and deeply repented.

127
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,340
 And God did bless David in spite of what we might think of

128
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,700
 as unforgivable sins.

129
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,240
 But teenagers have dreams.

130
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,760
 Some of you are teenagers,

131
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,640
 and you are dreaming of a world better

132
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,000
 than the one we are giving you.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Lord, have mercy on us older folks.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And keep dreaming, young people.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,780
 We need you to help us build a better world.

136
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,200
 So Solomon has this amazing dream.

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,080
 God is offering him anything he wants.

138
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,980
 How to choose?

139
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,320
 Wealth, long life, beautiful women, power, fame?

140
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,140
 Let's see what Solomon chose.

141
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,880
 Now, Lord God, you have made your servant King

142
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,400
 in place of my father David.

143
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 But I'm only a little child.

144
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,160
 I do not know how to carry out my duties.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,320
 Your servant is here among the people you have chosen,

146
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,200
 a great people, too numerous to count or number.

147
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,160
 So give your servant a discerning heart

148
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,200
 to govern your people and to distinguish

149
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,960
 between right and wrong.

150
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,960
 For who is able to govern this great people of yours?

151
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,120
 Now, remember in Solomon's dream,

152
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
 he could have anything he wanted.

153
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,160
 He could have wealth, fame, or power.

154
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,240
 Instead, the teenager who is becoming King

155
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,100
 humbly recognized his youth and immaturity.

156
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,440
 I'm too young.

157
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,940
 I'm just a child.

158
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,520
 There's no way I can handle this job.

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,560
 Too many people.

160
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,560
 So give me a heart sensitive to you.

161
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,880
 And give me the ability to govern all these people wisely.

162
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 Give me a clear moral compass to discern

163
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,760
 between right and wrong.

164
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,880
 What is true and lasting?

165
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,720
 And what is short term and soon to be forgotten?

166
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,840
 Help me to choose what is best.

167
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,720
 In his dream, Solomon listened to God.

168
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,680
 He chose wisdom over wealth.

169
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,800
 He chose justice over power.

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,520
 He chose being right over being famous.

171
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,840
 He chose the good of the people

172
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,540
 rather than his own success.

173
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,060
 We are beginning to dream again, aren't we?

174
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,360
 Even though we're entering the third year of the pandemic

175
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,600
 without a clear way out, we want to stop waiting.

176
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,480
 We want to make some important decisions

177
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,280
 and we want to hear from God.

178
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,240
 I know you're following our Dreaming Again devotionals

179
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,480
 that come out at 6 a.m. every day.

180
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,560
 I had the privilege of helping to put these together

181
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,720
 and to read them before you got to read them.

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,600
 These devotionals will help you dream again.

183
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
 And they continue for a week after our fast ends

184
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,560
 next Sunday.

185
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,120
 So what are your dreams at the beginning of 2022?

186
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,160
 I'll tell you how my nephew Hugo in New York City

187
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,860
 was dreaming before Martin Luther King's birthday last week.

188
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,960
 I have a dream that one day I won't wear a mask anymore.

189
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,140
 Are you dreaming along with Hugo?

190
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,440
 Are you dreaming of traveling again?

191
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,360
 Are you dreaming of a promotion,

192
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,020
 of getting your finances in better shape?

193
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,920
 Are you dreaming of finally getting married

194
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,220
 or of having a baby?

195
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,440
 In that order, please.

196
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,080
 Are you dreaming of success in sports

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,640
 or as a singer or a musician or actor,

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,880
 as a writer or dancer or a pastor?

199
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,680
 Are you dreaming of getting into a good university

200
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,960
 here in Hong Kong, overseas?

201
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:37,120
 Does your dream have to do with God's plan for your life?

202
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,240
 Or is it mainly about your success?

203
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,720
 Is your dream self-centered or is it about other people,

204
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,020
 helping them to flourish?

205
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,760
 In your dream, do you get ahead

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,440
 by taking advantage of others,

207
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,000
 by putting other people down?

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
 Or does your dream put you in partnership with others,

209
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,560
 bringing out the best in them and in you?

210
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,340
 Does your dream require you to bend or break the rules,

211
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,920
 to dishonor the name of Christ?

212
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,440
 Is there anything about your dream

213
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,840
 that you are ashamed to talk about?

214
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,940
 We need great wisdom and clear discernment

215
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,780
 and dreams need to be tested.

216
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,740
 These days, I'm part of a men's community group

217
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,020
 that is wrestling with the challenge of dreaming again.

218
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,720
 Each week, we talk about the sermon

219
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,660
 and also about a right now video by John Maxwell

220
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,160
 called "Put Your Dream to the Test."

221
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,140
 Now, Maxwell is helping us guys discern

222
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,160
 between wise and foolish dreams.

223
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,260
 Is yours a daydream, just a distraction from your work?

224
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,380
 Is it pie in the sky, wild ideas with no strategy,

225
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,980
 no basis in reality?

226
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,660
 Maybe yours is a bad dream.

227
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,660
 It breeds fear and paralysis.

228
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,100
 Or an idealistic dream.

229
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,720
 This is the way the world would be

230
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,440
 if I were in charge of the world.

231
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,580
 Vicarious dreams, dreams lived out through others.

232
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,700
 Maybe yours is a romantic dream,

233
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,020
 the belief that some person is gonna make you happy

234
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,020
 or career dream, career success will make me happy.

235
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,740
 A destination dream that maybe some position, title, award

236
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,020
 will make me happy.

237
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,020
 Material dreams that wealth and possessions

238
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,500
 will make you happy.

239
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,660
 Well, we need to seek wisdom and discernment.

240
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,180
 We need to test our dreams with our community group,

241
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,780
 with others who know us well,

242
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,740
 who are willing to ask us hard questions,

243
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,740
 to pray with us, to help us discern a wise way

244
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,360
 to achieve our dreams.

245
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,860
 Also, we need to look for God's wisdom

246
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,860
 and Jesus, the Bible tells us, is the wisdom of God.

247
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,260
 Now, what exactly does that mean for our dreams?

248
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,740
 Paul tells us that Christ's crucifixion,

249
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,160
 which proved to the Jews that Jesus could definitely

250
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,060
 not be God's Messiah, and which the Greeks dismissed

251
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,260
 as something totally absurd, the cross, Paul says,

252
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,700
 is actually a demonstration of the power of God

253
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,400
 and the wisdom of God.

254
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,020
 For, Paul says, the foolishness of God

255
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,940
 is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God

256
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,700
 is stronger than human strength.

257
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:09,820
 To have God's wisdom as we dream means having the cross

258
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:16,020
 of Christ at the very center of our dreams.

259
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,280
 Am I willing to dream in the shadow of the cross?

260
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,080
 Am I willing to lay down my selfish desires

261
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,660
 and take up the cross to put God's kingdom,

262
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,940
 the wisdom and values of Jesus, front and center

263
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,040
 in my dream?

264
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,280
 In his dream as a teenager, Solomon made the right choices,

265
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,140
 but spoiler alert, he didn't always do that

266
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,660
 for the rest of his life.

267
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,640
 So, how did God respond to Solomon's choice?

268
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,260
 The Lord was pleased that Solomon asked for this,

269
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,540
 for wisdom, discernment, so God said to him,

270
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,740
 "Since you have asked for this, and not for long life

271
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,920
 "or wealth for yourself, nor you've asked for the death

272
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,480
 "of your enemies, but for discernment

273
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,200
 "and administering justice, I will do what you have asked.

274
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,700
 "I will give you a wise and discerning heart

275
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,060
 "so that there'll never be anyone like you,

276
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,380
 "nor ever again.

277
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,600
 "Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for,

278
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 "both wealth and honor, so that in your lifetime,

279
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 "you'll have no equal.

280
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,200
 "And if you walk in obedience to me

281
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,100
 "and keep my decrees and commands as David, your father did,

282
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,880
 "I'll give you a long life."

283
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,880
 Then Solomon awoke and he realized it was just a dream.

284
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:55,200
 But God did give Solomon a wise and discerning heart.

285
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,700
 Solomon is remembered as a wise king who wrote

286
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,220
 or compiled more than 3,000 proverbs

287
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,740
 and composed more than 1,000 songs,

288
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,520
 some of which are in the Hebrew Bible, our Old Testament.

289
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,880
 People came from all around the region

290
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,120
 to hear from Solomon.

291
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,120
 And God gave Solomon the wealth and honor

292
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,160
 he did not ask for.

293
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,040
 Solomon expanded the kingdom his father David

294
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,320
 had established.

295
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,320
 He built a magnificent temple to worship one God.

296
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,500
 Solomon's reputation spread into Africa.

297
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,720
 And he was visited by the queen of Ethiopia,

298
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,440
 who is believed to have taken the worship of God

299
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,040
 back to her home country.

300
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,120
 A vibrant worship tradition that continues

301
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,020
 to this day in Ethiopia.

302
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,380
 As was the custom for kings at the time,

303
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,520
 Solomon had many wives.

304
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,720
 And here the story gets a little complicated.

305
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,360
 Remember that in the dream, God had a condition

306
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
 for the blessings he would give Solomon.

307
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,520
 If, if you walk,

308
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,520
 if you walk in obedience to me and keep my commands,

309
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,460
 that's the big if.

310
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,880
 The problem is Solomon didn't always

311
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,400
 remember that condition.

312
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,860
 Solomon's marriages were to women from royal families

313
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,340
 in the various kingdoms in the region.

314
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,600
 Marriages like this were part of foreign relations

315
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,680
 at the time, a way to secure peace and prosperity.

316
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,860
 These women were, we might say ambassadors.

317
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,920
 But here Solomon gradually lost his way.

318
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,040
 He, he cared so much for these wives

319
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,180
 and the fame and influence that they brought him,

320
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,640
 that he provided temples in Jerusalem

321
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,520
 for them to worship their own gods.

322
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,480
 A temple, temple's not too far from God's temple.

323
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,700
 And Solomon's heart gradually drifted away

324
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,160
 from the God of Israel.

325
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 He, he was seduced by his love for his many wives

326
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,500
 to join them in worshiping idols.

327
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,220
 He did not stay true to God

328
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,260
 as he was challenged in the dream.

329
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,120
 And consequently, after his death,

330
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,620
 the kingdom became divided.

331
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,240
 It was never again united.

332
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,540
 Eventually the kingdom was completely destroyed.

333
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,540
 Sad, sad, so very sad.

334
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,180
 Solomon began well as a teenaged king,

335
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,140
 but he did not end well.

336
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,220
 Instead of becoming wiser,

337
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,060
 he gradually became more selfish and decadent.

338
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,420
 His success went to his head.

339
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,680
 He began to believe in his own wisdom

340
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,220
 rather than trusting God's wisdom.

341
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,380
 And he made foolish, tragic decisions.

342
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,180
 He ended his reign with great wealth and fame,

343
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,580
 but in spiritual disgrace.

344
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,280
 Solomon received wisdom and discernment as a gift of God

345
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,920
 when he began his reign as a king.

346
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,560
 But why did he lose that wisdom?

347
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:22,560
 How could he build such a marvelous temple

348
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,560
 and then begin worshiping other gods?

349
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,600
 What happened to his wisdom and his discernment?

350
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,700
 Well, there's a lesson here for us as we dream again

351
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,300
 and as we follow our dreams.

352
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,160
 Allow God to shape your dream,

353
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,300
 not only at the beginning,

354
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,300
 but follow him very carefully as you live out your dream.

355
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,320
 Don't allow your dream to be clouded by selfish ambition.

356
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,960
 Don't allow success to corrupt you.

357
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,640
 Don't let your success cause you to believe

358
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,960
 that you have made it on your own,

359
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,360
 that you don't really need God anymore.

360
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,360
 As you dream, don't succumb to the temptation to play God.

361
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,480
 But this is not easy.

362
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,180
 How to be a journalist in the new Hong Kong,

363
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:31,000
 to be wise as a snake, but harmless as a dove.

364
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,860
 How to raise children with Jesus values

365
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,600
 when schools teach something different.

366
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,960
 How to honor God as I manage the financial

367
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,400
 and other material resources God has entrusted to me.

368
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,540
 How to be a disciple of Jesus in a culture

369
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,540
 that focuses on pleasure and immediate gratification.

370
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,120
 How to grow in God's wisdom as I get higher education,

371
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,760
 more advanced degrees.

372
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,760
 How to integrate the knowledge and expertise of science

373
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,360
 with the wisdom of God.

374
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,320
 And how to avoid the tragedy of Solomon.

375
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,120
 To have the wisdom and discernment to stay the course.

376
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,520
 To be true to God and his dream for our lives

377
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,400
 month after month, year after year.

378
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,760
 I used to fly a small plane.

379
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,680
 I depended on three forms of wisdom or guidance

380
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,240
 to keep me on course throughout my journey.

381
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,680
 A map that showed the area I was flying over,

382
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,440
 including mountains and other obstacles.

383
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,880
 I needed secondly, a compass and an altimeter

384
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
 that showed me direction and altitude.

385
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,460
 And then I had a radio that allowed me to communicate

386
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,480
 with air traffic controllers, a community of experts

387
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,880
 who could see all the planes in the air around me.

388
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,600
 With these three points of reference,

389
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,080
 I could be sure of reaching my destination safely.

390
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,720
 I like to think of the map as the Bible.

391
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,320
 The compass and altimeter is God's spirit

392
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,780
 and air traffic control as the church.

393
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,040
 For true wisdom and clear discernment, we need all three.

394
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,260
 We need the word of God, the spirit of God,

395
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,300
 the people of God.

396
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,300
 The word of God, bathe your mind and heart in scripture

397
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:47,520
 and find a new way to do it when you get bored.

398
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,440
 This past year, I was listening my way through the Bible

399
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,120
 with Nikki Gumbel and David Suchet.

400
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,040
 The Bible in one year app.

401
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,080
 For you, it will be something different.

402
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,080
 The word of God, remember is sharp as a surgeon's scalpel,

403
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,840
 cutting through everything, whether doubt or defense,

404
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,420
 laying us open to listen and obey.

405
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,160
 That's Hebrews 4.12.

406
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,200
 We need not only the word of God, we need the spirit of God.

407
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,640
 Being in constant touch with God's spirit

408
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,720
 will help you grow through your experience.

409
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,720
 Become a practical scientist, learn from your experience.

410
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,420
 So you don't keep making the same mistakes

411
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,100
 over and over again.

412
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,380
 Believe me, I've been there, done that.

413
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,880
 Like they say, insanity is doing the same thing

414
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,540
 over and over and expecting different results.

415
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,280
 And thirdly, we not only keep in touch with the spirit,

416
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,760
 but we also need to be in touch with the people of God.

417
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,600
 Join a community group if you're not already a part.

418
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,120
 Find a mentor, a spiritual friend,

419
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,120
 someone you can be open and honest with

420
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,120
 who will both love and challenge you to grow.

421
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,640
 Do you have a soul friend who knows you inside out?

422
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,680
 Reach out to us at the Vine, we'll help you find a fit.

423
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,000
 So keep tuned to the word of God, the spirit of God,

424
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,360
 the people of God.

425
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,280
 If you do, you will have the wisdom and discernment

426
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,280
 both to dream and to carry out your dream,

427
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,040
 to bring it to completion.

428
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,080
 As for Chris and me, you probably guessed

429
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,400
 that we did pursue God's dream for us in China.

430
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,160
 After a lot of prayer and counsel from friends

431
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,120
 and family members, we went to live and work in Shanghai

432
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,120
 for quite a few years before God brought us back to Hong Kong

433
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,800
 where we started our marriage 34 years before.

434
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,840
 Did we always make wise decisions along the way?

435
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,120
 No, we didn't always get it right.

436
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,540
 We sometimes stumbled and fell.

437
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,780
 We had many opportunities to grow through our mistakes,

438
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,220
 to fail forward as the saying goes.

439
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,280
 But we have continued to follow Jesus

440
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,000
 and to pursue God's dream for our lives,

441
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,200
 our careers and our marriage.

442
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,200
 And now along with you, we are dreaming again.

443
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,040
 I like this children's song.

444
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,960
 ♪ I am a promise ♪

445
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
 ♪ I am a possibility ♪

446
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,840
 ♪ I am a promise with a capital P ♪

447
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,840
 ♪ I am a great big bundle of potentiality ♪

448
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,560
 ♪ And I am learning to hear God's voice ♪

449
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,800
 ♪ And I am trying to make the right choice ♪

450
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:11,800
 ♪ I am a promise to be anything God wants me to be ♪

451
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,780
 Not anything I want to be,

452
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,320
 not anything others want me to be,

453
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,860
 anything God wants me to be.

454
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,080
 It's what God wants me to be

455
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,080
 that will give clarity, wisdom and perseverance

456
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,300
 to my dream.

457
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,440
 So we need wisdom and discernment

458
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,720
 to make the right choices day after day,

459
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,240
 month after month, year after year.

460
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,760
 And if we lack wisdom, we can ask God

461
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,760
 who gives to us generously without finding fault, James 1:5.

462
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,720
 I love the way Paul describes our dreaming

463
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,240
 in alignment with the wisdom of God.

464
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,060
 This resurrection life you receive from God

465
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,640
 is not a timid, grave-tending life.

466
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,980
 It's adventurously expectant,

467
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,400
 greeting God with a child like, "What's next, Papa?"

468
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,760
 God's spirit touches our spirits

469
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,600
 and confirms who we really are.

470
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,320
 We know who he is and we know who we are,

471
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,300
 father and children.

472
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,800
 And we know we're going to get what's coming to us,

473
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,840
 an unbelievable inheritance.

474
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,080
 That's what it means to dream again

475
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,700
 with the wisdom and discernment of God's spirit.

476
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,700
 We discover our unbelievable inheritance with God.

477
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,620
 So what's next, Papa?

478
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:09,060
 Right now, I invite you to lift up your dreams

479
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,460
 to Father God as we pray.

480
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,940
 Would you do that?

481
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,940
 Would you lift up your dreams to our Father?

482
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:25,980
 Thank you, Abba, Papa,

483
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,740
 for helping us to dream again,

484
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,180
 for helping us to connect with the unbelievable inheritance

485
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,540
 you have for us, your children.

486
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,300
 Thank you, Jesus, for your wisdom come into our world.

487
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,600
 Help us as we dream again

488
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,620
 to discern and choose what is best

489
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,100
 so we grow up in every way to Christ and his wisdom.

490
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,420
 Help us become big people who love you passionately

491
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,060
 and love our neighbors as ourselves

492
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,200
 and help us to become expressions of your wisdom

493
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,660
 in our homes, our schools, our offices,

494
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,460
 in our work and in our play,

495
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,180
 in our art and in our science,

496
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:17,020
 in our worship and also in our politics.

497
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,020
 Fill our dreams with the joy of your spirit's presence,

498
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,500
 with the hope of your unbelievable inheritance,

499
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,060
 with the healing that will sustain us

500
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,940
 through this pandemic.

501
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,820
 In the name and wisdom of Jesus,

502
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,820
 we dream and we pray.

503
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,380
 Amen.

504
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,960
 (gentle music)

505
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,540
 (gentle music)
