[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.120]   It's so good to be with you.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.120]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.880]   If you're new to the Vine, if you're new online, welcome.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.520]   We're so glad that you found the YouTube link
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.120]   somewhere, somehow, and that you're with us.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.480]   If you're here in this room, I'm so glad that you found
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.880]   29 Burroughs Street, somehow, somewhere, you're here.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.720]   If you meant to go to the Baptist Church next door,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.200]   we love the fact that you're here as well.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.120]   Welcome.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.440]   As we continue our series in Psalm 23,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.120]   we do so today by looking at perhaps
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.120]   the single most famous verse of that Psalm.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.760]   The most famous Psalm that we have in all of our scriptures,
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.840]   this is the most famous verse of that Psalm.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280]   You would have heard this verse spoken many times before,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.320]   perhaps read it, seen it in movies.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.400]   Let me read it to us once more.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.520]   It says this, "Even though I walk through the valley
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.360]   "of the shadow of death."
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.080]   I'll say that again for us.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.880]   "Even though I walk through the valley
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   "of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240]   "for you are with me.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.920]   "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.760]   I've been saying throughout this series
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.540]   what an incredible poet David is.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.040]   In fact, this whole Psalm is a beautiful,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.260]   structured, ancient Near Eastern poem.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.880]   And we've seen in the last few weeks
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.520]   the kind of poetry that he's brought to us,
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.000]   the imagery he's brought to us, it's been amazing.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.520]   It's been talking about God being a shepherd,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.320]   kind of trying to align our ideas
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.000]   to the fact that God is not this angry schoolmaster
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.240]   or God's not some ethereal thing up in the clouds somewhere,
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.680]   but he's like a shepherd present in our lives.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680]   He told us already that because he's our shepherd,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.800]   we lack no good thing.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.920]   There's nothing in our lives that we lack.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.080]   He is abundant in his blessing to us.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.440]   And he's described what some of those blessings look like.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.860]   He's told us about green pastures,
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.600]   that God will lead us to places that will be abundant
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.120]   for our strength and for our life.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120]   He's told us about quiet waters,
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.960]   that God will take us to places that will chill us out,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.800]   restore us, give us what we need to survive in life.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.080]   He's talked about paths of righteousness,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.200]   that God will lead us into places
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.400]   where we'll come to understand his righteousness
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.440]   in our lives, that we would know we're also righteous,
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.380]   not in our own strength, but in him.
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.200]   I mean, all that David has done so far in this Psalm
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.320]   has shown us everything that we can say amen to,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.580]   the kind of life we want to live.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.860]   I don't know about you, but I want green pastures.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.220]   I want quiet waters.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.340]   I want my soul restored.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.660]   I wanna lean into the blessings and the goodness of God.
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.980]   And then he gets to verse four,
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.060]   and David does a U-turn on us.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.340]   He suddenly goes, "Oh, and by the way,
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.900]   if God's gonna lead you, guess where he'll also lead you?
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.460]   To valleys that are like shadows of death over you."
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.140]   And when you're reading this Psalm
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.500]   and you're tracking along with the poetic nature of it,
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.100]   you're all like, you're on a high
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.340]   thinking how amazing God is with green pastures.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.100]   And then David sort of takes the rug
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.300]   and pulls it out from under us.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.740]   And he says, "You wanna know what life is also like?
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.420]   Oh, we all want to lie down in green pastures.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.580]   We all want that lovely quiet water.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.820]   We all want the bonus at the end of the year
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.340]   that we've worked really hard on.
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.880]   We all want the relationship that we're in to work out.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.320]   We all want to find that perfect spouse for us
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.160]   for the rest of our lives, whatever it might be.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.520]   We want the green pastures."
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.440]   But David is telling us
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.640]   that there's another kind of season of life.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.680]   That if you think as a Christian,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.440]   your whole life is gonna be dedicated to only green pastures
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.080]   then you need to wake up.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.400]   In fact, he's using the poetic structure here
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.520]   to wake the reader up,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.080]   to kind of subvert the feeling that he had placed in them.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.200]   And he's saying this, "Guys, you need to understand.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.420]   Yes, there will be times of greatness,
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.760]   times of blessing, times of abundance,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.540]   but there's also gonna be times of struggle
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.240]   and hardship and pain,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.420]   times where it's gonna feel like you're in the shadow
[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.340]   of the valley of death."
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.300]   David's saying, "You gotta understand the seasons
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.540]   that you're in in life."
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.720]   And we've just come through the last three years
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.560]   here in Hong Kong.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.700]   We're like, we know that season, right?
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.860]   Like every single one of us in this room,
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.020]   we know what it is to suffer.
[00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.100]   We know pain, we know hardship.
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.820]   We know what it was to go through the process,
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.180]   the time to go through COVID,
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.140]   the restrictions that are still upon us now,
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.500]   the struggles with travel, the disruption of family.
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.980]   And when we've all felt like we've been in a valley
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.380]   of the shadow of death, perhaps, over the last three years.
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.380]   And David is writing this Psalm in a valley of death himself
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.940]   as he's literally writing Psalm 23,
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.600]   his own son, Absalom, is trying to kill him,
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.340]   trying to track him down and kill him.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.700]   So David has fled from the safety of his home
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.460]   into the Judean wilderness,
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.900]   and he's now hiding in dark caves.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.860]   So when he writes, "I," this idea that God leads us
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.580]   in the valleys of shadows of death,
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.860]   it's basically David saying, "I know what that feels like
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.260]   'cause I'm in that place right now."
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.660]   There's pain there.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.860]   And if you're in this room and you're in a place
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.780]   of the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.060]   then the good news is you're in good company
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.300]   with the rest of humanity.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.340]   And don't fall for the lie
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.260]   that just because you believe in Jesus,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.900]   your life is gonna be suddenly all green pastures.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.800]   Come on, church.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.460]   But here's the crazy thing.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.780]   David's actually saying something even more than that.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.460]   David's not actually saying
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.640]   that you're gonna experience in your life
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.780]   sometimes a season of green pastures
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.740]   and sometimes a season of dark valleys.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.260]   He's actually saying that those two things
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.380]   can actually coexist at the same time.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.340]   And the reason we know he's saying that
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.560]   is because in our modern translations of Psalm 23,
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.700]   we've added numbered verses,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.320]   verse one, verse two, verse three, verse four,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.280]   to help us dumb sheep understand what's going on here.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.180]   In the original that David wrote,
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.180]   he didn't number his sentences one, two, three, and four.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.660]   He actually wrote a poetic structure.
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.620]   And in fact, when you read the Psalm in Hebrew,
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.300]   verse three and four,
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.820]   verse three speaking about the right paths
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.100]   that God leads us on,
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.500]   and verse four talking about the valley
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.620]   of the shadow of death,
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.860]   those are not two separate thoughts for David.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.620]   It's one continuous flow, two different sentences,
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.420]   but one continuous flow.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.400]   It's like David wants you to understand
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.820]   that the right paths and the valleys that are dark
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.700]   can sometimes be two realities of the same moment in life.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.060]   And that's actually a deeply profound thing.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.580]   That love and suffering can be side by side.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.940]   That hope and despair can have a similar experience
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.700]   in the same moment of our lives.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.900]   And it's like David is inviting us into something
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.100]   that is so beautifully nuanced
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.420]   that we have to realize it's not just about separate seasons,
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.480]   it's about actually what I'm walking through right now,
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.220]   that I can have in my everyday moments of great joy
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.060]   and moments of great despair.
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.360]   And in fact, he's even saying it more deeper than that.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.980]   He's saying this, listen to this.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:24.100]   Sometimes the path that God needs to lead you on
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.620]   is only right if it goes through a darkened valley.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.900]   Oh, you don't want me to preach on that, do you?
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.940]   That's what I'm gonna preach on today.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.380]   That sometimes the actual right path for you
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.820]   that God wants you to be on
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.820]   actually takes you into the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.520]   That actually God understands what you really need
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.600]   for your soul to be restored.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.600]   And sometimes that means that there is the beauty of pain.
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.420]   Oh, the beauty of pain.
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.380]   If you're an anesthetologist in this room,
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.580]   you would understand what I'm talking about.
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.660]   I wanna unpack the idea that there could be beauty in pain,
[00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.460]   that there could be God in the dark valleys.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.340]   And as I do that today,
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.020]   I pray that this will be helpful for some of you
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.580]   who have lived more of a dichotomous life,
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.420]   where you've come to, and I wanna say this,
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.620]   I feel this is prophetic for some of you in this room,
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.440]   you've come to only ever associate God with a good feeling.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.260]   Oh, I'm gonna say that again.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.420]   That's not in my notes, that just came.
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.060]   That's cool, I'm gonna say that again.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.100]   Some of you in this room,
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.800]   you only ever associate God with a good feeling.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.440]   And of course, God has lots of good feelings,
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.940]   but he's also something more.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.060]   I want you to see what he says here.
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.540]   He says, "Even though I walk through the valley
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.040]   "of the shadow of death."
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.260]   The term that he uses, David, for shadow of death here
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.260]   is a Hebrew word, it's tzaltzmach death.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.100]   And what that word literally means is shadow of death,
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.860]   or total and complete darkness.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.580]   David is trying to help you to understand
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.740]   what the valleys of life can feel like.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.260]   And he's not just writing poetically and metaphorically,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.620]   he's actually talking about real valleys.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.860]   Remember, I've been saying in this series
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.460]   that David is writing in the Judean wilderness.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.500]   He's writing in the very place of a desert.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.700]   He's writing in the very place where he had been a shepherd
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.460]   at the early stages of his life.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.300]   Now he's hiding in caves there.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.820]   And in the Judean wilderness,
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.180]   where shepherds would bring their flocks all the time,
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.540]   there were these places of valleys
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.300]   that were known as Tzmalfeth.
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.700]   And these valleys were literally craggy rocks
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.300]   within the Judean hills.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.860]   And they were shaped sort of really narrowly.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.180]   Sometimes to get through them,
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.980]   you could only get through the rocks single file.
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.700]   There were quite high as well, craggy, broken rocks.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.940]   And you would have to go down in through the valley
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.060]   in order to get out the other side
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.580]   where perhaps you would want to go.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.900]   There was no way of getting over it,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.300]   or under it, or around it.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.940]   You would have to always go through it.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.020]   David is picturing this idea as he talks here in the psalm.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.500]   I've actually personally experienced
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.740]   these valleys for myself.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.860]   I actually stayed a night out in the Judean wilderness
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.900]   on my own in 2016,
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.060]   with nothing other than two bottles of water,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.540]   a rucksack on my back, and a sleeping bag.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.980]   And I did it because I wanted to experience
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.980]   what Jesus would have felt being tempted in the wilderness
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.700]   for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.860]   Now, because I'm not Jesus,
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.420]   I did not do it for 40 days and 40 nights.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.980]   I did it for about 14 hours.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.380]   But I was on my own,
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.420]   completely in the middle of the Judean wilderness,
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.900]   which is a very dangerous place.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.980]   Not just Bedouins,
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.740]   the Israeli military operates in that area as well.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.580]   And the Israeli guide that I had,
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.940]   who was helping me do this,
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.900]   he didn't come with me,
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.620]   but he stood on the outside of the Judean wilderness.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.660]   And he said, "Okay, you're gonna walk that way."
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.540]   I'm like, "Okay, cool."
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.260]   He's like, "And here's how you survive."
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.260]   I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on a second.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.860]   What do you mean survive?
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:11.940]   Like, is it that dangerous?"
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.060]   He's like, "Here's how you survive.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.620]   You need to go through for about three and a half hours,
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.180]   and then you'll find yourself coming out
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.700]   onto like a raised plain, like a higher area."
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.540]   And he said, "That's the place that's safe to sleep."
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.940]   And I'm like, "What do you mean by safe?
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.460]   Can we break that down, please?"
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.140]   He's like, "Well, the dogs don't come up there.
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.980]   So that's good."
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.980]   I'm like, "That's good."
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.620]   And he said, "The Bedouins also don't rarely come up
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.460]   in that space.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.780]   If you actually camp down in the lower places
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.940]   of the wilderness,
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.940]   you'll actually get attacked by the Bedouins probably.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.340]   They'll come and mug you and take your valuables.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.660]   So get through that and end up in the plain."
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.620]   So I hiked for about three and a half hours
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.700]   through what David describes
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.140]   as the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.460]   It was scary.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.740]   It's dark in there.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.860]   And it's so dark actually in places
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.220]   where you're walking single file
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.980]   through that kind of valley area
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.940]   that the sun never gets in that place.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.340]   So though it was like 40 degrees
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.780]   and I was hiking in about 40 degrees,
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.220]   when I was inside, it was super cool.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.860]   At night, if you were in there, it would be freezing.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.580]   You'd probably freeze really badly.
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.100]   It's weird to think about freezing in a desert,
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.140]   but that's what happens in these valleys.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.180]   That's what David's picturing.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.940]   And I realized I needed to get through that
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.540]   in order to get to the other side.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.460]   David is explaining in the Psalm
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.340]   that here's what the shepherd sometimes has to do,
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.260]   to take you from the pasture that you're currently in
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.980]   to the one that's actually going to be
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.380]   the thing of blessing for you,
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.740]   the thing of growth for you,
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.140]   the thing of restoration for you.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.900]   The shepherd needs to lead you through the valley
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.220]   that feels like a shadow of death.
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.780]   Notice here the word that's used.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.820]   It says, "Through the valley."
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.780]   David did not say, "We run through it."
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.180]   He doesn't say, "We crawl through it."
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.380]   He says, "I walk," because the shepherd is leading me,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.100]   "through the valley, but I'm getting through it."
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:51.940]   And here's the first thing
[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.460]   some of you in this room need to know.
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.260]   The dark time that you're in right now,
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.860]   the thing that you're really struggling with,
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.540]   the place of suffering and pain,
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.540]   you need to know it's a path
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.500]   that God is moving you through it,
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.460]   that it's not actually gonna be your permanent home.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.420]   Some of you in this room,
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.580]   you think because of how crazy this is
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.620]   and how hard your life is right now,
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.460]   that you think that's the permanent place
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.340]   that you're going to be.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.140]   David is saying there's a valley of the shadow of death.
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.140]   He's not trying to hide the reality
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.220]   that sometimes we face struggles in life.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.420]   But what he's saying is it is not your home.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.300]   It is not where you camp.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.740]   You camp through and up on the other plane.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.660]   You need to get through that valley.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.540]   It is not the place for you to stop.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.700]   It is not the place for you to feel like it's home.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.740]   But some of us, when we're going through hard times
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.900]   and suffering in life, it can be so all-encompassing
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.740]   that we actually begin to think, "Well, this is my life.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.740]   "This is all I can have.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.980]   "This is my plot.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.300]   "I guess I'm just gonna have to live here."
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.620]   And David's saying, "Do not stop walking."
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.940]   There's momentum here.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.620]   Even though I walk, he doesn't say I pause.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.860]   He doesn't say I stop.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.300]   I walk through the valley.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.500]   I've got to go through it.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.700]   I can't avoid it.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.860]   There's blessings in it,
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.300]   which I'm gonna talk about in a minute,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.660]   but I still need to get through it.
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.060]   Some of you have stopped,
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.940]   and the Spirit's word to you today is walk again.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.300]   Equally, for some of you,
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.060]   the dark valleys have come to define
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.620]   how you think about yourself.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.660]   This is really beautiful, what David does here.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.140]   He says the valley is the dark place.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.300]   He doesn't say you are the dark place.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.940]   He doesn't say the sheep are the dark place.
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.340]   He says the valley is.
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.100]   The valley feels that way.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.460]   And so often what happens for us as Christians sometimes
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.660]   when we go through a hard time
[00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.580]   is that we actually, the enemy does this to us.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.300]   He tries to create a strategy
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.300]   where we take that dark and hard time,
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.020]   and we begin to think that that's who we are.
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.900]   We begin to think that, oh, this always happens to me.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.940]   I deserve this because of X, Y, and Z in my life,
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.700]   or this is happening to me.
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.180]   This is part of my identity now.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.700]   I guess I'm just always gonna be an unlucky person.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.940]   I'm always gonna be a person that's upsetting people.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.140]   I'm always, and we suddenly start to think
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.300]   that we are defined as the darkness.
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.780]   And David's like, never think of yourself as the darkness.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.900]   You are children of God, saved by Him,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.580]   redeemed by Him, released into the light.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.220]   Doesn't mean you don't experience some darkness,
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.100]   but the darkness is not you.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.940]   Some of us need to release the fact
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.380]   that we've identified ourselves in the darkness and go,
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.620]   no, no, no, hang on a sec.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.660]   This situation I'm in, it sucks.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.540]   It sucks.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.340]   But I am not the sum total of that situation.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.660]   He then says this.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.580]   He says, "Even though I walk through the valley
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.820]   of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.860]   It's like, David, really?
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.020]   I will fear no evil.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.020]   The word evil here literally means disaster or calamity.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.740]   David's saying, when I'm in the darkest of places,
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.020]   I will fear no calamity.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:08.060]   I will fear no ultimate disaster in my life.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:12.820]   Notice that David does not say, I won't have any disasters.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.140]   He doesn't say, I walk through the valley
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.700]   of the shadow of death and nothing impacts me.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.020]   He doesn't say, I avoid the disaster
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.460]   or I circumvent the disaster.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.020]   He just says, I will not fear the disaster.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.060]   In other words, he's talking about an internal perception
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.820]   about the reality of his circumstances.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.500]   He's not, again, trying to give us a prosperity gospel.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.220]   He's not saying, hey, if you just believe in Jesus,
[00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.420]   you'll be sort of sucked out of all the bad stuff
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.620]   that's ever gonna happen in your life.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.900]   He's saying, no, we sometimes walk through valleys
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.540]   that feel like the shadow of death, but guess what?
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.980]   I won't fear the reality of the situation I'm in.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.060]   The situation may happen, that calamity may take place.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.540]   For some of you in this room, that marriage might break down.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.460]   That job may not work out.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.820]   That relationship that you've invested your time in
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.900]   might not come into fruition.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.780]   That thing, that investment that you made,
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.860]   you might lose your money and all of that might happen.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.220]   And that will be a calamity.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.500]   It'll be a disaster.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.360]   It will suck, it'll hurt.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.900]   There'll be suffering involved.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.900]   But what David is saying is when we know the shepherd,
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.020]   we do not have to fear the reality, the impact,
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.660]   and the shaping of all of that stuff.
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.320]   It may still happen,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.500]   but we don't have to allow it to define us.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.220]   The word fear here literally means
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.440]   to not be overcome by or shaped by, transformed by.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.540]   It's like David is putting a stake in the ground
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.200]   and saying evil, calamity, disaster will happen
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.020]   in your life, but it doesn't have to define you.
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.700]   There is other things that will seek to transform you.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.820]   You don't need to allow those things
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.580]   to tell you who you are.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.700]   There is more to you
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.620]   than the disaster you might be in right now.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.900]   What is the thing that's more?
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.540]   He says this simply, "For you are with me."
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.740]   This is quite profound, although we read it and we think,
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.040]   oh yeah, but it's actually really profound.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.380]   David's saying the reason why I can be
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.620]   a non-anxious presence, fear no evil,
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.060]   a non-anxious presence amid the chaos of this world
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:25.060]   is 'cause I know God is with me in the darkest of places,
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.180]   in the places of greatest pain,
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.380]   in the places that have overwhelmed me.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.700]   He's saying God's presence is in the darkened valleys
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.940]   as much as it is in the green pastures.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.380]   And church, this is something we really need to wrestle with
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.460]   because as Christians, it's very easy for us
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.700]   to just think that God is only with us
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.420]   when things are going well.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.020]   We have a tendency to think God's presence is found
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.900]   when we're lifting our hands in worship in church.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.340]   We think God's presence is there
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.020]   when we get the bonus at the end of the year.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.620]   We think God's presence is there
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.340]   when we find our spouse for life.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.400]   And yes, he is there in all of those moments.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.060]   But we have this idea that we've come to define
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.500]   God's presence as only a good feeling,
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.020]   so therefore God's presence is only ever with us
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.500]   when things are green pastures.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.180]   But when things are hard, when suffering comes,
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.940]   when my life has been turned upside down,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.020]   we tend to think God has left us.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.940]   We need to confess that faulty thinking of God.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.540]   We think in our suffering, God is not there.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.580]   And David is saying, "In the darkest of valleys,
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.900]   he is with me.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.660]   He never gives up on me, never leaves me,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.980]   never forsakes me.
[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.900]   He's always there for me all the time."
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.700]   And the reason why that's such a joy for David
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.100]   is 'cause he realizes, "If I understand
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.460]   that God is present with me in the good moments
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.660]   and the bad moments, here's the thing.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.660]   I've come to realize what is the only true constant in life."
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.060]   Listen to this, church.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.820]   Everything in the Psalm so far, in Psalm 23, verses one to four,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.900]   all of the circumstances and situations
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.020]   David has been speaking about, green pastures,
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.100]   quiet waters, paths of righteousness,
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.140]   even valleys of the shadows of death,
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.620]   all of them are temporary.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.260]   David is saying all these things are temporary.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.100]   They're not your home.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.140]   They're not the true constant in life.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.660]   You wanna know the one thing that is constant,
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.420]   that is bankable, that you can put your whole life upon?
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.020]   You can't guarantee green pastures all your life.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.180]   Likewise, you can't always be in dark valleys.
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.860]   What you can know is that God will be with you
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.540]   no matter what is going on.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.660]   That's the permanency of this.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.220]   This is the permanency of blessing,
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.940]   that God is always with us.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.780]   Stop thinking that blessing means good things for you
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.620]   and start realizing that blessing
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.940]   means the presence of God in your life.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.900]   And the presence of God in your life
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.900]   is needed in the hard times, perhaps even more
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.220]   than it's needed in the good times.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.140]   He's the one constant thing that you can take to the bank
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.740]   and believe because of that,
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.900]   I can be a non-anxious presence in this world
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.900]   'cause I know my life is not dependent
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.980]   on the temporary nature of circumstances.
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.060]   My life is dependent on the permanent nature
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.620]   of God's character.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.460]   He is with me.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.860]   He's with me.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.500]   My darkest valley,
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:29.900]   my darkest valley was 22nd of March, 2019.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.860]   By that day, my dad had been in the hospital for three days
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.380]   and he'd had cancer for a couple of years,
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.140]   but the cancer had finally shown up in his liver.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.060]   And so for three days, he was in the hospital
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.700]   and the doctors were doing some great work
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.820]   to help him to try some experimental treatments
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.420]   to see if there's any way of saving their lives.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.140]   And the doctors were saying to us,
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.540]   maybe a week, maybe two.
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.700]   And we were in the midst of trying to process that.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.500]   And on the evening of the 22nd of March,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.660]   one of the doctors said to us,
[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:04.180]   "Hey, it'd be really good if one of you could stay
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.940]   "with your dad through the night."
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.020]   And because he was in a male-only ward,
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.420]   that responsibility fell to me.
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.300]   And so my family all left at about 10 o'clock at night.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.540]   And my dad was conscious.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.900]   He was awake.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.940]   He was able to move about a little bit.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.260]   He was obviously bedridden in many ways.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.300]   His liver was causing him to feel like he needed
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.740]   to go to the toilet every two minutes,
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:30.220]   even though he had no water in his system to urinate out.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:36.180]   And I didn't really know what to expect that evening.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.140]   But I sat at his bedside,
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.420]   and I did everything I could in my power
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.860]   to make him feel comfortable for about six hours
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.820]   when my dad was in continuous pain.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.460]   And I couldn't give him drugs, of course.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.300]   And it wasn't right.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   He'd had some drugs earlier,
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.500]   so he couldn't take drugs again for a while.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   And I don't wanna tell you all the things
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.820]   that we did over those six hours,
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.620]   'cause that's between me and my dad.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:12.020]   But it was really painful to see my dad
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.460]   in that much pain and suffering.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.300]   And none of my other family members saw it
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.660]   because they weren't there.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:24.260]   And I had to try to help him as best I could.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.900]   And after about, by about 3.30 in the morning,
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:31.500]   I realized I am absolutely at the end of my ability
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.780]   to help my dad, to relieve his suffering,
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.780]   to do whatever he needed.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.260]   I think it was about 3.30 in the morning,
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:45.220]   and I was literally like, I have nothing in me,
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   physically, emotionally, spiritually.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.460]   There's nothing left.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.260]   I felt a failure.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.060]   I felt a deep sense of pain
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.660]   that I couldn't be the son I wanted to be
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.900]   to my dad in that moment.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.620]   I felt like I was just useless.
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.300]   And the Holy Spirit woke Sidney up.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.380]   Sidney's sitting here.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:07.340]   He's a doctor at the Adventist Hospital.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.020]   And woke Sidney up at 3.30 in the morning
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.820]   and brought him to my dad's bedside.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.420]   And Sidney walked into the room,
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.780]   and I think immediately he could see
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.820]   that I was completely done.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.660]   But I think he could also see that my father was not long.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.820]   And so he said to me, you need to call your family,
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.100]   get them here as soon as possible.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.940]   So I did.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.740]   I called my mom, my sisters, my extended family,
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.820]   my dad's extended family, and they all came in,
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.940]   and about 30 minutes later, my dad passed.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.340]   And for about three months after that moment,
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.300]   I was very angry at God.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.660]   Because I couldn't understand why I had to be the one
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.660]   to see my dad like that for six hours.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.500]   That the last memories of my father were those memories.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.520]   And you know that if you go through a traumatic time
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.700]   or something that's really difficult,
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.520]   those become fresh and lingering memories for you.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.460]   And I was angry at God that he would leave me
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.660]   with those memories.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.580]   I was angry at God because he had called me
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.580]   to do something I was not capable to do.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.060]   Because I couldn't stand with my dad
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.260]   in the way that I wanted to really stand with him.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.140]   And during those three months that I was angry at God,
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.660]   he came into my life and began to work through
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.960]   what was happening in that moment with my dad.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.020]   And he said to me, "You can't imagine what it meant
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.420]   "to your father for you to be present with him
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.420]   "in the final six hours of his life."
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.660]   He said, "Andrew, you can't even begin to grasp
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.980]   "what that meant to him."
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.840]   And he said, "And I know how hard it was for you.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:52.860]   "But I want you to know that in and through
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.740]   "that experience, I wanted you, Andrew,
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.280]   "to understand what it's like for me to be at your bedside
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.740]   "every moment of your life.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.140]   "I will never give up on you.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.380]   "I will never forsake you.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.540]   "Even if you do the worst things,
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.180]   "I will be there right for you.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.660]   "'Cause that's who I am.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660]   "I'm your God."
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:21.020]   And even now, as I tell you this story,
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.340]   I feel a sense of like,
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:25.220]   why did I have to go through that dark valley
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.460]   to learn that lesson?
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.980]   But at the same breath, because green pastures
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.200]   and dark valleys can exist together in the same moment,
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.460]   I can stand before you now and say,
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.800]   "I am more at peace in my life as your leader here.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:45.620]   "I am more deeply understanding of the power
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.700]   "of the presence of God in my life for you as your pastor
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.740]   "because I went through that experience."
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.740]   And David's trying to explain here in the Psalm
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.500]   that there are moments of green pastures in our lives
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.700]   that are designed specifically
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.740]   because there is only a part of God's character
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.240]   that can be learned during a green pasture moment.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.400]   But he's also saying that the reason why he leads us
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.520]   through valleys of the shadow of death
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.080]   is because there are things of God's character
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.240]   that you can only ever grasp or know
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.200]   if you experience him in the midst of that place.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.820]   Some of you here right now,
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.320]   you're seeing your dark valley as how I felt on that day.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.920]   And look, we know as we go through these things,
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.600]   it's really difficult.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.560]   David understood that.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.680]   He's not saying just 'cause God's there,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.040]   you don't suffer any pain.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.920]   In fact, sometimes God's presence is the thing
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.040]   that brings us the pain
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.480]   because God's presence causes us to repent,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   causes us to do things that we need to do
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.680]   to get right with him and right with others.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.080]   But he's saying, "I'm with you.
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.020]   "And if you really know that I am with you,
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:05.360]   "no matter what happens in your life,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.480]   "you will be set free from fear."
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.080]   I stand before you today way more set free from fear
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.900]   than when I was before that moment with my father.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.080]   And then what does he say?
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.540]   Well, how does David finish this idea?
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.300]   How do we receive the presence of God?
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.720]   How do we know that comfort?
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.160]   How does that comfort fill us with hope?
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.000]   He says at the end, "Your rod and your staff,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.240]   "they comfort me."
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.360]   He's talking about the shepherd, right?
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.320]   He's continuing the imagery of the shepherd.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.480]   He says, "The rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.680]   This is a rod and a staff, a shepherd's rod and a staff.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.660]   Let me explain these to you real quick.
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.920]   This is a rod.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.200]   This is actually a little bit bigger
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.600]   than what a shepherd's rod would have been.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.020]   A shepherd's rod is about a meter long,
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.920]   so it would be about maybe that long.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.560]   And it was designed to fit custom-made
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.080]   into the shepherd's hand.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.360]   And the shepherd would use the rod
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.000]   for two primary things for the sheep.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.400]   The first was the first line of defense
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.020]   on behalf of the sheep.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.020]   The shepherd was very skilled at using this rod
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.660]   to defend back or to knock back any enemy
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.100]   or threat to the sheep.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.260]   The shepherd could throw this thing
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.900]   and it would sort of spin in the air
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.980]   and the hard end of it would hit against, say,
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.260]   a bear or a cougar or a lion, something like that,
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.940]   and knock it back from the sheep.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.500]   Sometimes the shepherd would get right in front of the sheep,
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.500]   sorry, and smack them like this,
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.860]   smack, not the sheep, not the sheep,
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.380]   but the, you're a lion right now,
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.400]   smack the lion away from the sheep, right?
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.700]   So sometimes that's what the shepherd would do,
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.740]   like hit or throw.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.500]   If you get up and go to the toilet in the next 10 minutes,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.380]   I'm throwing this thing at you.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.080]   Don't think I can't get you in the upper house.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.620]   I've done it before, I'll do it again.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.460]   No, just kidding.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.280]   But that's what he would do.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.300]   He would defend the sheep with the rod.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.480]   And you need to know here, if you're in a dark valley,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.980]   God defends you.
[00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.340]   And he defends you not with a physical rod
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.240]   like the shepherd today,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.060]   but he defends you with three things.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:00.900]   You've been making notes?
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.020]   These three things are very helpful to make a note of.
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:07.560]   The first thing he defends you with is the word of God.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:11.080]   His word defines for you who you are.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.420]   His word tells you the person that you are
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.440]   when the valley is trying to define you as the darkness.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.620]   It's his word that we stand upon.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.180]   It's his word that is the rock that is under our feet.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.360]   It is what scripture says about God
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.880]   that drives us to understand who we are in him,
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.280]   no matter the circumstances, situation that we are in.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.840]   His word is always primary.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.400]   And God is never, ever going to back away from his word.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.840]   He's never gonna contradict it.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.360]   He's never gonna present anything other
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.560]   than who he has already presented to us in the scriptures.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.380]   That's number one.
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.600]   The second thing is the blood of Jesus.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.580]   The blood of Jesus is the rod of God
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.700]   to defend the enemy's attack from your life.
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.640]   The blood of Jesus,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.840]   the death and resurrection of Jesus on the cross
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.620]   has purchased for you salvation and redemption.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.960]   It has set you free.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.360]   It means that death no longer is the end of your story.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.600]   It means that you have a new path now.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.360]   It means that the shadow of death is not a dead end.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.080]   Before you came to Christ Jesus,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.880]   the shadow of death is a dead end.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.960]   After Christ Jesus, it's a path and a valley
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.600]   that has an entrance and an exit point.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.100]   Christ is returning so that you would know the fullness
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.560]   of what it was that you were created for.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.800]   He's returning so you'll never know pain,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.300]   suffering, or death anymore.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.280]   But in the moment right now,
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.500]   where both green pastures and dark valleys
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.300]   can exist in the same moment, His blood covers you.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.120]   It protects you and fights for you.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.920]   The final thing is the church.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.360]   God's community is a defense for you.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.280]   It's the thing that stands beside you and says,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.720]   "We hear you, we see you,
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.040]   we know the hard time you're in.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.000]   We're praying for you right now."
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.920]   God's church is the brothers and sisters,
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.220]   the children of God coming around us and saying,
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.760]   "I've got you.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.880]   You matter to me.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.620]   And my prayers, the prayers of a righteous person
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:58.120]   is powerful and effective.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.760]   And if you're going through a hard time right now,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.360]   I will put that stake in the ground and I will defend you.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.160]   I'll grab my rod on your behalf,
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.240]   which is the power of prayer, and I will stand for you."
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.640]   In fact, 'cause I feel the Holy Spirit right now,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.700]   we're gonna do this right now.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.060]   I haven't finished my sermon, just to let you know,
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.200]   but we're gonna do this right now.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.200]   If you are in need of the church to pray for you
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.680]   for whatever it is right now that's going on in your life,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.180]   I want you to stand right now.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.760]   Come on, let's do some business with God right now,
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.600]   right in the middle of this.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.320]   If you would like the church to pray for you,
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.060]   if you'd like someone to stand with you,
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.640]   if there's something going on in your life right now,
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640]   why don't you stand?
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.940]   And if you're still sitting, which is awesome,
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.940]   I want you to lay hands on the people that are now standing.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:48.520]   We're not gonna worry about COVID in the name of Jesus.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.540]   You can put your hands on people, physical human people.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.220]   Father, we wanna stand as a church community
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.640]   over the people that are standing right now.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:01.180]   Holy Spirit, we pray in the name of Jesus
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.200]   that you would come and fight back the enemy strategies
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.000]   over the people that are standing right now.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.580]   Lord, if there are concerns, you would come, Holy Spirit.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.860]   If there are fears, you would take them captive
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.600]   in your name, Lord Jesus.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.200]   Lord, if there are things that are happening
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.460]   that are just not controllable for them,
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.840]   we pray that you would step in and take control.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.460]   Lord, as the church of Christ, as children of God,
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.960]   we stand on their behalf.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:29.080]   And we pray scripture that it says that the prayers
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.560]   of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.380]   We're not righteous in our own strength,
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.100]   but because of the blood of Jesus.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.800]   So everybody in the lower house, in the upper house,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.360]   online right now, we stand with you,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.200]   and we say, get back, enemy, in the name of Jesus.
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.760]   You do not have any authority.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.640]   You take authority over these people.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.360]   We release them into the care and the hope
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.880]   and the life of Jesus.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.660]   And we pray this in Jesus' name, everyone says.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.880]   All right, you can sit back down,
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.680]   but do not leave, 'cause I'm not done.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.160]   Here's the other thing.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.640]   I said there were two things the rod did.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.580]   Here's the other thing the rod did.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:10.220]   The rod was also used by the shepherd
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.620]   to discipline the sheep.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.660]   And this is the bit that we don't like to think about,
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.880]   but I'm gonna preach on this one for a minute.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.680]   In fact, David said, this is a comfort to me.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   It's a comfort to me that the shepherd disciplines me,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.840]   that the shepherd corrects me,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.300]   because I need correction,
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.280]   'cause I'm the sheep and not the shepherd.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.600]   And he said, one of the things that helps me
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.540]   get through a valley of the shadow of death,
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.920]   when I realize that the valley
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.560]   was sometimes caused by my sin,
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   when I realize that sometimes my poor choices,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.920]   my words, my language, my actions
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.800]   actually created the suffering that I'm in right now,
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.840]   I'm grateful that I have a God who's big enough
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.020]   to come alongside of me in grace and forgive me, yes,
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.840]   but also say, go and sin no more.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.320]   Also say, hey, there's a way that you are living
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.200]   that's not the way I want you to live.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.840]   A shepherd with the rod,
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.740]   let's say a sheep was on its way
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.720]   to eat some poisonous weeds.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.940]   There were a lot of poisonous weeds
[00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.000]   in the Judean wilderness.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.160]   And the sheep didn't know a poisonous weed
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.920]   from a non-poisonous one, but a good shepherd did.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.520]   And so if the sheep was heading towards the poisonous weed,
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.720]   here's what the shepherd would do.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.440]   He would take the rod and he would smack it on the ground.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.900]   He would never hit the sheep,
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.480]   but he would hit the ground in front of the sheep.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.560]   And immediately the sheep will then be so scared
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.040]   that it would turn around and run in the other direction.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.600]   I've had many times in my life
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   where God has taken the rod and smacked the ground before me.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:38.300]   We said last week that we should have an expectation
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.700]   that God leads us.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.720]   Part of God's leadership in your life
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.440]   is his discipline of your life.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.280]   It's his correction over you.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.720]   And I wasn't gonna talk about that last week
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.800]   'cause I wanted to talk about it this week.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.220]   But here's the thing you need to realize,
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.360]   that we can't have the expectation
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.060]   of God's direction in our lives
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.800]   without actually opening ourselves
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.020]   to the acceptance of his correction.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:05.320]   In fact, expectation of God's leadership
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:10.320]   without the appropriate acceptance of his discipline
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.340]   is delusional.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:16.120]   God desires to discipline you because he loves you,
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.640]   because he's making an investment in you,
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.000]   'cause he's saying you're my sheep
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.440]   and my sheep need to walk strong in this life.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.220]   My sheep need to know my voice.
[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.680]   My sheep need to be the non-anxious presence
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.560]   in a chaotic world.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.120]   My church needs to rise up in strength.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.880]   And when the church is in sin,
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.440]   he will come and discipline those that he loves.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.920]   So you need to realize
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:42.360]   that you're actually interpreting the discipline of God
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.040]   for an attack of the enemy in your life,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.800]   because you associate God too much with a good feeling.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.280]   And sometimes we turn conviction into condemnation.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.360]   In fact, in the New Testament,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.320]   I've just got a few more minutes.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.760]   Is that okay if I can keep going with you guys for a bit?
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:06.320]   Okay then.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.840]   I wanna read you something from Hebrews.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.080]   And in the New Testament,
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.440]   they talked about this all the time.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.920]   It's not just the Psalm 23 thing.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.640]   Here's how the author of Hebrews put it.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.640]   Endure hardship as discipline.
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.500]   God is treating you as a child.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.360]   For what children are not disciplined by their fathers?
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.800]   If you are not disciplined and everyone undergoes discipline,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.360]   then you are illegitimate children
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.080]   and not true sons and daughters.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.880]   Moreover, we have all had human fathers
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.920]   who have disciplined us and respected them for it.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.200]   How much more should we now submit ourselves
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.000]   to the father of our spirits and live?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.800]   Our fathers disciplined us for a little while
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.880]   as they thought best,
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.560]   but God disciplines us for our good
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.520]   that we may share in his holiness.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.200]   No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.640]   There's Hebrews saying,
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.000]   God sometimes feels like a bit of pain.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.480]   It's painful at the time.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.000]   But later on, however,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.840]   it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.640]   for those that have been trained by it.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.160]   Oh, David says, your discipline comforts me
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.720]   'cause it keeps me away from the poison weeds
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.760]   and it releases me onto the right paths,
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   even when those right paths take me
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.320]   through a valley of the shadow of death.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.920]   And then he says, finally, and I'm finishing with this.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.680]   He says, your staff comforts me.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:31.640]   A shepherd's staff is perhaps the most iconic picture
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.800]   of a shepherd that there is.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.160]   In fact, there's no other profession
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.480]   that uses a staff that's shaped like this,
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:41.280]   the iconic hook shape of the shepherd's staff.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.720]   David says, this thing comforts us
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.880]   in the darkest of valleys.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.800]   And the question is, how does this staff comfort us?
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.720]   Shepherds use the staff for one primary purpose.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.280]   And it's perhaps one that you wouldn't necessarily think of.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.560]   In birthing season, when the sheep are giving birth,
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.520]   when the mother sheep are giving birth to the lambs,
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.480]   when the lamb is birthed,
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:11.360]   the shepherd scoops up the lamb at the end of the hook.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.520]   Here, scoops up the little lamb,
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.000]   carries the lamb and places it at the head of the mother.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.960]   Now, why does the shepherd scoop up the lamb
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.120]   rather than grab the lamb with his own hands?
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.280]   Well, it's because if the shepherd grabbed the lamb
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.920]   with his own hands, his scent would be on the newborn lamb.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.600]   And so when the lamb comes and be placed before the mother,
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.960]   because it's smelt human and not like the lamb,
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.680]   there's a chance the mother might reject it.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.200]   So instead, it's like a pizza oven.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.880]   Ooh, there's the pizza,
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.200]   and bring it over to your table right here, right?
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.880]   Like, there's the lamb and there's the mother.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.400]   And so in other words, God's staff comforts us
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.680]   because he enables us to be connected to one another.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.800]   He wants unity in the body of Christ.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.160]   He wants us to do what we just did a moment ago,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.560]   praying for one another, loving each other,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.440]   cheering each other on, disciplining each other,
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.240]   being open to the discipline of one another,
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.240]   listening to critique and feedback.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.560]   He wants us to be unified together.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.800]   And so God does that for us, and it's a comfort,
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.240]   particularly in the valley that is shadowy
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.800]   and feels like death.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   The other thing that the staff does,
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.440]   and this is the one that you'd probably know it for mostly,
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.960]   is when a sheep got a little bit out of the way,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:37.400]   he would take it like this and pull the sheep forward,
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.480]   like that.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.760]   Good job, buddy, good job.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:45.540]   Now, not yank, not hurt, but a gentle connection
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.040]   to pull the sheep back to him.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.280]   So the staff not only brought the sheep
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.400]   and connected them to the sheep,
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.720]   but it also brought the sheep towards the shepherd.
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.480]   And so when David says the staff is a comfort to us,
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.720]   he's talking about the fact that we can react
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.240]   and relate to one another,
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.020]   and the fact that we can relate and react
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.360]   and be intimate with God.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.680]   Where the rod was a symbol of power and authority
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.200]   and strength, the staff is a symbol of intimacy and love.
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.800]   So let me summarize all this with this.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:23.680]   God and his presence is what transforms you.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.560]   The single most important thing David wants you to know
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.440]   when you're in the valley of the shadow of death
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.560]   is that it is his presence that transforms us,
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.080]   transforms you.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.440]   And I want you to take this,
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.640]   'cause this is really important.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:39.820]   He does not say that he will transform your circumstances.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.280]   In fact, God is not interested per se
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.080]   in transforming your circumstances.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.480]   What he's interested in is transforming you.
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:52.180]   Because if he can make you fear no evil,
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:54.640]   no matter what you go through in life,
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.240]   he will make you a fiery, passionate, non-anxious presence
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.840]   in the chaos of this world.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.960]   And there is nothing greater than that.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.120]   His desire is to change you
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.920]   more than his desire is to change your circumstances.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.600]   And let me finish by saying this.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.260]   Some of you need to stop asking God
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:16.160]   to change your circumstances
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.240]   when God is using your circumstances to change you.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.080]   For those six hours with my dad,
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.680]   I prayed a lot for God to relieve my dad and relieve me,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.880]   and it didn't happen.
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.120]   I prayed for God to change my circumstances,
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.200]   and it didn't happen.
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.680]   And I was bitter about that for months,
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.000]   until God showed up and said,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.920]   "I changed your dad 'cause he's now in glory.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.980]   And I changed you,
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.240]   'cause you're now that much stronger in me."
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.400]   May you know a God who loves and transforms you,
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.460]   and may you not allow the darkness to overcome you.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.440]   I wonder if you'd stand with me, I'd love to pray for you.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:08.880]   Father, we're just grateful that we have a God
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.760]   who doesn't hold back on us,
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.000]   who doesn't try to paint a rosy picture
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   and ignore the big elephant in the room.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.680]   A God who is willing to say,
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.040]   "Green pastures and dark valleys exist together,
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.160]   at least in this time before the return of Christ."
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.240]   Father, I thank you that there are things
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.520]   that we can only know about you in the green pastures,
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.160]   and things we can only know about you
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.520]   in the darkest of valleys.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.440]   Lord, people in this room,
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.420]   some of them are going through
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.720]   the darkest of valley right now.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.440]   Lord, I wanna pray that they would know you are here.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.480]   I wanna pray right now.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.560]   If that's for you, just open your hands as I'm praying.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.640]   I wanna release this over you today,
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.400]   so that you leave here filled with hope and expectation.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.560]   I'm not promising you today a change in your circumstances.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.320]   I'm not promising you that you're suddenly
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.880]   gonna get out of the valley that you feel you're in.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.920]   God, what I will promise you
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.120]   is that God is leading you through the valley.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.880]   What I will promise you is that you're not alone.
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.080]   What I will promise you is that you have the word of God,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.840]   the blood of Christ, and the church standing on your behalf.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.480]   What I will promise you is that you have the spirit of God
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.280]   working on behalf of you to draw you in intimacy
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.960]   with the people around you, with your community group,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.480]   with your family, and here with him as well.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.360]   I will promise you transformation for yourself,
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.720]   if not transformation for your circumstances.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.060]   Lord, I pray that you would root us as non-anxious presence
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.000]   in the chaos of our city.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.520]   Lord, I pray that we would know you
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.560]   as a shepherd in this way.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.520]   (gentle music)
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.680]   And I pray too, Lord.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:54.040]   I pray too, Lord, that you would,
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:59.360]   you would be a God that we honor.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.620]   I just confess, Lord, that I have not honored you always
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.000]   in the seasons of my life.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.440]   I confess, Lord, that I have not always honored you
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.280]   in the dark valleys.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.160]   And I pray now, Lord, for all of us here,
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.120]   for the Vine Church, for those online
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.280]   and those in this room.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:21.760]   Lord, we're sorry if we haven't honored you at times
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.700]   in the dark valleys.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.240]   Lord, would you forgive us?
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.560]   I know you do forgive us.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.040]   Lord, would you scoop us up on that staff of yours,
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.400]   the Holy Spirit, and would you bring us close to you again?
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.920]   And Lord, we thank you for this.
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.280]   We'll encourage you not to rush.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   We're gonna continue to worship now,
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.160]   and we'll close the service in just a minute.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.360]   But I wanna allow this space
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.560]   for the Spirit to minister to you.
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.040]   So maybe just keep your hands open where you are.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.720]   Maybe just allow the Holy Spirit to continue to come.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.040]   We've got a prayer team as well,
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.240]   and the prayer team are gonna be available
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.320]   for you to receive personal prayer, if you would like that.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.840]   But as the worship team come and just sing over us again,
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.800]   take this time.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.320]   The Holy Spirit is here so beautifully with you.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.240]   Don't rush the time to just connect with Him.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.340]   We thank you for this.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:26.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
