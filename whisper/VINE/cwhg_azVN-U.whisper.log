[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Wow, how do we follow that up? We'll try, I'll try. I just want to say good morning to everyone
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   watching online. I want to just send some love to my parents watching from Toronto, Canada.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120]   And Overflow, I can't see you, but I can see through the walls. I know you're there. And so
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.800]   Upper House, I welcome everyone. You know, if you're just joining us, we are in this incredible
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.520]   series. And I think there's never, we should always be talking about the Holy Spirit. So we've
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.520]   been talking and thinking and wrestling with our understanding with the Holy Spirit. And let me
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.480]   summarize, if you have not been here, what we've been covering, what we've learned together. We
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.080]   learned that the Holy Spirit is a person and not a force that we can conjure any time because we
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.840]   want something. But the Holy Spirit as a person dwells in us as believers to illuminate and reveal
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.960]   to us who God is. That's what we talked about last time. But also the Holy Spirit reorders and
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.720]   restores all the chaos that is within us and happening around us. The Holy Spirit comforts
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.600]   and restores and heals us as our elder Susanna spoke about. And for us, if we are serious and
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.160]   we want to experience and encounter the work of the Spirit, then we have to have a willingness,
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.040]   a surrenderedness to say, "Lord, give it to me. I am here to hear whatever you have." And so today,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.520]   I want to focus on the work of the Spirit in our personal life, but also in our congregational life.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.480]   So in my preparation, I kind of look back on my own faith journey. I'm going through a midlife
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.280]   confusion. Some call it midlife crisis, whatever, right? Whatever it is, it doesn't matter. But I'm
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.080]   grateful for this life that I have with you, but also just what God has given me. And so when I
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.280]   look back, I look back when I was a new Christian. I came to Christ when I was 16. And looking back,
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.360]   I know the Holy Spirit was with me every single step of the way, illuminating, teaching me,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.280]   showing me how to be a better person in His eyes from His perspective, but also teaching me
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.360]   what it meant to live in the Word. And when I look back, as much as God was there, the Spirit of God
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.800]   was there, who was also there were my boys. And so I want to show you this photo for... This was
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.760]   the day I got baptized. And I know, you know, and looking back, I cannot separate my growth and my
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.560]   love for God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit from the friendship that I've had with these boys.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.600]   And to this day, we still meet up. And as 16-year-olds, we spent time just goofing around,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.760]   laughing, playing sports. But what was really memorable for me was every week, we would spend
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.800]   three, four hours in God's Word. And so I am grateful to God for bringing these guys into my
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.720]   life. And so from there, I grew up a bit into my 20s. And as a young adult, I spent all my 20s and
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.040]   my 30s here, and hopefully I spend my 40s here. But it was different in that time. The Holy Spirit
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.800]   was still present, but He showed up in our times together. So if you, some of us in this room,
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   you know exactly what I'm talking about. I want to show you a photo. And every week, God's presence
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.920]   would show up. He would intimately, but yet publicly manifest Himself, bringing us to our
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.840]   knees. And it was a scary time because the love of God was so tangible, was so evident. And actually,
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.160]   I was scared to come to church on Sundays because I just was still recovering from what God had
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.760]   shown me the week before. But there was such a reverence in the air, but not just in the air,
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.680]   in our lives. There was an overflow where after meeting, after worshiping, and these photos,
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.560]   they're not great photos, but they're not, this is pre-iPhone. We had digital cameras, and therefore
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.960]   it was shaky. But these photos represent for me a desperation, a hunger, a thirst that said, "Lord,
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.720]   if you don't show up, I can't even imagine a life where you don't show up and meet us today."
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.600]   And so I would say that God's presence changed us. And a lot of us here in this room are here
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.080]   because God done something in us in that time, and that still carries forward within us.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.400]   Fast forward to recent years, fast forward actually to a few months ago. This was a photo
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.560]   that I took from the stage here of our prayer meeting together, and it was a beautiful time.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.400]   And it is right now, we are in the midst of this time where I realized that if we want a maturing
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.200]   faith, then we have to find a balance between our own personal walk with God, our prayer time,
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.280]   our reflection time, our wrestling with what God is doing in our life. But equally, the older I get,
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.840]   the more we meet, I realize how much I need you guys so that we can worship and wrestle and pray
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.560]   and seek God together and to witness what the Spirit is doing amongst us, even just right now.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.480]   And even if you are online watching, you felt that. I know God is speaking to each of us in
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.320]   such different ways, and that is what I live for. That is, I pray, what you would also desire every
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.560]   time you come before God, but also when we meet. And so I comprehend now that the spiritual reality
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.680]   that we live as Christians, it's this simple maybe, that the Spirit of God, He works in both
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.520]   a personal setting, but also our communal setting. And sometimes we forget that, and they are not
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.000]   mutually exclusive. So our discipleship with Christ is enriched, it's mature in so as much as
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.400]   we can accept and invest into both realities, that we take our faith seriously, but we also take the
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.680]   times that we have with God faithfully, meaning that it is possible that we experience God every
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.760]   single day of the week and not just here. So that's quite ideal, but that's also our lived reality.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:12.480]   But usually, what gets in the way, church? What gets in the way? Someone at the last service said
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.640]   life, and that is so true, but what actually gets in the way is us most of the time. As Christians,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:25.520]   we have this very human tendency to emphasize one at the expense of the other. Now, let me know if
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.360]   this rings true for you. What happens is that sometimes, because we have such a passion for
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.240]   what God does in our life personally, that it is easy sometimes to come here to service, not being
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.160]   too bothered about what God's going to do. And so kind of we check out or we think about what's
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.800]   coming up next. But equally, there are times where we focus so much on what is happening here.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.120]   We live for this day. It's like, "Oh my gosh, Sunday, I'm going to come. The Holy Spirit's
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.680]   going to wreck us and work in us." But then the danger sometimes is we forget that God is still
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.520]   moving. What we just sang, even if we forget it, even if we don't feel it, God's love is as steady
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.440]   as the rising sun. And so I wonder, why do we expect the Spirit to come in one of these
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.720]   situations and not always both? Why do some of us only experience God here, or why do some of us
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.360]   only really feel like we meet God at home in the solitude of our closet, our room? And that's why
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.480]   I want us to think about today. I get the sense that even though there's a discrepancy, even though,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.360]   yeah, nothing's perfect, but what I want to bring up before us today is, could it be that our
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.680]   expectations, our understanding, our preferences for the Holy Spirit can limit and get in the way
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:53.920]   of what He wants to do in our life, but also when we gather together? And so I want to ask you,
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.480]   when you open up God's Word, whether it's here or whether it's at home, do you carry the same
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.320]   expectation and anticipation as you do right now on a Sunday, that God will show up and He will
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:14.480]   satisfy you? Likewise, I want to ask you, when you gather in like this right now on a Sunday together,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.840]   do you believe that God will personally speak directly to you as He does in your one-on-one
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:26.320]   times with Him? So the central question that I think a lot of us ask is, why can't I sense God
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:32.720]   in both places? And so I want you to ask, as we trek, as I preach today, as I share God's Word,
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.400]   I want us to think about, is it possible for us to experience God both in our private life
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:45.200]   and also our communal life? We're going to explore this tension and question through
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:53.360]   1 Peter chapter 4, and what I would like to offer is I want to highlight three habits that we have
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:00.800]   as Christians, as a church, that limit and stifle and hinders, that prevents the Holy Spirit from
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.880]   working in our life, whether it's personal or communal. And so everything I have to do,
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.760]   everything I have to say, has to do with how you and I relate to the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:19.200]   You trekking with me, you guys okay? So I'm going to read 1 Peter chapter 4, verse 7 to 11. I'm
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.920]   reading from the NRSV. "The end of all things is near. Therefore, be serious and discipline
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.200]   yourselves for the sake of your prayers. Above all, maintain constant love for one another,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:38.160]   for love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one other without complaining. Like good
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.600]   stewards of the manifold grace of God, serve one another with whatever gift each of you has
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.680]   received. Whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of God. Whoever serves
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.200]   must likewise do so with the strength that God supplies so that God may be glorified in all
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.080]   things through Jesus Christ. To Him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen."
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.240]   Now at first glance, this might seem like it has nothing to do with what we're talking about,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.880]   but just as we unpack, I know God's going to reveal. And you know, today I just want you to
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.200]   take away one thing. I'm going to share three things, but I just want you to take away one
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.400]   thing. And so here, Peter is painting a broad picture of life in the early church. Peter was
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:31.760]   encouraging the church to remain faithful and steadfast, to keep on loving each other consistently
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.640]   and constantly, to keep prayerful and vigilant because even though there's persecution, even
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.680]   though we do not know when Jesus is coming back, Peter is saying, "Do not stop meeting like this
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.200]   because we need it." There is an urgency. We don't know what's going to happen, but what we have now
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.280]   is what we need. And so we're going to pick up from verse 9 where he says, "Be hospitable to
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.800]   one another without complaining." Peter here is suggesting that one of the many ways we as
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.720]   Christians can express love to one another without complaining is to be hospitable.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   For Peter and the early church, hospitality was a tremendous privilege. That means it was a
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:20.720]   privilege to express welcome, to offer food, to offer shelter for anyone coming through. For you
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:28.240]   can be a Christian, you can be a stranger. And back then, people offered hospitality to even enemies,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.360]   praying that through this meal, after this meal, the Holy Spirit would work within us and we would
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.960]   leave differently. And so for the early church, in ancient church culture, there was a cultural
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:48.240]   expectation and an obligation to offer hospitality. So scriptures like Acts 14, Hebrews 13,
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:56.160]   says that some, while hosting, while entertaining, have entertained angels without knowing it,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:02.480]   meaning that they were blessed in the presence of whoever came through. In Matthew 25, Jesus says,
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.840]   "By extending your welcome, by extending yourself as an embrace to the stranger, to the believer,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.680]   to the least of these," as in to those who need it, "it's as though you are loving and hosting
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:22.000]   and welcoming the Lord Jesus himself." I take that seriously. I don't know if you've paused to think
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.680]   about that, but it's mind-blowing. And so Jesus promises, actually, that no matter how small or
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:36.400]   slight the kindness that you show the stranger, it will not go unrewarded. So I want to link this
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.560]   back and tie this back to what we're talking about. Is it possible to experience the Spirit both in
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.800]   our life as well as our church life? Now, hospitality is essential. It's a privilege. It's an obligation.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.920]   And it shows our love. And honestly, the truth is, it's difficult. Why? Because it's inconvenient
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.200]   and it takes a lot of effort. Can I actually... This is not scripted, but this is what happened
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.440]   last night. A friend that we haven't seen in a year and a half just decided to surprise us
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.520]   at our house. He brought a gift, and we had no plans of entertaining last night. But you know what?
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:18.080]   Being hospitable is inconvenient. It takes a lot of effort. But you know what? At the end of the night,
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.720]   we were so blessed. I hope our friend was blessed. I don't know. I'll ask him later, right?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:30.240]   But the point is, what if the person we are hosting is the Lord Himself? Would we not make
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:37.680]   that effort? Would all the inconvenience in the world be okay and worth it? The truth is, the Holy
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.480]   Spirit, He doesn't always come announced. I mean, we would like it to be like that, but that's not
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.520]   the case. He shows up unexpectedly, but He also shows up when we are aware, when we acknowledge
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:56.640]   that we are with Him. So if, church, you and I want to host the Spirit, we want to experience the Spirit,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.920]   then what does it mean for us to welcome Him in our thoughts? What does it mean for us
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.880]   to show up to work, show up to school, go back home, and say, "Lord, I want You to come and visit us"?
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.960]   And so, can I propose a very simple way of living, that every time you open up God's Word when you're
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.400]   by yourself, every time you come here, I know sometimes some of you rush to get here, but even so,
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:32.080]   when you wake up, you can say this simple prayer. You can say, "Holy Spirit, You are welcome in this place.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:39.920]   As we gather, Lord, please join us. Come and dwell with us. We want to serve You. We want to worship
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.840]   You. We want to hear everything You have to say to us concerning us about this life, about death,
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:54.640]   about everything. Can we sit down? And if it's okay, Lord, please don't leave yet. Please just stay
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:01.600]   with us." Church, what if this was our collective way of life? What if this habit of welcoming
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.240]   and saying that, "You know what, Lord? It's okay that I'm going to be inconvenienced for the rest
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   of this week. It's okay that I'm going to push back all my scheduling, but if I can host You,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.400]   if I can welcome You and You stay with me, then I think that's worthwhile. That's how I want to live."
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.600]   So, church, we're going to continue to verse 10 and 11. Peter says, "Like good stewards of the
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.200]   manifold grace of God, serve one another with whatever gift each of you have received." I will
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.880]   come back and talk about gifts. "Whoever speaks must do so as one speaking the very words of God.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:42.640]   Whoever serves must do so with the strength that God supplies so that God may be glorified in all
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:50.560]   things through Jesus Christ." Peter reminds the church here, saying that, "For everyone who has
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.720]   come to know the Lord, for everyone who has received the undeserved mercy and graces of God,
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:03.600]   I want you to be diligent and faithful in figuring out what your gift is, and I want you to serve the
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:12.800]   body of Christ because time is short." Jesus is coming back, and He says, "Whatever gift you have,
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:21.040]   use it as God gives you the strength, as God gives you the time and space to lavish and build up the
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:28.080]   church." And Peter calls us to be good stewards because, basically, these gifts are not ours to
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:35.920]   keep. They are given to us so that we could use it lavishly, generously on other people so that
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:44.560]   His church may be healthy and flourishing. And so, what I want to just pull back here and just
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:51.040]   talk about gifts, and I want to take us to 1 Corinthians 12, verse 4-7. The apostle Paul
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:58.880]   teaches that the Holy Spirit gives spiritual gifts to every believer so that every believer
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.600]   has a part and a place within the body of Christ so that the church may continue to be healthy.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:12.240]   And it is our responsibility to figure what that gift is, what the spiritual gift is so that we
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:19.600]   may give. And so, I'm going to quickly go through some of these gifts that the Spirit gives us. I'm
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:27.200]   going to pull from Romans and Corinthians and Thessalonians. And so, the Spirit gives us the
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:35.600]   ability to teach, to minister, as in to serve, to evangelize, to share the good news, to pastor, to
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   provide leadership like our elders and deacons do, to encourage one another, to prophesy. Something
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.640]   we talked about last week is not predicting the future, but to call out the spiritual realities
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.440]   in which we live in, to admonish. Some of us have this gift of being so patient that you can correct
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.120]   me when I am in the wrong. You have that grace about you. That is to correct and admonish,
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:08.960]   to express hospitality, to have mercy, to be generous. And so, church, if we desire, if you
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   and I desire this morning to host the Spirit of God in our private life, as well as here every
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.520]   single day, every single week, then I ask you to take this spiritual reality, what Paul and Peter
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:29.200]   is talking about, seriously, as in you have a gift, but will you use it? You know, every year,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.360]   unfortunately, we talk, and you tell me how burnt out you are, and I completely understand,
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:43.040]   because sometimes we feel that, "Why am I doing everything, and everyone else, they just come?"
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.440]   You know, and likewise, I think it does not fall on Pastor Andrew or the leaders or our small group
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.640]   leaders or our volunteers to make sure that the church is flourishing. All of us have a role,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.000]   and I want you to really be diligent in thinking about this. So, how does this look like? Well,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   personally, let me tell you, it's really simple. Go home, look up every gift that is in the New
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.040]   Testament or Old Testament, and say, "Lord, what have you given me?" And ask Him for the opportunity
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:19.200]   to start serving, start using it for the sake of building up the church, for the sake of sharing
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.360]   with each other and others who do not know Jesus Christ, the mercies of God. So, communally,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.480]   I would encourage the same thing. I would ask you to figure out what your gift is and just
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.680]   serve. When you go to work, when you go to school, when you go home, when you come here,
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:42.560]   when you join your CG, offer to address the needs and meet the needs of others. We can take someone
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.960]   out for coffee. We can pray for them afterwards. We can teach others how to love God. But, you know,
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:55.280]   my boys, they taught me how to resist temptation. We talked about all the practical needs that we
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.880]   would encounter in life. We can show hospitality to those who can never pay us back. We can be
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.680]   a listening ear. We can write a letter of encouragement to someone in prison or someone
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:14.000]   suffering or someone grieving. We can sit with them. And also, we can just extend the mercy that
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.640]   we've received from God and forgive someone who we don't want to forgive.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:25.200]   And so, I want to just highlight one more thing that Peter is talking about here.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:33.920]   Peter wants the church and us to know that our Christian faith is not meant to be a depository
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:41.360]   of everything God has given us. Rather, Peter envisions the church to be channels in which
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.520]   God's grace and everything God has given us that we would be channels and it would flow outwards to
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:55.040]   those who need it, to those who need to experience the love of God. And so, I want to say that we are
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:03.360]   not meant to be depositories or terminals of God's grace, but we are to be channels of Him and
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.840]   everything He wants to do. And we can be channels when we use our gifts, when we come together and
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:17.920]   acknowledge that I have a part to play here, that I can make the Vine Church even healthier or in a
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:25.520]   place where we can receive from God even more if I do this, if I can offer this. And so, church,
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:32.480]   if we come to church and we come to our gatherings focused solely on what we can receive, what we can
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.560]   get of it, and I think there are seasons where that is how, that's okay. But if it becomes a habitual
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:45.920]   way of life and way of thinking, then definitely we will limit, you and I will limit the work of God
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.840]   in our midst. We will limit what God can say to us because we're just so focused on ourselves
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:22:00.240]   and not the others. Last week was a beautiful example of what happened. And actually, Andrew
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:08.400]   asked the staff a week in advance to pray what words and pictures that God might be giving us
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:15.200]   for you, for the church, throughout all three services. And as a response, a lot of us just came
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:23.040]   and just in faith shared. But what happened next was what the Spirit, really what we're talking
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:30.880]   about. You receive the Word of God, you responded, and as an overflow, all of us started praying for
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:38.560]   each other. And so, this is a beautiful example of how God can use each of us to minister, and we
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:46.240]   leave blessed, we leave different, we leave changed. So, when you and I forget that we are members
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.480]   of one another, we neglect the role that we have a gift to give, then we will limit the work of God.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   So, up till now, I think I'm doing okay in time. But I do have one more thing I want to share with
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:09.760]   us. I want to share a habit that we sometimes, a lot of times, practice without knowing that
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.920]   individually we can limit and stifle the work of the Spirit in our own lives. I want to take us to
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:24.480]   1 Thessalonians 5, verse 19. And this here, Paul says, "Do not quench the Holy Spirit."
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:30.240]   I've always been apprehensive and intimidated by this verse, and I've never bothered to actually
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.920]   look into it. But this week, I did because I think it has a contextual relevance for what
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.160]   we're talking about here. Paul was addressing the church to be mindful of our own hearts and our own
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:49.680]   selves, that it is very easy for us not just to limit or to stifle the Spirit's work in our lives,
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.800]   but actually, if the Holy Spirit is a person with personality, that He can be blessed,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:03.040]   He has a character, He can be loved, then equally, like any of us, the Holy Spirit can also be
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:12.800]   grieved. He can be upset. And so, I want to, in a lighthearted manual, but an honest sharing with
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:18.640]   you, I want to just go over what quenches the Spirit, what actually grieves the Spirit. And I
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.160]   want to just disclaimer and say that this, I'm talking about all of us, that this is not, I'm
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:28.560]   not pointing fingers at anyone, I'm actually, this is how we can grieve the Spirit. Our sins,
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:37.040]   the way we selfishly live for ourselves, the fact that a lot of times we ignore,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:43.120]   like blatantly ignore, and we forget that God is here with us, that the Holy Spirit is with us.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:49.440]   Our lack of expectations in life sometimes, that we say, "You know what? I'm just going to coast
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.680]   through life because in a way we've given up." I think this, as a father myself, I would be sad
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:04.560]   if my sons and daughters gave me that attitude. Our idolatry, our preference, our chasing after
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:12.480]   influence and reputation and power and a career over the fact that the Holy Spirit desires to
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:19.600]   spend time with us. Sometimes when we kind of exercise our man-made rules over people,
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.560]   when Jesus has taught us simply how to love each other, how to respect each other, how to forgive.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:32.480]   And for all of us, our words grieve the Spirit, especially when we talk behind someone's back,
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.560]   when we gossip. And because a lot of times we don't want to deal with each other, so we just
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:47.680]   kind of give people the cold shoulders. We use our words hurtfully, and we express an unsympathetic
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.960]   criticism attitude, this spirit of criticism, which will kill anything. And that, I think,
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:00.000]   does grieve the Spirit. So church, I just want to name these few because I think when we knowingly
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.080]   practice this, or we are made aware but we do not repent, then we naturally will stifle,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.240]   and we deceive ourselves from thinking that the Spirit is working within us when He cannot. There
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.520]   is no room. It's not that He doesn't want to, but it's just we're not letting Him because we would
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:29.760]   rather stay in this space. And so with that note, church, I want to bring us back to this question
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:36.560]   that we've been asking ourselves. Can you and I experience the Spirit in both our private life
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:44.320]   and our communal life? And the answer is yes. Yes, we can. It is very possible to experience both
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:54.400]   because, well, because it is possible. But I want to say that it is only possible if we are willing
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.600]   to grow in our awareness, to grow in our relational awareness to how we are currently interacting with
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.680]   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit through Mondays all the way through Sundays. That if you
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:15.600]   and I are able to cultivate and keep a hunger and thirst for the Spirit of God and what He wants to
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:22.320]   do, then yes, definitely, I think we can encounter God every day, all the time, in every season.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.800]   However, church, if we ignore everything I've said, it's not about me, but if we ignore God's
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:35.520]   Word today and what He's saying to us as a church, then God will seem to be only in one place at a
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:41.840]   time and not both. You get me? So I want to summarize and ask you these questions. I want
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.520]   you to take away the three habits that we have that sometimes we limit the work of the Spirit
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.680]   in our life. And I want to just ask you these things again. Maybe you want to write this down.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:57.760]   You can just screen capture this. But I want to ask going forward, will you host and welcome the
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.400]   Spirit of God in your life? Whether you're reading the Word yourself, whether you're coming here,
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:09.040]   whether you're going somewhere with human beings, will you say, "Lord, I want to welcome you. Would
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:16.800]   you come with me? Would you come with us?" Second question I want to ask us is, will you commit to
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:24.640]   being channels of God's grace and His work and His mercy in your life rather than be terminals,
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:31.440]   than to be destinations? And I want to ask you, will you quench the Spirit? I mean, actually,
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.880]   I worded that wrong because we will grieve the Spirit, but what will we do about that?
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.720]   So church, I want you just to stand with me. I want to pray for us before we go.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.280]   I want to pray for you online. I want to pray for you if you're outside in the overflow.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:57.680]   And I'm just going to list out some habits, and if that is you, I want you maybe just,
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.440]   if you can just focus, maybe you can just maybe close your eyes, maybe you can just ignore
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:07.680]   the person beside you. I want you just to maybe open your hands if this is you.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:17.120]   If you desire to see the Spirit's work more in your personal life and your congregational life,
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:22.960]   if you want to grow in this awareness of the fact that reality that the Holy Spirit is with us
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   everywhere we go, and He is constantly wanting to spend time and speak to us, if that is you,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.720]   if you want to be more aware, then I want you just to open up your hands
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.320]   while no one is looking. It's between you and the Lord.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.440]   And I think for some of us, if you are really scared of being inconvenienced,
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:52.960]   you are scared of putting in the extra effort, you are scared of failing. What if I do this
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.560]   wrong? What if I don't get it? I'm not mature enough. I'm not spiritually experienced enough
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:04.800]   to host, to serve, to give. If that is you, I just want you to open up your hands.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:15.920]   If in our time today you realize that you may have grieved the Spirit in your life,
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:22.400]   in your thought life, in how you treated others, I don't want you to condemn yourself right now,
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:28.160]   but I want you to remind you that the Holy Spirit does not condemn you. He is gentle,
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:34.080]   He is steadfast and faithful to show this to you so that you may no longer limit,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.280]   but rather you can empower and say, "Lord, would you come?"
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.760]   And so if this is you right now, you know that you've grieved the Spirit,
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:48.800]   then would you pray with me? If you want to be more aware, would you pray with me? If you want to,
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.760]   starting now, to host and welcome the Spirit wherever you go, then would you pray with me?
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.960]   We're going to pray Psalm 139 together, as David said.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.480]   So Lord, would you search our hearts right now, oh God, because you know our hearts.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.760]   Would you show us if there are any thoughts or ways or habits that limit and stifle your work,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.880]   your good and loving work in our life, then would you turn us away from that?
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.480]   Would you help us, empower us to do something different so that we do not limit your work,
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:28.880]   but we rather enable and welcome you to continue to stay with us and work with us?
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.160]   And would you lead us towards you, Father?
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:39.520]   And so Lord, we ask that as we go from here, as a response, Lord God,
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.560]   would we be channels of your mercy and your grace?
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.160]   Father, we desperately yearn to experience you both in our faith,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:53.920]   just as we can experience you together, Father, that there'll be no difference
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.760]   because you are through and through here with us and for us.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.480]   You work and minister through us.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.800]   So Father, we surrender ourselves and we want to now just give ourselves to you.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.040]   So church, as we respond, as we worship, before you leave here,
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.480]   say, Lord, I want to be a channel.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.320]   I want to welcome you. I want to host you.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.760]   That is my prayer for the rest of this life.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.320]   And so Father, we thank you for hearing us.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.760]   Thank you for your word.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:33.360]   Would you be glorified in our midst as we be channels of your love and grace in this world,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.640]   in this city, in this time, Jesus, in your name we pray.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.920]   Amen.
