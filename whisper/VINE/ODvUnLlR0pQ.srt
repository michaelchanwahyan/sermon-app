1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Thank you, Pastor Ellison.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 As he shared, we know each other for a long time.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,640
 He's actually the one that also brought me to the Vine Church.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,800
 But it's so good to be with you this morning.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,220
 Let me start with what God has put on my heart for you all.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,080
 When I was a freshman in university, they announced in chapel that you could sign up

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,640
 for community groups.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,000
 And it sounded like a good thing to me, so I signed up for one.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,280
 They told us our group leader will be in touch and give us all the information about our

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
 group.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,280
 So I got the details about our first meeting.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,680
 And when I show up, there's John from my hallway that I really struggled with.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,000
 Our personalities, they were so different.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,380
 And I had difficulty listening to him and being patient with him.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,560
 And quite frankly, loving him as a Christian brother, as my "die-hing."

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,120
 Now I knew right then that God placed John in my group because he wanted me to learn

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,760
 to love and appreciate this brother who's made in the image of God, whom Jesus died

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,360
 for and gave everything for.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,520
 But truth be told, I very much struggled to have patience with and love.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,760
 And perhaps you have a John in your life right now, maybe a neighbor you don't like, a colleague

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,280
 whom you can't stand, a family member that drives you crazy.

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,440
 I feel like we all have that.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:37,160
 A church member that rubs you the wrong way, or perhaps even a pastor that bugs you.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,680
 So someone that you struggle to love and to care for and to show God's patience and compassion

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
 to.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,000
 Or maybe there are people in your sphere of influence that you already love, but you're

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,720
 very well aware that there are times where you miss the mark and you hurt and disappoint

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,320
 those you love.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,360
 We all have those moments where we realize we are not as loving of a person as we hope

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,300
 to be.

31
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,160
 Or think of your relationship with God.

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,080
 There probably isn't a week that goes by where we love God in the way that we wish and desire

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,440
 to.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,840
 Now this series that we are in is called Flourish, and it's all about deepening your spiritual

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,880
 foundation and disciplines in order for you to have a more mature relationship with Jesus.

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,520
 And this week we are taking a look at the ingredient of community.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,680
 And in particular the idea that community is essentially our experience and exercise

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,640
 of love towards God and towards our neighbor.

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,360
 Now one of the major ways that we as Christians are called to grow in love according to Jesus

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,480
 is to love our neighbor and to love him.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,360
 And that's our highest calling.

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,080
 And Jesus, he put it this way.

43
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,160
 He said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,740
 all your mind."

45
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,840
 And this is the first and greatest commandment.

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,600
 And the second is like it.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,440
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,400
 So we are meant to love God and reflect God's love in our relationships with those inside

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,760
 but also outside the Christian community.

50
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,500
 But we so often miss the mark of loving God and loving others.

51
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,660
 So today we're talking about being shaped by God's love through community.

52
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:48,600
 And God wants to form us into more loving, less critical, and more gracious people.

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,120
 And so today I want to explore with you in this message how do we become more loving?

54
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,180
 How do we grow in this Christ-like love?

55
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,840
 And what role does community play in all this?

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,600
 We're going to get really practical today.

57
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,560
 And so towards the end of the message I'm going to be talking about our spiritual formation

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,880
 toolkit where we'll share some concrete steps that you can take as you seek to grow in love

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,080
 and faith through community.

60
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,120
 So does that sound good?

61
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
 Great.

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,240
 So let's turn to an episode in Jesus' life that will provide some answers to these questions

63
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
 that we're exploring.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,400
 We're going to be looking at a biblical account of Jesus being anointed for burial by a woman.

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,520
 And let me provide you with a little context.

66
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,560
 Jesus is in his last days before the crucifixion.

67
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,680
 Just prior to our passage we learn that the religious leaders, they plan to kill Jesus.

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,240
 And right after our passage we learn that Judas, one of Jesus' own disciples, will turn

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,280
 on him and aid the religious leaders in betraying Jesus.

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,660
 So the story of the woman anointing Jesus and expressing her devotion and love stands

71
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,620
 in strong contrast to the hostility that Jesus is facing at this time.

72
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,880
 So this is not the typical Bible passage that people draw on when they talk about growing

73
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
 in love through community.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,080
 But I believe that there's an angle from which we can look at this story that will shed some

75
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,400
 light on how we can grow in love through community.

76
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,880
 So we're in Mark chapter 14 and verse 3.

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,640
 It says, "And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,880
 at a table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly.

79
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,800
 And she broke the flask and poured it over his head.

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,000
 There were some who said to themselves, 'Why was the ointment wasted like that?

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,800
 For this ointment could have been sold for more than 300 denarii and given to the poor.'

82
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,940
 And they scolded her.

83
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,400
 But Jesus said, 'Leave her alone.

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,440
 Why do you trouble her?

85
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,880
 She has done a beautiful thing to me.

86
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,080
 For you always have the poor with you.

87
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,640
 And whenever you want, you can do good for them, but you will not always have me.

88
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,520
 She has done what she could.

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,400
 She has anointed my body beforehand for burial.

90
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,080
 And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she

91
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,280
 has done will be told in memory of her."

92
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,720
 Now what we're going to do is to look at the story and see what different characters in

93
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,400
 the story teach us about how God works through community in our lives, to shape us into people

94
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,480
 who reflect his love in a more consistent way.

95
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,340
 So first there's the woman that anoints Jesus.

96
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,640
 She walks into Simon the leper's house where there are men hanging out, and she's disregarding

97
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,240
 cultural conventions by stepping in that space.

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,720
 I mean, it's quite a courageous thing to do.

99
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
 And there's something that moves her to do this.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,800
 The one thing that is clear is that her actions of walking into the house and anointing Jesus

101
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,700
 is an act of her love and devotion to Jesus.

102
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,360
 Even though the gospel of Mark, it does not tell us, but it's safe to assume that Jesus

103
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,600
 through this ministry deeply touched this woman's life.

104
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,400
 So in response to who Jesus is and what he has done, she expresses her love and devotion

105
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
 by anointing him in this beautiful and lavish way.

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,000
 She breaks the neck of the jar, which actually was technically not necessary, and she pours

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
 that ointment over him.

108
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,000
 And it was a dramatic gesture which demonstrated the woman's unreserved devotion to Jesus,

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,600
 holding nothing back whenever we respond to what God is doing in our lives with acts of

110
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,680
 love and devotion to him.

111
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,160
 It is a beautiful thing.

112
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
 Now I don't know if you ever have been touched and inspired in your love for Jesus and neighbor

113
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,400
 by other people in your community.

114
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
 I certainly have.

115
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,360
 When I moved from Germany to the US as a 17 year old, it was the first time that I experienced

116
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,480
 an intentional Christian community.

117
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,800
 I was inspired especially by my host brother Dave's passion and love for Jesus.

118
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,000
 I mean his love for Jesus, it awoken me to desire.

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,760
 I wanted to know Jesus.

120
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,440
 I wanted to spend more time with him.

121
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,680
 So community is a place where our faith and love for Jesus and for others is strengthened

122
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,720
 and can even be set on fire.

123
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,640
 Seeing this love in others often makes us draw near to Jesus because we want to know

124
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,440
 Jesus in that same way too.

125
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
 We want to love Jesus in that same way.

126
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,720
 So whose love for Jesus have you been touched and inspired by?

127
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,720
 Now being inspired and touched by this woman's act of love and devotion to Jesus could have

128
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,540
 been a response by the people watching the woman anoint Jesus.

129
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,720
 But that's not how they respond.

130
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,240
 You have this beautiful act of love and devotion and immediately you have the haters line up

131
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,400
 to hit on her.

132
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,240
 New Testament professor Tom Wright, he kind of comments on this this way.

133
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:52,240
 He says, "It always happens when people decide to worship Jesus without an ambition, to pour

134
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,560
 out their valuables, their stories, their dancing, their music before him, just the

135
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:07,800
 way they feel like doing that others looking on find the spectacle embarrassing and distasteful.

136
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,960
 Whenever there are acts of love and devotion done for Jesus, criticism often follows."

137
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,440
 Now it's interesting because the criticism against the woman is actually couched in spiritual

138
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 language.

139
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,280
 So in verse 4 and 5 it says, "There were some who said to themselves indignantly, 'Why was

140
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,440
 the ointment wasted like that?

141
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,480
 For this ointment could have been sold for more than 300 denarii, a lot of money, and

142
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,340
 given to the poor.'

143
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,120
 And they scolded her."

144
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,040
 Now it's easy to use pious excuses to condemn and judge other people.

145
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,200
 You know it sounds very spiritual to talk about the money that could have been given

146
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,120
 to the poor.

147
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,860
 Talking about not wasting resources, I mean it sounds like good economics.

148
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,320
 But what is being missed in this context is what the woman actually sees.

149
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,000
 And it's about that Jesus is about to lay his life down at the cross for all humanity's

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 sake.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,120
 What is being missed here is the heart and giving and expressing her devotion to Jesus.

152
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,440
 But in the sacred moment of all of this is not seen.

153
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,480
 Now what was the last time you were critical or judgmental of someone?

154
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,200
 When was the last time you spiritually judged another person's action using your language

155
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,960
 or spiritual language to critique their intentions?

156
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,720
 What did you fail to see when you were judging the person?

157
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,840
 Because there's always a broader context.

158
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,240
 Now I love how Jesus reacts to those who judge the woman.

159
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:57,000
 He responds by guarding the sacred moment of love and devotion expressed to him.

160
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,040
 But he does it in such a way that it does not cut off the critics from community and

161
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:08,160
 relationship with him, but rather invites them to examine their hearts.

162
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,760
 Now there's four ways that Jesus guards the sacred moment.

163
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,440
 First, Jesus defends the woman and tells those who are scolding her, "Leave her alone and

164
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,640
 stop troubling her."

165
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,960
 Second, where is the man Jesus is sharing a meal with that they're criticizing the woman

166
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,560
 for anointing him?

167
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,720
 Jesus affirms what she has done as a beautiful thing done to him.

168
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,960
 And he does not let the critics' negative judgment stand, but he affirms her act of

169
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,320
 love and devotion.

170
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,520
 And third, Jesus does not just tell those judging the woman to stop, but he also explains

171
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,200
 what the critics have missed.

172
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,280
 Jesus exposes this false spirituality and lack of love when he says, "For you always

173
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,080
 have the poor with you.

174
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,400
 And whenever you want, you can do good for them, but you will not always have me."

175
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,440
 So Jesus is saying that the poor are always the Christian community's responsibility,

176
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,940
 and that no one is stopping them from giving money to the poor or helping them.

177
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,120
 And so it's a little too convenient to talk about what others should be doing for those

178
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,440
 living in poverty instead of taking actions themselves.

179
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,360
 So Jesus explains what the critics have missed.

180
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,040
 They have missed their own lack of action and caring for the poor, and they have missed

181
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,920
 the significance of this moment, which served as his anointing for burial before his death

182
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,400
 that Jesus was about to die on the cross.

183
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,360
 That did not miss the significance of this, but the critics did.

184
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,800
 And Jesus did not have to explain all of this, but he chose to because he wanted to invite

185
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:09,720
 the critics to let go of judgment and to surrender to the love and grace of Jesus.

186
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:17,160
 Finally, Jesus does not only defend the woman, but he celebrates her.

187
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,660
 He celebrates what she has done.

188
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,920
 She will be known.

189
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:28,360
 Her act and devotion of love and willingness to courageously anoint Jesus will be forever

190
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,280
 memorialized and celebrated.

191
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,120
 They're part of the gospel.

192
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,600
 So Jesus does not let the sacred moment to be destroyed.

193
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,520
 Instead he makes sure that the beauty of this love and devotion of this woman will be remembered

194
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
 forever.

195
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,000
 And in fact, we are remembering it right now.

196
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,280
 Isn't that awesome?

197
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:59,200
 So what do the woman, the critics and Jesus teach us about how we can grow more through

198
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
 community?

199
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:08,160
 First, we learned from the woman that a person's love and devotion to Jesus has the potential

200
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,560
 to inspire love and devotion towards Jesus and others.

201
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,320
 My host brother David's love for Jesus and others inspired me to grow into more of a

202
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,440
 loving person and to love my neighbors more.

203
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,360
 Who in your community is inspiring you to love Jesus and others?

204
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,760
 Who are you inspiring with your love and devotion to Jesus?

205
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,800
 Second, living in community brings out the best and the worst in us.

206
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,360
 In the critics' case, the woman's extraordinary love and devotion brought out their judgment,

207
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,080
 criticalness and lack of love.

208
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,000
 Now, truth be told, we all to one degree or another judge and condemn others.

209
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,640
 And it's especially in community where a lack of love and grace surfaces.

210
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,440
 Sometimes we're made aware of our lack of love by members of the community.

211
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,240
 They might tell us that just like Jesus did with the critics.

212
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,520
 And other times it might be the Holy Spirit convicting us.

213
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,440
 And maybe the Holy Spirit is convicting you right now.

214
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:23,480
 It is these moments of failure to love that provide an unexpected opportunity to grow

215
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,120
 in love.

216
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,640
 These moments are an opportunity for healing and growth when we come to terms with them

217
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,520
 and own them.

218
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,880
 You know, we think that we grow in love by working harder.

219
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,560
 I'm going to try harder, but that's actually not how it works.

220
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,520
 If we try to be less critical and judgmental out of our own strength, you know, we're going

221
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,000
 to fail.

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,180
 But instead of trying to love more out of our own strength, my question is, will you

223
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:05,640
 surrender to God's love and spend time with him and allow yourself to be loved by God?

224
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:14,920
 Take some time to ask God to give you the grace to love those whom you struggle to love.

225
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,320
 Richard Rohr, a well-known Christian author, he puts it like this.

226
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,400
 Most of us were taught that God would love us if and when we change.

227
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,520
 In fact, God loves you so that you can change.

228
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,040
 What empowers change, what makes you desire is of change is the experience of love.

229
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 It is that inherent experience of love that becomes the engine for change.

230
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,960
 You know, in Romans it says, "For it's your kindness that leads us to repentance."

231
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,280
 It's God's love that is the engine of change.

232
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,760
 So surrendering to love is the comeback into the arms of our heavenly father.

233
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,240
 He does not scold us for failing to love, but he welcomes you.

234
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,640
 He restores you.

235
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,520
 He embraces you.

236
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,460
 And surrendering to love is to receive God's love and forgiveness, his grace.

237
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,080
 It is his love and grace that transforms, you know, as we sit in God's presence and

238
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,320
 commune with him and just spend time with him.

239
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,480
 This is what transforms us, not our trying harder.

240
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:33,680
 No, God wants to release us from our own efforts of conjuring up or manufacturing this love

241
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,640
 out of our own strength.

242
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,920
 And as a community of faith, we actually get to remind each other of our heavenly father's

243
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,480
 love that is so radical and unlike human love.

244
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,240
 We remind ourselves of the truth that we love not out of our own strength, but relying on

245
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,820
 God's strength and our experience of being loved by God.

246
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:07,200
 As Apostle John in 1 John 4, 19 put it, "We love because he first loved us."

247
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,000
 When we run out of love, we turn to God who never runs out of love.

248
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,920
 Our failures to love and along the way, our opportunities again to surrender to Jesus,

249
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:30,320
 who is working and shaping and forming us through this grace into more loving people,

250
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,800
 people that are more consistently reflect his love and grace.

251
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,720
 That is what happened with me when I was in community group with John in university.

252
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,680
 Throughout a two-year period of time, God changed my heart and gave me the grace and

253
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,760
 the strength to learn to love John who had such a different personality from me and came

254
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
 from a different cultural background.

255
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,560
 And it was a process of surrendering to God's love and grace on a regular basis that enabled

256
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,360
 me to do so.

257
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,600
 Now I've experienced how God has grown me spiritually through community.

258
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,120
 And right now I want to share with you about this week's Spiritual Formation Toolkit, Live

259
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,700
 in Community.

260
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:25,320
 So like we've seen in the first two weeks, the Community Toolkit is broken into action

261
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,800
 steps and going deeper.

262
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,040
 Let me just highlight a few things in each to give you a sense of what is in this week's

263
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
 tool.

264
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,320
 For action steps, we have a document that's called "Why Invest Yourself in Christian Community."

265
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,840
 We also have a link to our sermon series, "A Call to Community" that can help you to

266
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,200
 understand the importance of Christian community.

267
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
 So maybe you have questions around that.

268
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,040
 That's a good place to start.

269
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,080
 We also have a link to our community group map where you can explore groups and sign

270
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,400
 up for them and join them.

271
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,400
 And just as a reminder, some of the pins on the map, they actually have multiple groups.

272
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,120
 So make sure you scroll on them and see if there's other groups there.

273
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,280
 Also if you want to start a group in your school, work, or a parent's group, or maybe

274
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,880
 in your home, you can email us at cg@divine.org.hk.

275
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,040
 You know, we want to explore that possibility with you and support you to get those communities

276
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,960
 started.

277
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,900
 For going deeper, we have a workshop on how you can become a river connector who helps

278
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,160
 other people connect to community.

279
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,240
 You can check out the QR code and find out more information there.

280
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,440
 If bringing people together brings you joy, I want to encourage you to sign up for this

281
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,360
 practical workshop on how you can use your gift to connect people to various expressions

282
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,440
 of community here at the Vine.

283
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,720
 So this workshop is happening on the 11th of March, 8 to 9 p.m.

284
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,520
 So check that out if that's for you.

285
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,480
 We also suggest resources for those of you who want to go deeper into community, maybe

286
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,320
 with a friend or a group of people.

287
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,200
 And I'm just going to highlight one of those resources.

288
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,400
 It's by the author James Bryan Smith, and he's written a beautiful trilogy that's called

289
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:29,120
 The Good and Beautiful God, The Good and Beautiful Life, and The Good and Beautiful Community.

290
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,320
 Each book has a small group discussion guide in the back of the book and has practical

291
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,000
 exercises on how you can grow in your relationship with God, how you can become a more Christlike

292
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,280
 person, and how you can grow in loving your neighbor.

293
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,160
 So I want to encourage you to take a look at the Spiritual Formation Toolkit, Live in

294
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,920
 Community, and invest in your own and other spiritual growth by taking one suggested step,

295
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,880
 and then just see what God does, how he works through that as you take that step.

296
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,520
 So as I draw today to a close, I want to leave you with a personal story that I believe illustrates

297
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:20,120
 how Jesus modeled love and grace to both the woman that anointed him, but also her critics.

298
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:25,320
 Broken God makes his love tangible to us through community so that we can experience it and

299
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 receive it.

300
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,360
 In 2017, I went through the toughest time of my life, loss of relationship, loss of

301
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,460
 work, and loss of my home.

302
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,480
 And when this happened, it really made me question God's love for me.

303
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,560
 And in my brokenness and shame and loss, I wondered if God still loved me.

304
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,160
 And the signs, they seemed to point in another direction.

305
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,800
 But it was through community that God showed me his love.

306
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:05,160
 It was the people around me that made God's love believable and tangible in my life.

307
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,760
 Let me tell you about Akbar, Regina, and Kailani, their daughter.

308
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,360
 When I had seemingly lost everything, they took me into their home.

309
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:25,160
 They did not just give me a room to sleep in, but they welcomed me into their family.

310
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,880
 And when I had lost a family, they were family for me.

311
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,000
 Now Regina, she was highly pregnant during that time.

312
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,960
 And when it came close to giving birth, I asked her, "Are you sure you want me to stay

313
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,240
 here during that time?"

314
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,080
 And she assured me that they wanted me there.

315
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,760
 And I was a mess.

316
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,320
 Tears were frequent.

317
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,680
 I didn't even know how I could possibly move forward with my life.

318
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,160
 I didn't know what to do.

319
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,120
 But in the midst of all of that, they showed me hints of God's unconditional love by welcoming

320
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,960
 me to be part of their family.

321
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:14,040
 It's this family, my community, that made God's love tangible for me in a season where

322
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,400
 I had every reason to doubt God's love.

323
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,320
 And they contributed in a major way to God healing deep wounds and hurts in my life.

324
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,440
 And I honestly don't know where I would be today without them.

325
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,960
 When I moved to Hong Kong in 2018 and moved out of their house, it was the first time

326
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,720
 in my life that I cried when I said goodbye to someone.

327
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,240
 I usually don't do that, even though I'm crying right now.

328
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,320
 But God, I know why I cried.

329
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,160
 It was because their love was a reflection of God's love for me.

330
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,760
 And God is fiercely in love with you.

331
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,800
 And he wants you to know that.

332
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,000
 And he uses community to show you that.

333
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,440
 And I have a sense that some of you, the Holy Spirit is nudging to take the step of joining

334
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,940
 a community.

335
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,520
 Don't wait any longer.

336
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,240
 Just do it.

337
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,000
 Let God work through community in your life.

338
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,080
 But there's also a sense that some of you are called, like Akbar and Regina, to be community

339
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,380
 to others and to let God's love and grace flow through you to people who are struggling

340
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,480
 to believe God's love right now.

341
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,880
 You know, and the awesome thing about that is you can do that anywhere.

342
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,500
 It doesn't have to be in a traditional small group.

343
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,260
 You can do that in your workplace.

344
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,600
 You can be community for people, you can be community for people in your family, your

345
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,920
 extended family.

346
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,380
 You can be community for people in your neighborhood.

347
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,700
 Will you step into community and be known?

348
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,800
 Will you be community for others so that they might know God's unconditional love through

349
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 you?

350
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,520
 Let me pray for us.

351
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:18,560
 Jesus, I thank you so much that you call us into community and that you want us to give

352
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,460
 us a community where we can experience just your love.

353
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,280
 And sometimes we're the ones that make that love tangible to others and sometimes we're

354
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,840
 the ones who need that love made tangible to us.

355
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,280
 And so I just ask, Lord, that you know everyone who's watching and what they need, will you

356
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,760
 just speak to them right now and just show them what you're asking them to do, whether

357
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,200
 it's just to be community for others or take that step of stepping into community.

358
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,840
 Now also pray, Lord, that you will make your love tangible to them.

359
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,440
 Those who are right now are struggling and doubting God's love for them or even wonder

360
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,880
 if you are even there.

361
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,760
 I pray that you will show them your love through us, the Vine family, that we can be community

362
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
 for others.

363
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,400
 And I pray that in your name, Jesus.

364
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,900
 Amen.

365
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:20,900
