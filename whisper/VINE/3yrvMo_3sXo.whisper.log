[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Church, once again, it's good to see this room filled.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   My name is Justin, one of the pastors here, and I just want to, on behalf of the church,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   welcome everyone, especially if you're tuning in for the very first time.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   This is your first time. Welcome.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Likewise for everyone here, if you came with a friend, if you're curious, you came.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   If for a miraculous reason you're here, we're glad you're here.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I want to give a special shout out to our youth. Flight is here.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I know you guys are all around.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And so every Sunday, Flight joins us for service, so it's awesome to have you guys with us.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Yeah, so I just want to welcome everyone.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And can I see a show of hands if you were here last week,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   whether you're watching online or you tuned in, were you guys here?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Can I see you? Higher, higher. Yeah, don't be shy.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   All right, that's almost everyone.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Hey, Pastor Andrew's going to speak into this, but I just want to say last Sunday was beautiful.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Now, it might have been a bit hard at the beginning. What? Like pray for people?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   But actually, you know what? This is what church is supposed to be.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   This is the normal Christian life.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   So if you missed last Sunday, I want to encourage you to go back last week,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   and you can re-listen to Pastor Andrew's message, but also just watch till the end,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   because what we did together, what we experienced is the norm.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And it is our prayer that together we can build and rebuild a culture out of the fifth wave
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   so that we can live out what we read in the Bible. Amen?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Okay, so if you're new here, this is the church that we want to continue to be.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And for everyone else, if you are curious, if you have questions,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   there's many ways that you can connect with us.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   You can email us, info@divine.org. We'll answer you.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   The best way, I always say this, is to ask the person sitting beside you.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   If you have questions, if you want to know, we are a big church.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   If you have questions, you want to get involved, you want to know our history,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   maybe they can--I hope you guys can share enough, you know, that will get our new friends curious.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   But also, we have a Connect Hub outside.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   We are there just to connect you. If you want to get involved, if you want to serve,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   then please stick around.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And today, you know, in the last while, we've been exiting through the fire escape.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And I just want to say that last Sunday was the last time you'll ever do that.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So we want to just remind you not to rush.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We don't actually want you to rush out of here.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Even if you have plans, we don't want you to rush out.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   But basically today, we're all going to exit the church the same way you came up.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And one of the reasons why is we want you just to stick around.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   We want you to chat.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Because sometimes, like, leaving through the fire escape just feels like we need to leave immediately.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And we want to change that once again. We're trying to change our culture.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And so I think that is--oh, yes, and also serving.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You know, in the last few weeks, we've been asking you if for those of you who are looking for a place to serve,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   we actually have many opportunities throughout the service and also throughout the week.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But going back to what I was just saying, you know, like we're trying to just live out the word together.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   We're trying to just regather what it is to be a Christian.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   You know, actually to be served, I think all of us need to serve.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   All of us can't just receive and receive.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   We actually need outlets to give.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And so I just want to ask each of you, if you call the Vine your home church, just to discern how you are to serve.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We're not asking you to all serve at the church, right?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But actually I want to ask you to serve--how do you want to serve at work?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   How do you want to serve in your home place?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   How do you want to serve with your energy and the resources, everything that's given to you?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And it takes discernment.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But for those of you who want to serve at the Vine, once again, just scan the QR code and you can continue to figure that out.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I'm going to invite Pastor Andrew, and we're going to pray together.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Good morning, everyone. How are you guys doing?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Everybody okay?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So I think many of us in this room will recognize and know that yesterday, June 4th, was an important date in Hong Kong and China's shared history.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And here at the Vine, you know, we've always wanted to be a church that responds pastorally in moments and events that take place in our city.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   We're a church that's called to be on behalf of the city.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And so when our city is going through something, we always want to be a pastoral response.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And so what we're going to do today is I wanted to create some space in our service to pray for you to have some chance to reflect.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I'm going to create some space in the prayer time for you to be able to bring your own prayers.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   We're going to have a time of silence together where you can bring your own reflection and prayer.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And then I'm going to finish this time in praying a blessing both over Hong Kong and also over China as we move forward in a shared history together.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So I wonder whether you would just bow your heads with me, close your eyes, and let us pray.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Dear Lord Jesus, we come as a community to you this morning as we reflect on the tragic and heartbreaking events of 33 years ago.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   We invite you to come now and to minister to us through both scripture and prayer.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Psalm 86 says, "Hear us, Lord, and answer us, for you guard our lives and you have mercy on us.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   For you, Lord, are forgiving and good. You abound in love to all who call on you."
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So we come today and we call on you to meet us in this time of reflection and prayer.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   We acknowledge the many feelings that are in this room and in our city at this time.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Those who are grieving, mourning, remembering, feeling forgotten or unheard.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   We ask, Lord, that you would be present with them in this time.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That you would be merciful to them, helping them to know your love and your goodness.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Lord, we also pray for any in Hong Kong this weekend who are in need of peace.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   We recognize our call to be peacemakers as children of God.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And so today we pray for this peace.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   That as his church we would be a pastoral presence for any in our city who face trauma, tragedy or struggle.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Psalm 86 also says, "But you, Lord, are compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Show us your strength on behalf of your servants."
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So Father, we ask today for your strength in this time.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   We ask for your compassion, your grace and your faithfulness to be found in us.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So that we may be strong as your servants to any in our society who are in need of care in this time.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   We will now have a time of silence for you to be able to bring your own reflections and prayers at this time.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   [Silence]
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Father, we give you these prayers of ours and we lay them down at your feet as an offering before you.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   We thank you that you hear each and every one of them.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And that you always respond to the prayers of your people.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   We finish our time of prayer by asking for a blessing to come to our city of Hong Kong and to the broader nation of China.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We know that there are many lords still in China that are in need of the gospel.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   We pray for a blessing to be on the church in China to be able to rise up and share and be your hands and feet in this time.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   We also recognize the many in Hong Kong who still also need to hear of Jesus.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Lord, we pray that your church in this city would also be strong.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   That we would be able to proclaim the gospel in Hong Kong and in China in our shared history as we move forward together.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Everyone says? Amen.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Thank you guys so much for praying. That's so important for us just to take that time.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   You know, today, June 5th, is also a very important day in the diary because it's Justin Ho's birthday today.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Like, yeah, yeah, I know.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So can we sing happy birthday?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Happy birthday to you.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Happy birthday to you.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Happy birthday dear Justin.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Happy birthday to you. Yay!
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Alright, I'm going to pray for you Justin.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   40 years old today. 40 years young!
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I know!
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Justin reminded me earlier that he served here at the Vine.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   We've served alongside each other since he was 29.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So it's been a wonderful time and I know that there will be many years ahead.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Let me pray for you my friend.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Father, we thank you for birthdays and we thank you for this man and for his faithfulness to this city.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   His faithfulness to this congregation, this people.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   His faithfulness to us as a leadership and on leadership here at the Vine.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So I just want to pray a blessing for him, for Patsy, for the kids.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You'd fill him today as he celebrates this day of his birth.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And we just thank you for this in your name.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Amen. Amen.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Thank you. That was not expected.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I'm ready to go guys now.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Actually, I have a few more announcements and then we're going to take up our offering.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And Pastor Andrew is going to come and give today's word for us.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so just a few things.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   For June 12th, next Sunday, two important things are going to happen.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   One is our EGM where we're going to hopefully, for us voting members,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   we're going to vote in our new elder, Sky Sue.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And so that's going to be exciting.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   So if you want to join, please, you can just fill out a form and you can actually be able to vote Sky in.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   And another thing is going to happen starting next Sunday.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Are you ready for this?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   We are going to downsize our services a little.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Rather than having four services, we're going to have three services.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   We're going to have the 9, 15, 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And we've realized recently, we've discerned and we've seen that we just have lower numbers in the 2 p.m. services.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And therefore, it just kind of makes sense to consolidate, put together the 2 and the 4 p.m.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And once, you know, we'll see how things go and we'll announce once again when we have four services.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   But starting next Sunday, we're going to have 9, 15, 11 and 2.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Is that okay?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   But for those of you watching online, continue to join us at 11 a.m.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I think that's right. Yes.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   All right.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And, you know, I think in the last while, all of us have postponed a lot of things, especially I think a lot of us getting married.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   You know, last year has been difficult.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I know there's a lot more weddings.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And another thing that we had to postpone since last month and it's been a long while is our flight relaunch, which is happening today in Wan Chai Park at 1 p.m.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And so if you are a teenager, you want to check out flight.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   If you are a parent of a teenager, if you're a parent of a teen to be, if you want to serve our teens, if you want to serve at flight,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   today is actually a really great opportunity to meet Pastor Grace, to meet our other youth and parents.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And that's happening after service, 1 p.m.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And Grace, can you just say hi?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Can you stand up just to say hi?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   This is Pastor Grace.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   And she did say at any time, go back, you know, go to her.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And if you see her here, go and say hi.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   She would love to answer any questions you have about flight and what she does and who she is.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And, yeah, so we welcome that.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   The last announcement is very important is this Tuesday, we are going to have an all-church prayer meeting.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   We haven't had this in a long while.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And this is one of our first ones.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And we are going to have it both physical and online.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   So we would just basically love to see everyone there.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   We're going to pray for our church plant.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   We're going to pray for the next year as Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And the many of you who are going to volunteer, we want to hear God together.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We want to lean in and see what he is saying to us as we prepare this year.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   So it's going to be 730 here in the auditorium until 930 and also 730 online.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   So please, please do join us.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Please clear out your schedule.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   We would love to see you guys there.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And I think just with this church meeting, this prayer meeting, as well as offering that we're about to take,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   I just want to say once again, last week is announced how much you have given, you know, how much we've raised on Vision Sunday.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Our goal target was 5.8 and we have 6.3, right?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So Pastor Tim, Pastor Ivan and the whole team will have a whole year where they can just focus on discipleship building.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   They can just pray.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   They can actually have that space to not worry about finances.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And so, but this comes out of your generosity.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   This is a miracle.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Like I keep on telling people in the last two weeks, like this is crazy.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And we've had the lowest numbers.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Well, we had pretty low numbers.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Like we had like 800, 900 people for that Sunday.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But yet God, through your generosity, really just, yeah, just helped us.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   So church, I want to pray as we give, as we continue just to really discern how God wants us to give,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   whether through a church plant, whether through your own lives.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   So church, would you pray with me?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And afterwards, Pastor Andrew is going to come up.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Father, we give you our lives again.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   We surrender the things that you've given us.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   We also surrender our energy and the things that we hope to give, Lord God.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We pray that you would show each of us how to be generous like you, how to continue to lay down our life to serve,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   how to continue to emulate your son, Jesus, in our lives and reflect that so that the world may know that there is a God,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   that there is grace, that is redemption, and that there is a church who longs to just share the good news.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And so, Father, would you be glorified through our giving.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   In your name we pray. Amen.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Amen. Can we thank Justin for all that he is, all that he does?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Amazing. You can have your Bible.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   So last week, hey, by the way, how are you?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Everybody okay?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   All right. Last week I said to you that I wanted to introduce you to two of the most important and influential people in the New Testament
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   and help you to understand how their story has significantly shaped your own.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And I said last week that the interesting thing about these two people is they are probably people that you're not very familiar with.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And that says something quite beautiful about who God is.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Our God is a God who loves to use people to change history that so often the world very quickly forgets about.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   It's these small people, if you will, that God so often uses for his greatest glory.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   I said last week that large doors so often swing on small little hinges.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And every single person in this room is a small hinge, if you will, for Jesus.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And there's so much that he wants to do in and through us.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   So last week I introduced you to the first of these characters.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I introduced you to Ananias.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Ananias, a person that's only mentioned once, not really mentioned again.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   A person who wasn't particularly powerful or had a big name.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   But someone God chose to go to a house in Damascus, lay his hands on a man called Saul, pray for him,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   see a miracle take place where he goes from blindness to receive sight.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And Saul is transformed into Paul.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And Ananias gets to do this.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And I said last week that every single one of us in this room is an Ananias.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   That the same spirit that was on Ananias in that moment sits and lives inside of us.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   That our great call is to also lay hands on one another, speak truth over each other,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   pray for each other and believe that by the Spirit of God we would come alive together.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And last week as we did that, as I asked you to do that at every single service here,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   it was unbelievable what God did.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   I mean honestly it was one of my most favorite Sundays that we've had here.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I know you're not supposed to have a favorite Sunday, but it's like one of my favorite Sundays for years and years and years.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   As I saw everybody across our four services pray for people.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Like not us pray for you, you pray for you.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And the power of the Spirit in the room doing that was so amazing.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   We got emails in this week from people who were testifying about healings that they'd experienced,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   testifying about salvation.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Some people had shared with some people and they didn't know Jesus or they hadn't given their lives to Jesus
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and salvation took place during that time.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And one gentleman reached out to me and he said, "I'm a Korean and I come to the Vine
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   and I didn't know there were any other Koreans here.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And I was a little bit nervous about praying for people because my English and my Cantonese is not very good.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And the guy sitting next to me was a Korean.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And so we chatted in Korean and prayed together."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And I'm like, "That's awesome."
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   There are quite a lot of Koreans in our church, I just want to say.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   There are.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   But anyway, so that was awesome.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   That was great.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   There was lots of testimonies like that.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And here's the thing that I wanted to say.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   As excited as we were about last week,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   my heart is and my sense is that that was just the tip of the iceberg about what God wants to do amongst us.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   That there's actually so much more by the Spirit of God that He wants to do in a church
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   that genuinely spiritually cares for each other.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And what we're going to do, you know, we're not going to force you to do that every week.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I kind of forced you to do it last week because it was part of being in Ananias.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   But we're not going to do that every week.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   But we want to kind of put a culture in here at the Vine
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   that when you come in on a Sunday, your expectation, your thinking is not,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   "I'm coming in to sit in a chair, to sing some songs, to receive a message and then leave."
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   No, your thinking is, "I'm coming into church because I have something spiritually to contribute
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   to the lives of the people around me.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   That I want to actually draw around them and I want to be used by God to speak into someone's life."
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Because guess what?
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I want someone to speak into my life.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I need someone to come and lay their hands on me and pray for me.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And wouldn't it be amazing if every week at the Vine,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   we just paused to look at our neighbors and kind of take the courage to say,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   "Is there some way I can pray for you?"
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And so what we saw last week, we're believing.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   We're not going to mandate it.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   We're not going to force you to do it.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But I'm just believing as the Spirit of God stirs inside of us,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   you're going to have a hunger to say, "I want more of that."
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And guess what?
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   The power, the Spirit sits in you.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   And what I loved about last week is so many of you were able to do this.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   You were able to take a circumstance and a situation from somebody
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   and connect it to something that God was doing in their life.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And you were able to pray into that connection of a circumstance,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   a situation in the world, and God and His kingdom and the Spirit.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And bringing the world and the kingdom together is exactly what today is all about.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   I want to introduce you to the second of these characters
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   that have literally changed the world and changed how we think about church.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   And again, it's somebody that you're probably not very familiar with.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And like last week, where that story of that individual, Ananias,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   sat within a bigger narrative of a more famous Christian, Paul.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   So today's hero, their story, her story,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   sits within the larger narrative of another famous disciple in the New Testament,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   that of Peter.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   And in this story, we see Peter at a moment of his life
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   that was the most tragic and most difficult.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Peter had some pretty big tragedies and some pretty difficult moments in his life,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   throughout his life.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   He was one of those guys who sometimes had it right and sometimes had it wrong,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   who kind of opened his mouth and put his foot in it
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   and sometimes said great things and sometimes said really weird things.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   That was kind of Peter's journey with Jesus.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Like, "Who are you, Lord?"
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Then it was like, "You're the Son of God."
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Then it was like, "I deny you. I don't know who you are."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Then it's distraught, back fishing.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Then God meets him with a fire on the beach
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   and has breakfast with him in the resurrection.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And then Peter is filled again with forgiveness
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   and he becomes the central rock of the early church.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   He stands before the Sanhedrin and he preaches the gospel.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   He's flogged and he's beaten for it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   But he says, "I'm counted worthy of being persecuted for the gospel."
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And then at this time in the story, he's arrested.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And he's placed in prison.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And he's literally days away from his execution.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I mean, this is about as hard as it gets for Peter.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And the question the passage asks is,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   "Is anyone going to be able to help this man?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Is anyone going to be able to save him?"
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And large doors swing on very small hinges.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I want to introduce you today to another small hinge
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   who's going to blow your mind.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   This story is found in Acts chapter 12.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   It's perhaps my favorite story in the whole of Acts.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And I said exactly that about Acts 9 last week.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   But I'm allowed to change my mind every week, okay?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   This is my favorite story in all of Acts.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   I love this one.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   All right, Acts 12 verse 1. Are you ready?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Okay.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   "It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   intending to persecute them.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   When he saw that this pleased the Jews,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   he proceeded to seize Peter also.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   After arresting him, he put him in prison,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover."
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   So I tell you each week that Luke is a master storyteller.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And each week as I'm preaching out of the Scriptures,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I want to model for you what Bible study is like,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   how you can approach the Scriptures for yourself.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And each week I say that the opening part of a passage
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   is often the most critical to understand the broader narrative
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   that's important for your interpretation of what happens.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And here we see the exact same thing happening.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   So first of all, Luke, the storyteller, he tells us about Herod.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Now this is the different, this is not the same Herod
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   as the Herod that was there at Jesus' birth,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   the one who ordered the genocide of all the children under two
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   in and around Bethlehem.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   This is actually, that's Herod's grandson,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   who's also called Herod, which is a bit confusing,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   but it's his grandson.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And this Herod's interesting because he's Roman,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   but history tells us that he actually had some Jewish ancestry in him.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   So he was part Roman and part Jewish,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and in a way the perfect person to govern Judea at this time.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   But because he was part Jewish, he had a certain tendency
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   to want to please the Jews in the area that he was serving.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And so he had arrested James.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Now this is not James, the brother of Jesus.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   This is James, who's the son of Zebedee, one of the 12.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And this James is arrested by Herod, and Herod puts him to death.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   It literally says here he was killed by the sword.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Now that should make you stop and think,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   because Roman governors, when they wanted to kill someone,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   their execution was on a cross, like what happened with Jesus.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Crucifixion wasn't just for Jesus.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   It was the general way that the Romans kill people.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   But here in the text, this Roman governor doesn't use a crucifixion for James.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   He uses the sword.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Now the reason is, is because in the Jewish law of the first century,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   in the midrash, if somebody was an apostate,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   they were allowed to be killed by stoning or by the sword.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And what Herod does in killing this James by the sword,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   he's sending a message to all of the Jewish people in the area.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   And he's saying, "I agree with you. Christianity is wrong.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   I agree with you. We don't believe Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And anybody who does is an apostate.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   And watch, I kill him with the sword to confirm to you
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   that I agree that Christianity is wrong."
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Now this pleased the Jews, so much so that Herod's on a roll.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   So he's like, "Well, who else can I arrest?"
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   "Well, I'm going to arrest the most famous church leader in that moment.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   That was Peter."
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Now Paul, we saw last week, has already had his conversion experience,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   but Paul's not yet released yet to be a leader in the church,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   into the Greek and Roman Empire.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Peter is the central leader at this time.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And so Herod doubles down. He arrests Peter.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Now it says here that he arrests him during the week
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   of the festival of the unleavened bread.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   This is the same week that Jesus was arrested.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   It's the week of the celebration of the Passover.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   It's the week when they actually celebrated their release by Egypt
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   from slavery by God's power into the promised land.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It's a whole week that is to celebrate that God can liberate his people.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   And the irony of this story is Peter is arrested at the very week
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   when they're celebrating liberation.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Peter is incarcerated during the festival of liberation.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And it's explained that way to help us to begin to kind of go,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "Oh, that doesn't seem right.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   There's something odd going on in this story right here."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And the final thing Luke introduces us to is how Peter is guarded.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   He's not just guarded by one guard outside behind some locked doors.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   He is actually chained by two guards.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   So two guards are literally chained to his ankles.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And then there are two other guards that are outside.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And these four guards rotate all the time so that there is 24-hour surveillance of Peter.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   They do this because they believe that he's a flight risk,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   that he's going to try to escape, which is ironic because that's about to happen, right?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   But in this moment, they're like, "We're not sure if he's going to stick around.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   So we're going to make sure he does by chaining him literally to these guards
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   and setting this all up."
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   So everything is designed in the story right here for you to lean into it and go,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   "What's going to happen next?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Is there any hope at all for Peter?"
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Verse 5 says this,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   "So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him."
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   I love this. Luke says you need to understand that there was hope in this situation.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   That although Peter was in prison, the church was gathered praying for him.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   The church was gathered praying for him, believing that their prayers mattered,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   believing that prayer could change Peter's situation.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Although he might be incarcerated during the festival of liberation,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   but don't give up hope.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   The church is alive. The church is on its knees.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   The church is praying for him.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And there's this exciting sense that the church is doing that.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   You need to know that there's power in a gathered church praying,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   and that's exactly what we're going to do on Tuesday evening at 7.30.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I know, I know. None of you were planning to be there,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   but this is important. 7.30 in this room or online,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   when a church prays, something changes in the atmosphere.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   God does something. He listens to the cries of his people.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   When his church is on its knees pleading, God responds.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Luke describes it as a church earnestly praying for Peter.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   The word "earnestly" there is the exact same word that Luke uses for Jesus
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   when he's praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Remember that moment where Jesus is crying out,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   "Lord, if there's any other way, take the cross from me,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   but your will be done, not my will."
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   And he's so anxious that he's literally sweating blood.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Luke takes that same word and he says,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   "That's what it was like for this church.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   They were gathered on their knees."
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   The word in Greek means to stretch forth.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   They were stretching forth like Jesus was,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   and they were probably praying,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "God, release Peter from prison. Release him from the chains,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   but not our will, but your will be done.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   But if there's any way for him to be released,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   would you bring him back to us? Release him.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   We don't want him to die." They're stretching out.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Here's the other crazy thing.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   The festival of unliving bread lasted for seven days,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and Herod could not do a trial until the whole thing was finished.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   So for seven days, the church is crying out.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Can you see a church of faith crying out,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   believing that they could change the scenario of Peter's life
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   by stretching forth like in the Garden of Gethsemane?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Oh, man, does our city need a few churches like that?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   I wonder whether we might rise up in this time
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   of Hong Kong's great need,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   in this time of such change in our city,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   that we would be willing to get our knees dirty,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   stretch forth, and really pray 7.30 on Tuesday night.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   That's the last time I'm mentioning it, okay?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   But I look forward to seeing everybody there.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Does the prayer make a difference? Let's have a look.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   This whole sermon is not a plug for Tuesday night, I promise.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Verse 6 onwards.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   "The night before Herod was to bring him to trial,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and centuries stood guard at the entrance.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   He struck Peter on the side and woke him up.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   'Quickly, get up,' he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists."
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I love this moment. Oh, my goodness, this is so good.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Can you imagine if you were this angel?
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   This is your moment.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Like you've been an angel all your life.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Like you've always wanted to be used by God
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   for a powerful encounter in the world.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And God has come and tapped you on the shoulder.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Let's call him Angel Bob.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   God's come and tapped him on the shoulder and said,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   'Angel Bob, this is your moment.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   I'm sending you down into a jail cell where Peter is,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   and you're going to show up, and light's going to shine all around,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   and it's going to be this magic moment,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and you're going to release Peter from prison.'
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And you can imagine this angel, 'Wow, this is the best moment of my life.'
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And Luke says, 'Peter's sleeping, like passed out.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Like not just sleeping, sleeping so much that when the angel shows up,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   he has to strike him on his side to wake him up.'
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   This is the night before Peter should have gone to trial.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   The night before he's being sentenced to death,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Peter's just like, 'I don't know about you,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   but I would be pacing around praying or doing something.'
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Put yourself in the--I don't know if angels wore sandals--
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   put yourself in the sandals of this angel for a moment.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Imagine this. He's getting ready, right?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And this is the moment. There's Peter.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   He's like, 'Ahhhh!'
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   You know, like suddenly showing up, right?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Peter's like, 'Ahhhh!'
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   The angel's like, 'Well, that didn't quite go to plan.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   All right, I'm going to turn it up to 11 on the notch here.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   We're going to do this again. Ahhh!'
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   The light flashes around, and he's completely oblivious to it.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   And so the angel goes up to him and said,
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   'Hey, come on, let's go. Hey, you, don't wake the guards.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Come on, you. Yes, you.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Wait, why are you not waking? You're not--'
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And he kicks him in the stomach.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Literally, the Greek word means.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   He strikes him in the stomach.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   You can imagine Peter going like, 'Ooooh!' like this.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Suddenly waking out of his deep sleep and seeing an angel.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   It's described here that he thinks he's seeing a vision.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   He doesn't really know that this is happening in reality,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   but the chains fall off his wrist.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Notice what happens next.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Verse 8 onwards.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   'Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and your sandals."
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And Peter did so.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   And the angel told him.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   So Peter followed him out of the prison,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   but he had no idea what the angel was doing was really happening.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   He thought he was seeing a vision.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   'They passed the first and the second guards
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   and then came to the iron gate leading to the city.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   It opened for them by itself and they went through it.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   When they had walked the length of one street,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   suddenly the angel left him.'
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Don't know how that happened, but the angel just left.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   'Then Peter came to himself in that moment and said,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   and rescued me from Herod's clutches
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating."'
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   The angel leads him past one set of guards,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   past the second set of guards,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   and then they come to this thing called the iron gate.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Now the iron gate was really important.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   This is the main prison in Jerusalem.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   The iron gate was a big, heavy, solid gate
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   that had one purpose in mind.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   That was to keep the people who were in prison, in prison,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   and keep the people who were in the city out of the prison.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   It was the gateway between those that were incarcerated
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   to the freedom that was seen in the city.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   This has significant metaphorical punch to the story, this iron gate.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And this iron gate, as Peter gets to it, opens up by itself,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   miraculously by itself, so that Peter can walk straight through it.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And when he gets one length of a street, the angel disappears
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and he has this 'aha' moment.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   He's like, 'Wow, this really just did happen.'
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And Peter says these incredible words.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   He says, 'I know now that God has sent an angel
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   to deliver me from Herod's clutches.'
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   The word 'clutches' there is a word that's found predominantly
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   in the Exodus narrative, where God releases by the Passover,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Israel to be able to get out from Egypt's slavery.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   It's the word that was used a lot during the festival of unleavened bread.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And Peter makes the connection in his freedom.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   He's like, 'I've experienced liberation.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   I've experienced a new Exodus.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   I am now out of the clutches of Herod, and I am free.'
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   I think for Peter, the opening of the iron gate was his Red Sea parting moment.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   That moment in the Exodus story where the sea parted,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   so they could get through and get away and go to safety.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   So the iron gate opening by itself was like the waters of the Red Sea passing,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and now Peter is free.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And he's standing on the street, and he's like, 'I'm free!'
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   But then something dawns on him.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   He might be out of prison, but he's not yet out of danger.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And he knows that probably at any moment now, the guards are going to wake up.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   The guards are going to work out what's happened.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Any moment now, they're going to start running after him.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And he suddenly starts to panic, and he thinks, 'Well, what do I do?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Where do I go? Where is safe for me? Where do I move to safety?'
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And he decides, 'Oh, there's that church, isn't there, that meets in Mary's house.'
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   He's got no idea that they're meeting, they're praying for him,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   but he decides he's going to go to Mary's house, because that's a safe place.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I want you to see what happens next in the story.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Verse 12, "When this all dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying."
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   This is where our small hinge comes into the story.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she ran back in without opening it,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   and exclaimed, 'Peter's at the door!'"
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Let me tell you a little bit about the small hinge called Rhoda.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   Rhoda is a Greek name.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   We don't know much about her in this story, but her name is Greek.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   It actually in the Greek means rose.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   So perhaps she was a young girl.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Perhaps she was kind of fragile and sort of peaceful like a rose.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   What we do know about her is her profession.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   She's described by Luke here as a servant girl in Mary's house.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Mary was wealthy, had the largest home in Jerusalem, which is why they gathered there.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Scholars believe that the home of Mary was where the Pentecost actually happened,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   where the Holy Spirit had fallen when they were gathered in the upper room.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   That's this very house.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And in the narrative here, this woman is a servant girl of that house.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   In other words, this is a first century domestic worker.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Her duties and her job was to look after the house, was to clean it,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   was to prepare the food for the people that lived there,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   was to host the guests when they came in.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   That was who Rhoda is.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   If you're sitting in this room and you're a domestic worker,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   I hope this really encourages you.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   This is the Bible story where a domestic worker is the hero of the story.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I hope that deeply encourages you.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   If you're a domestic worker in this room, Rhoda is just like you.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   And because she's a servant girl in this house, her very job,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   the nature of that job meant that she had the ability to move
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   between the outer courts of the house and the inner sanctum of the house.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And here's the great thing.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   There's a church that's meeting in the inner sanctum and they're praying.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And what are they praying for?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   They're praying for Peter to be released from prison.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   And they're stretching forth, they're sweating blood,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   they're doing the whole thing, they've been doing it for days.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And because they've been doing it for days,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Rhoda, as a good servant girl, has heard their prayers.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   She knows what they're praying for.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   And in her duties, she's going around and she's on the outer courts
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   and suddenly she hears the door knocking.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   She can hear it knocking because she's not so caught up
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   in the inner sanctum of the religious activity.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   I bet there was so much noise going on there
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   that no one was going to hear the outside door.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Rhoda's in the right position.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   She hears the outside door, she goes towards it,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   and she recognizes Peter's voice.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Well, of course she did.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Because she'd been around that house for ages and Peter had been there
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and Pentecost had happened there.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And she knew Peter and she knew his voice.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   She hears his voice and suddenly she freaks out.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   She's so excited.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   She's so excited because she realizes that what they're praying for
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   in that room has actually happened.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   That it's now standing here at the door.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   See, Rhoda is the one in the story who's able to connect
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   what is happening in the prayer meeting
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   to what is actually happening in the real world.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   It's Rhoda who does that. No one else.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   She's uniquely positioned to be between the two worlds
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   and connect them together.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And she's so excited about it, she's suddenly in a dilemma.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   What do I do? Do I open the door and let him in?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Or do I tell them that he's there? Do I open?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   No, I've got to tell them.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And she runs back into the prayer meeting.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   And she says, "Guys, you can stop praying.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   The answer to the prayer is at the door. Woo-hoo!"
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Everybody that's praying in the prayer meeting are like,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   "Whoa, whoa, just can you quiet down? Please, we're praying here.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   This is really important right now.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   We're praying for something very important.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   We're praying for Peter's release."
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   She's like, "Do you realize that Peter's actually at the door?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   He's at the door."
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And they just keep praying.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And she keeps saying that he's at the door.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   And during that whole time, Peter's still at the door.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   He's still outside, in danger of being arrested again.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   He's not yet in safety.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   And he can't get into the house.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Think about this for a second.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   This is the great irony of this story.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   It was actually much easier for Peter to get out of the doors of a prison
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   than it was for him to get into the doors of a church.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Now that should say something to us.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   That should sober us.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   It should challenge us.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Are we a church that makes entry difficult?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Is it easier for God to liberate people in the world
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   and harder for Him to actually get them to attend church?
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   In our season of evangelism and discipleship here in 2022 at the Vine,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   are we in danger of having closed doors, if you will?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Not physically per se in the building, but specifically in the body of Christ?
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Do we close the doors of our hearts to certain groups of people
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   that we think don't deserve to become Christians?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Do we close our mind to the idea that certain types of people could become Christians?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Do we shut the metaphorical doors of the body of Christ
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   and make it more difficult for people to come and find fellowship and community here
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   than it is for them to find grace in Christ Jesus?
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   And I think if that is the case, we have to ask ourselves some pretty sobering questions.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Have we put any barriers?
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Is there, let me put it this way, an iron gate,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   not just stopping the prison from the city,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   but stopping the city from the church and the church from the city?
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And if so, maybe we need to do something about it.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Rhoda is pleading with the church to be aware that their prayer has answered.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Let me show you what happens next in the story.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   It says this. It says, "You are out of your mind," they told her.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, "Well, it must be his angel then."
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   "You're out of your mind," they're saying. "Would you just quiet down, woman? We're praying here."
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Like, this is important church business. There's lots of church stuff happening here.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   This is religious activity. Just relax, okay?
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   "You're out of your mind. You're stupid. You haven't worked it out. You're just a servant, girl."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "You don't have it all together. You're not a leader here. You haven't discerned it properly."
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   "Leave us alone," is basically what they're saying to her.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   I wonder if any of you in this room have felt that from church leadership at some point in your life.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Whether, if I'm honest, leadership here at the Vine,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   or leadership perhaps in other churches you've attended.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Have you ever felt shut down by leadership?
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Have you ever felt like you're not valuable to them?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Ever felt like you don't have a voice?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   That you're not as spiritual, you don't discern as well?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   That you just stay over there and let us religious people do our religious things?
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   I wonder if you've ever felt that way in your family.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Perhaps some of you in this room are the only Christians in your family.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Have you ever felt ashamed?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Have you ever felt like your family have said, "You're out of your mind that you believe that."
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   I wonder if anyone in here feels like that in the workplace.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Maybe your colleagues know that you're a Christian and they think that's a bit strange and a bit unusual.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   And they say, "Who are you? You're out of your mind."
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   But Rhoda doesn't give up.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And I want you to know that you are not to give up.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   She keeps pleading with the church, "Hey, he's there, he's there."
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   So eventually they go, "Well, it must be his ghost because it can't physically be him."
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   "It can't really be the answer to our prayer. It can't really be that."
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   So maybe Herod killed him early and his angel has shown up at the door, banging on the door.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   That's what they think.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And so they actually go, notice this in the next verse.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   "But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished."
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   "Peter motioned with his hands to them to be quiet and describe how the Lord had brought him out of the prison."
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   "Tell James and the brothers about this."
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   And then he left for another place.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   They finally go with Rhoda to the outer course of the thing.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   They open the door and Peter is there.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And the Bible says they're astonished.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   What are they astonished about?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   They're astonished that the thing that they were praying about has actually come to be.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   They're like, "Whoa, we were praying, but we didn't really think it was going to happen."
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   "We were excited, but we didn't really think it was going to happen."
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   But it's actually happened. They're astonished.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And who is the one who is able to help them to see that the very thing that they were praying for has happened?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   It's not the church leadership.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   It's not the amazingly powerful spiritual people.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   Consider the people that were praying.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   These were most of the 12 were in that room.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   This is James, the brother of Jesus was in that room.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   This was the significant senior leadership of the church.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   None of them actually believed the prayer was going to take place.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   The person who believed, who was positioned to know,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   who had the flexibility to understand what was happening in the house,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   and also see what was happening in the world, was not church leadership.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   It was Rhoda.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And this story teaches us something.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Not only is it a story where a domestic worker is the hero,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   it's also a story where the church, the pastors, are wrong.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   You should clap for that. That's a good thing for you.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   That should excite you.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   The church leadership, the pastors, were wrong.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   They're not the heroes here.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   And this sets up and changes something dramatically for the whole concept of what church is about.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   That it's actually not about the leaders.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   It's not about the pastors.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   They are there to serve you, love you.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I love my job. What a privilege it is to be a pastor.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   But church is not about me. It's not about my team.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   It's about you.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   You're the hero of the church story.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   You're Rhoda.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Because you are the ones whose one foot is in the world and one foot is in church.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   And you can translate between the two of those things.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   You are the ones who are uniquely positioned to take the gospel from here and bring it into the world
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   and take what God is doing in the world and communicate it to us in here.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   My job is to 100% serve you, love you, help you to be the best that you can be,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   teach you, pray for you, love you.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   That's my job.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   My feet are in the church and I'm glad that God's given me that calling.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Your calling though is to be like Rhoda who can move between the two spheres
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   and be able to translate the gospel into the world.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   That's who you are.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And what we learn in this story is something very sobering.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   It's often easier for a miracle to happen than it is for it to be believed.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   The actual miracle of this miracle is the fact that it was believed.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   And why was it believed?
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Because Rhoda changed everything.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Because I want you to see this.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Before this moment, the church was praying earnestly, reaching forth,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   but they didn't really believe that it was going to happen.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   But I tell you what, from this moment forward, the early church was dramatically changed.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   From this moment forward, I bet you everybody who was in that room that day praying
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   and everybody who saw Peter come in that door, freed by the power of Jesus,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   that that faith level of that church completely changed.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I bet you every single time they prayed after that, they actually believed that it was going to happen.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   That at that time, everything changed.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   And who changed it? The church leadership? No.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Rhoda.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   Somebody that history tends to forget completely changed the church.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Completely gave you your story.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   If you're a Christian in this room, and if you haven't been called to be a part of the staff of the church,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   then you're in full-time ministry like Rhoda was.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   With one foot in the camp of the church, one foot in the world,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   and uniquely positioned to do what I could never do.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   Translate between the two of those things and bring a testimony of the power of God in both of them.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And I feel like if God's going to do anything in us in this season,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   in this important hour that we're in in Hong Kong and its history,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   we need to be Ananiases, laying hands on one another,
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   speaking truth to each other, praying for each other,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   believing the best for each other, raising each other up.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   And we need to be Rhodas, planted in our schools, planted in our workplaces,
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   planted in our families, able to say, "I'm proud to be here as well as I'm proud to be in the kingdom."
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   And that there is no distinction between secular and sacred,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   that all of us together are a part of the kingdom of God.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   And my work has as much value and as much power as anything else,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   and I straddled it too, and what a gift it is, because this is what church is all about.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   You're a Rhoda, a servant in God's kingdom.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   May you firmly plant a foot so that you can always open doors
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   for those on the outside to come into church.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   And may you always run into the religious activity
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   and have the courage to speak what's happening in the world to the church.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   And when that takes place, I believe the body of Christ is truly equipped to be what it should be.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   It won't be equipped by me and the other pastors here.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   It will only be equipped as the Rhodas are released.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   Run with that anointing. Plant your feet proudly where you are.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Whatever job it is, whatever career you have, whatever spirit of influence you're planted in,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   you are there for a reason. Embrace it, love it, and see God's glory come out of it.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   For His glory. In Jesus' name.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Everyone says? Amen.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Would you stand with me? I want to pray for you.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Father, I just want to thank you so much for all the Rhodas in this room.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Father, we first of all think of our actual Rhodas, the domestic workers in this room.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Our Filipino brothers and sisters, Indonesian brothers and sisters that we love dearly.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Father, we want to pray for them in this moment.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Father, we ask that you would strengthen them and encourage them.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   So often their job is a thankless task.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   So often they're treated a little bit like how Rhodas are treated in this story.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Father, we just pray for an anointing and a power upon them.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   We pray that they would be deeply encouraged by the hero that is Rhoda today.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   And that would inspire them in all the places that you've planted them,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   the homes of Hong Kong that you have planted them in, Lord.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Many of those homes perhaps don't believe in you.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   We pray that you would use these incredible domestic workers
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   to represent your hands and feet to the people that they are planted within.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   And Father, we pray for all of us.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Each one of us a Rhoda in our own ways.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   School teachers in this room, lawyers, policemen, politicians,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   people in marketing and backgrounds there, media,
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   people in the entertainment world,
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   so many different industries represented of course across our services.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   And Father, each one of them has been called by you to be like Rhoda,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   to be able to connect the world and the church and see them come together,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   to help the church not be a holy huddle that just forgets everything that's happening in the world
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   and likely enables the kingdom of God to be glorified and testified in the world.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   And so Father, I want to pray for a release over these men and women.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   I want to ask that you would fill them with inspiration and passion.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   We thank you for Rhoda's story and how it's so much a part of ours now.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   And Lord, would you forgive us where we do look at some things as sacred and some things as secular,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   where we haven't recognized that this world is yours,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   that in your death and resurrection you brought everything under your feet,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   that Paul would say we get to now pray to the name that is above every name,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   and that Lord Hong Kong is yours, China is yours.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   And Father, we just are so grateful that we have a King and Kings and a Lord of Lords
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   who is in control.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Father, I pray that you'd fill the church of this city with Rhoda's,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   connected to your kingdom, seeing that kingdom in all places.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   And Father, if there's anyone here that feels devalued,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   anyone here who feels like either the church or others have said, "You're out of your mind."
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Lord, would you forgive us?
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Lord, we pray that you would release us to be your hands and feet in every place that you put us.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Amen. Let's worship now together.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   (music)
