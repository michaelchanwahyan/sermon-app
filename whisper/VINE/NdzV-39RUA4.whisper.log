[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   Pastor Ellison, we thank you that you have put him here
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.320]   within our community.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.560]   We thank you for his leadership.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.940]   We thank you for his love for everyone.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.320]   We thank you for him, for his passion to share your love
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.920]   and your word with us.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.880]   So anoint his words now we pray,
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.560]   and I pray for each of us here that we will receive
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.180]   what you have for each of us.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.440]   Amen, over to you.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.600]   - Thank you Jess, and thank you worship team.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.920]   That was amazing, good grief.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.440]   Okay, well, morning everyone.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.200]   If you're joining us online, if you're sitting over,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.320]   good morning to you as well.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.160]   Really glad to be back in the,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.360]   you know, we've had a bit of a renovation,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.240]   sort of like a home edit Vine Church version.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.440]   Thank you, Tim.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.280]   Want to swap mics?
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.220]   Okay, good.
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.320]   All right, so fresh building.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.900]   I hope you guys feel welcomed back.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.060]   And as Jess said, today is Palm Sunday,
[00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.300]   the day where we remember Jesus riding in triumphantly
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.200]   into Jerusalem, crowds worshiping with shouts of hosanna.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.680]   So it's only appropriate that we are welcoming Jesus today
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.880]   in our midst as well.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.720]   And so it really is, each time I get to share,
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.560]   it's a great honor to be able to share.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.160]   And as Jess said, we've been,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.420]   the theme for this year is intimacy.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.080]   And so hopefully today we're gonna dig a little bit deeper
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.160]   into that word.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.320]   We really feel like God's drawing us into intimacy
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.120]   with each other, into a relationship with him,
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.340]   but that should change,
[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.080]   that should affect the way we live our life.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.620]   And this passage there really hope will allow us to do that.
[00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.500]   So if we're ready, let's get to it.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.620]   John chapter 15, nine to 17
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.820]   is what we're gonna be looking at today.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.660]   You could gather with me or just follow up and listen along.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.380]   John 15, nine.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.740]   As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.860]   Now remain in my love.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.680]   If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920]   just as I have kept my Father's commands
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.160]   and remain in his love.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.260]   I have told you this so that my joy may be in you
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.660]   and that your joy may be complete.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.560]   My command is this.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.940]   Love each other as I have loved you.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.740]   Greater love has no one than this,
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.740]   to lay down one's life for one's friend.
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.840]   If you are my friends, you will do what I command.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.220]   I no longer call you servants
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.780]   because a servant does not know his master's business.
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.420]   Instead, I have called you friends
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.760]   for everything that I learned from my Father,
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.020]   I have made known to you.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.020]   You did not choose me, but I chose you
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.660]   and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit,
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.220]   fruit that will last.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.260]   And so whatever you ask in my name,
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.660]   the Father will give to you.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.800]   This is my command.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.700]   Love each other.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.020]   So "Forrest Gump," one of my favorite movies of all time.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.220]   I shared in "Yunlong," I like "Karate Kid,"
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.820]   it was the most nostalgic movie I felt like.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.100]   But "Forrest Gump," one of my favorite movies of all time.
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.340]   I just love the story, right?
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.100]   A very simple man who went on to do great things.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.140]   An all-American football champion, war hero,
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.020]   international ping pong star,
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.300]   multimillionaire, right?
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.700]   The list is endless.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.460]   He did so many amazing things.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.020]   But despite all his achievements,
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.080]   the one thing he couldn't get right was his love life
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.260]   and his relationship with his childhood sweetheart, Jenny.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.720]   Right, on and off, he keeps on showing love to Jenny
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.420]   and she keeps running away.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420]   And the whole story is based upon
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.140]   his relationship with Jenny.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.460]   And there's one particular scene.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.020]   Jenny has come back after running away again for a while
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.100]   and she's come back and she's been living in his house
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.860]   and they've been having a really good time together.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.020]   It's really sweet.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.500]   They get to reconnect in lots of sweet, different ways.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.220]   And so, he feels like, okay, maybe this is going somewhere.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.560]   And so he decides to propose to Jenny
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.720]   so that she will stay this time and let him take care of her.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.500]   But then Jenny rejects the proposal.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.900]   And so Forrest is, of course, very heartbroken, right?
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.880]   He doesn't understand.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.960]   Why won't she just stay?
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.260]   Why won't this woman that I love so much
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.160]   just stay and let me look after her?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.580]   And he says this famous line, okay?
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.260]   I'm gonna give you my best Forrest Gump impression.
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.100]   Are you ready?
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.940]   Okay.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.980]   (clears throat)
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.580]   Why don't you love me, Jenny?
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.220]   I'm not a smart man, but I love you.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.140]   All right?
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.020]   You remember watching that scene?
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.100]   Like tears pouring down my eyes, right?
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.420]   Crying, crying, crying, all right?
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.020]   You felt the pain, right?
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.460]   The effort this man had put into loving this woman
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.820]   only to be faced with rejection.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.980]   But I also remember thinking this
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.900]   when I was watching this.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.380]   Actually, he is a smart guy, actually.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.380]   You know why?
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.380]   Because Forrest Gump says he's figured out what love is.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.980]   So he must be a really smart guy,
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.980]   because love is actually a really confusing thing.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.860]   Right, we say we love pizza,
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.580]   and we say we love our moms, right?
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.540]   You don't love pizza the same way you love your mom.
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.940]   That'd be really weird.
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.320]   So what are we talking about when we use the word love?
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.460]   It's hard to define.
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.820]   I've always been confused about what this word means.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.660]   I think I was most confused
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.300]   just before I got married, I think,
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.980]   was when I was most confused about what the word love was,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.780]   which is inconvenient, right, to say the least.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.660]   'Cause that was when I was finding out, you know,
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.060]   there's, in our premarital stuff, right,
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.780]   there's five love languages, right?
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.020]   First time I heard about five love languages.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.980]   Let me remind you, you probably all familiar, right?
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.780]   Physical touch, words of affirmation,
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.820]   gifts, acts of service, and quality time, right?
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.340]   So the basic idea is, you know,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.380]   each one of us receives and presents love
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.460]   in different ways, right?
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.940]   It's how we show and receive love.
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.820]   But this was really weird for me, right?
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.180]   Maybe a lot of you guys can relate.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.180]   I know you might have heard this before, right?
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.540]   I had no idea there was five love languages.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.260]   And maybe I wasn't the easiest kid growing up, right?
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.140]   But the language used at my home
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.540]   was threats of beating, right?
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.380]   You wanna do this?
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.180]   Okay, stop doing that, okay?
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.780]   That was the language I was used to when I was growing up.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.220]   So I had no idea there was different languages.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.500]   And when I got married, I thought,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.940]   well, my wife is going to massage me
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.260]   while I eat my favorite meal,
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.100]   watching the TV that she bought for me
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.860]   because I'm such an amazing husband, right?
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.980]   That was, we love to eat, amen.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.820]   Did someone amen that?
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.580]   Do not amen that, okay?
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.340]   No, no, okay?
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.620]   What does love really mean?
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.700]   Right, it's a question countless songs, movies, poems,
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.580]   reality TV shows have tried to answer,
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.260]   but we still can't seem to figure it out.
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.180]   So in this season of intimacy,
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.180]   it's important we get a good understanding
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.900]   of what the word love is,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.740]   especially because in church we love to say,
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.420]   oh, Jesus loves you.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.100]   Oh, God loves you so much.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.060]   But what does that mean?
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.180]   How does it affect us?
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.100]   And how does it affect the way we treat each other?
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.700]   And so this passage we just read gives us an explanation
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.100]   of what we're talking about.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.020]   Jesus loves us and how it should make a difference
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.620]   in how we treat each other.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.180]   And I might not be a smart guy either,
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.020]   but hopefully by the end,
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.100]   we'll be able to see what we mean.
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.300]   So let's go back to the passage and see what it has to say.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.700]   And just give us a second.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.940]   Timothy to the rescue.
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.380]   This is a brand new sound system,
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.420]   which is why we're having some teething issues,
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.660]   but hopefully.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.660]   Check, check, check.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.780]   No, okay, hang on.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.300]   Back to this one.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.380]   We'll be okay, right?
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.220]   Are we okay?
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.060]   We're good, okay.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.300]   Let's just keep going, okay?
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.860]   If you need Tim, just come back anytime, all right?
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.220]   [audience laughing]
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.780]   Verse nine says this.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.420]   As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.860]   Now remain in my love.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.420]   If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.260]   just as I have kept my Father's commands
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.580]   and remain in his love.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.220]   In the lead up to Good Friday and the lead up to Easter,
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.380]   this passage actually records some of the last words
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.900]   Jesus spoke to his disciples.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.020]   Before he went to the cross,
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.940]   he wants to make sure they understand who he is
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.100]   and why he came to this earth.
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.540]   He wants to remind them also of who they are
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.500]   and reassure them of how he feels about them.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.820]   And the number one thing he wants to reassure them of
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.940]   is his love for them.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.220]   He wants them to understand what this love is.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.460]   See, when it comes to love, Jesus is never confused.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.380]   Jesus was always confidently talking about love.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.620]   And Jesus was always confidently showing love to people.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.900]   If you read the Gospels, he was always ready to love.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.340]   During his time on earth, Jesus loved people.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.380]   And the way he loved was radically different from the norm.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.460]   This is why the religious leaders didn't like him very much
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.660]   because he loved people that others had deemed
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.260]   unworthy of love.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.260]   But I was thinking about this,
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.300]   like who taught Jesus to be this way?
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.700]   Of course he's the son of God, right?
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.780]   But who taught him to be this way?
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.900]   Was reaching out to the poor and oppressed,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.980]   maybe growing up with Mary and Joseph,
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.140]   something that they taught him, that they instilled in him?
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.580]   Did he grow up with his parents,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.140]   going on family mission trips and stuff like that?
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.980]   With his brothers and sisters, reaching out to people?
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.020]   Did they spend time in the Old Testament
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.580]   reading about stories about how God redeemed
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.180]   all people into his name?
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.660]   We don't really know about Jesus' childhood.
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.540]   But it tells us very clearly why Jesus is so confident
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.940]   he knows what love is.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.140]   He knows what love is because he has felt
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.780]   and experienced it firsthand.
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.060]   From the source of love itself in the most purest form.
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.000]   Jesus knows he learned how to love
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.060]   because he has been loved by the Father.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.820]   And this love that Jesus talks about
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.340]   has a very clear definition, right?
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.740]   There's no confusion.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.060]   The word that the Bible translators use for love,
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.220]   the word that Jesus used for love, okay,
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.180]   is the word agape.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.420]   You see, agape is the word that the Bible writers
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.540]   chose to represent what Jesus was talking about.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.200]   But this agape love is more than just a feeling.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.720]   Agape love is what Jesus meant when he said,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.280]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.880]   "with all your mind, and with all your strength."
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.000]   Agape love is the kind of love that Jesus was constantly
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.400]   demonstrating to his disciples.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.000]   It was the kind of love that moved him into action,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.320]   healing, embracing, teaching those that no one else would.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.020]   It was the kind of love to say crazy things like,
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.960]   "Love your enemy, pray for those who persecute you."
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.760]   And it was the kind of love that eventually led him
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.260]   to the cross to die for humanity.
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.360]   In other words, if we wanna know what love is,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.980]   if we wanna know the definition of love,
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.440]   the answer is found when we look at Jesus.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.640]   And so when Jesus tells his disciples,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.680]   "So I have loved you," it's not a joke.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.440]   He's not pizza, right?
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.840]   It's not something that he's just saying,
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.360]   coming to the end of his life,
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.040]   and he's getting all sentimental and things like that.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.680]   Jesus loves you.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.920]   And he has done everything possible to show us
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.400]   how much he loves you.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.080]   That's our starting point for today.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.120]   And even though it might sound cliche to say this
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.340]   on a Sunday service, we have to remind ourselves of this,
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.980]   because the truth never goes out of style.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.180]   So let me ask you again, church,
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:59.260]   do you know that Jesus loves you?
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.060]   Do you know that he loves you so, so much?
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.020]   I hope the answer is yes.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.200]   'Cause if the answer is yes,
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.420]   there's a way for you to respond to that love.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:18.120]   And Jesus says this, "If you know that I love you,
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.200]   "remain in my love."
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.020]   Okay, wow, that sounds pretty good.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.380]   In fact, it sounds great.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.660]   Do you mean all I have to do is stay in one place?
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.540]   I don't have to do anything, just remain in this place,
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.160]   and I get loved on all day, right?
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.060]   Like a baby being snuggled by his mama.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.100]   Who doesn't want that kind of love?
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.860]   But remember this, right?
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.860]   Agape is more than just a feeling.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.580]   Agape is love in action.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.660]   Which is why Jesus follows up by saying,
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.560]   "If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.900]   "just as I have kept my father's commands,
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.100]   "and remain in his love."
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.660]   Okay, now, hold on a minute.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.320]   Now it's beginning to sound a bit more like
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.140]   what we bargained for, right?
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.300]   Because at first it sounded like
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.060]   we just have to stay in one place, soak up all the love.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.320]   But now it seems like you're telling me
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.780]   that I have to work for it.
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.000]   And besides, don't we always say
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.620]   that Jesus' love is unconditional?
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.320]   So what does he mean by he says, "Remain in my love"?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.160]   Maybe we can explain it this way.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.020]   Yes, it's true.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.240]   God does love you no matter what.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.580]   His love for you is unconditional.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:39.300]   Nothing you can do will ever change Jesus' love for you.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.640]   But the point is not his love for us.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.360]   The point is whether or not you will choose
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.180]   to remain in his love.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.940]   That's the key word, right, remain.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.360]   The word remain is actually written in an active sense,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.680]   okay, an active tense, which is something,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.660]   that means it's happening at the same time.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.340]   This means we have to make a choice.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.220]   We can choose whether or not we want to remain
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.800]   in Jesus' love.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.340]   Loving Jesus has to be a conscious choice you make.
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.500]   Because if it wasn't, it wouldn't be true love.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.460]   If it wasn't, it wouldn't be true intimacy.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.200]   And so what Jesus is teaching us is if we want to remain,
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.440]   like stay in the place of love, then yes,
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.440]   there are conditions to that.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:35.000]   To remain in Jesus' love means we must keep his commandment.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.180]   But understand this, church, right,
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.260]   this isn't some kind of manipulation
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.120]   that Jesus is trying to control us with.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.240]   If we think about healthy relationships,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.060]   actually all healthy relationships have a sense
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.160]   of boundaries, rules, commands that we have to follow.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.360]   Think about a marriage or a friendship
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.200]   or a relationship of some kind.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.300]   Even if you're not married, you can probably understand
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.480]   that within marriage, right, there are certain rules,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.360]   there are certain commands that we have to obey.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.840]   And if you want to stay in a healthy, loving relationship
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.300]   with your spouse or your partner,
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.000]   then within that relationship, right,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.040]   you cannot have that relationship with anyone else.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.840]   If you want your marriage to thrive,
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.760]   to be all it was meant to be,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.700]   then you have to remain in the commands of your marriage,
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.600]   right, to make it a safe place, to show love and honor
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.140]   and respect to each other.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.800]   Within this relationship, there should be healthy boundaries,
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.180]   rules, and commandments that both partners have to follow.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.200]   Otherwise, trust is broken
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.000]   and there wouldn't be any kind of relationship
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.040]   in the first place.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.740]   And so it is in our relationship with Jesus.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.200]   Like I said, he's already done everything he can
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.120]   to show you how much he loves you.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.080]   But if we want that thriving, healthy relationship with him,
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.160]   then we have to keep his commands.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.880]   Now, I think the uncomfortable place,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.900]   at least for me when I was reading this here, right,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.920]   the trigger word also is command.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.500]   Because when we think of command,
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.440]   to me, two things come to mind, right?
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.040]   First, it sounds a bit like, you know, you're programmed,
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.800]   right, I'm old enough to remember
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.240]   when I had that first MS-Docs computer at home.
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.600]   Did you guys remember that?
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.000]   With the black screen, you had to actually type in
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.840]   a D-I-R slash W, whatever it was, right,
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.800]   and a whole bunch of text would come out on the screen,
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.920]   get the floppy, actual floppy disk
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.280]   that you've like put into the computer, right?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.280]   But you put in a command into the computer,
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.760]   like you're coding these days,
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.940]   and then it comes out with a result.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.540]   So it sounds a bit like maybe that Jesus
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.880]   is just forcing us to do it.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.960]   We have no choice, he's programmed us this way,
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.040]   so we respond in a certain way.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.860]   But on the other hand, also, command sounds a bit like
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.400]   something that an evil or an abusive person,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.360]   something like they're trying to force you to do, right?
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.760]   Because kind people don't command.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.720]   Kind people use their words and ask nicely, right?
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.760]   Command is what your 3-year-old tells you
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   in the middle of the night when he says,
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.520]   "I'm thirsty, bring me water."
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.960]   Okay, that sounds more like a command to me, right?
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.200]   We don't have a choice, we're just forced to do it,
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.280]   otherwise you'll be punished, right?
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.580]   So is that what Jesus is saying?
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.920]   No.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.640]   Jesus's commands are not like this.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.740]   He's not trying to program you into intimacy with him,
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.800]   nor is he using his commands to be evil or abusive,
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   because remember the source of where Jesus's commands
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.400]   are coming from.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.440]   It's from a place of love.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.960]   Jesus loves us, he commands us based upon the love
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.720]   that he has received from the Father.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.000]   And so whatever he tells us to do,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.400]   it's always gonna be from a place of love.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.080]   And because of this, we can trust, we should trust,
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.380]   that following what Jesus has called us to do
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.280]   is the best way to live our lives.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.680]   In fact, I would go even further and say this.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.480]   Obeying Jesus is what you were created for.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.060]   Because, check this out,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.520]   the outcome of obeying Jesus's commands,
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.960]   the outcome of remaining in his love,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.160]   it's not something that feels you abused,
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.120]   manipulated, resentful, right?
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.800]   Jesus doesn't force you like a robot,
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   but the outcome of following Jesus's command is joy.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.400]   I have told you this, he says,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.920]   so that my joy may be in you
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.260]   and that your joy may be complete.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.120]   If you want to live a life that's full of meaning,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.600]   if you want to know what true joy is,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.200]   then follow his commands.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.520]   And the reason why following Jesus's commands
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.720]   bring us so much joy is because, like I said,
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.560]   this is, I believe, how we,
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.640]   this is what God made us for.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.600]   This is what Jesus created us for.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   The best way to live, I'll say it again,
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.920]   is to obey Jesus's commands so that our joy be full.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.980]   Notice this, though, church, it says joy.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.240]   Doesn't say happiness, doesn't say excitement,
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.460]   doesn't mean the most luxurious, most comfortable life,
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.520]   but joy, and joy is different from those things.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.120]   You see, when we hear the phrase joy might be complete,
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.840]   it sounds a bit like the most comfortable life
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.520]   you can imagine, maybe, right?
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.120]   So, complete life of joy means no worries, no cares,
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.160]   chilling on a beach with a cold beer,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.360]   in a library with a book, whatever your,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.800]   you know, your picture of serenity is.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.160]   It sounds like it's saying that, but that isn't it.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.920]   Complete joys come, complete joy comes when we live
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.560]   how we are called to live, obeying Jesus.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.280]   And when that's the case,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.920]   then there's all kinds of possibilities.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.680]   And yes, there might be some really good, of course,
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.360]   but it will almost most definitely include
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.120]   walking through some dark and hard and rough places.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.440]   It will most definitely include being rejected by the world.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.480]   In fact, a bit later on, Jesus goes to say,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.200]   "Don't be surprised if the world hates you
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.440]   "because it's hated me."
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.280]   It will most definitely include making an effort
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.840]   to fight back against the darkness and the evil
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.520]   and the sicknesses of this world.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.960]   The point is that our joy is not based upon situation
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.760]   or circumstances or anything on this earth.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.280]   Our joy is based on the fact that we are doing
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.880]   what we were created to do, which is obeying Jesus.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.160]   And if you wanna experience true joy,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.320]   that will never come until we learn what it means
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.320]   to follow Jesus' command, to live as he has called us to live.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.880]   Now, luckily for us, he doesn't leave us in the dark.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.640]   He tells us exactly what the expectations are.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.240]   Jesus says this, "My command is,
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.280]   "love each other as I have loved you."
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:12.160]   Intimacy with God will always result
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.680]   in intimacy with each other.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.920]   To remain in Jesus' love, to keep his commandments,
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.160]   the next logical step is that we will love each other.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.980]   See, it all links together.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.760]   Jesus knows what love is because he has felt it
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.040]   from the Father, he's experienced it from the Father.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.480]   We know what love is because we have experienced it
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.000]   from Jesus.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Now, our task is to go and love others with that same love.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.760]   To love Jesus is to love each other.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.600]   And the way Jesus has called us to love each other
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.360]   is through friendship.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.860]   We are friends of each other.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.280]   We are brothers and sisters of each other.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.160]   We have been called to be friends with each other.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.920]   But this isn't a friendship as the world might define it.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.840]   This isn't friendship that's just based upon
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.440]   getting together with some people with similar interests,
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.940]   that surface-level relationship we might be used to.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.300]   If this was a way to measure true friendship,
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.000]   then I'm friends with the whole of Hong Kong.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.120]   You could literally sit me any time, anywhere,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.940]   I will talk to anybody, okay?
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.000]   I love talking to people.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.600]   Okay, but it's a deeper connection than that.
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.500]   It means more than that.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.520]   The definition that Jesus gives for friendship
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.220]   is far greater.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.520]   Jesus says this, he defines just how deep and fierce
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.520]   this friendship that he expects for us to have each other is.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.760]   Greater love, he says, has no one than this,
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.500]   to lay down one's life for one's friends.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.680]   So, just to be clear, Jesus is saying that your friends
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.240]   are the people that you're willing to die for.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.820]   In that case, our list just got pretty small, right?
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.800]   Nathan DeLista, Andrew Gardiner,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.340]   Promise Armstrong, okay?
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.180]   I don't think there's many people
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.520]   I would be willing to do this for.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.980]   So that Jesus really expect us
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.300]   to uphold something so extreme,
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.540]   but it shouldn't surprise us that Jesus said this,
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.940]   actually, like I said, these are his last words
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.460]   to his disciples and his friends.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.620]   He is literally hours away from laying down his life
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.460]   for their sake.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.420]   He's hours away from demonstrating
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.620]   the most radical, extravagant form of love,
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.500]   dying on the cross for his friends.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.600]   So yes, on one hand, I do think this is something
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.140]   that Jesus really expects from his followers.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.660]   If we are really to love each other as Jesus has loved us,
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.300]   if we mean what we say that we're gonna be Jesus
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.060]   to each other, then that means that we love each other
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.340]   enough to literally give up our lives.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.780]   The greatest way, Jesus says, to show love for each other
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.140]   is to lay your life down for your friends.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:00.500]   However, and I would even say, thankfully for us,
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.020]   here at the Vine Church today,
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.060]   in the church in Hong Kong, in our current context,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.540]   hopefully, none of us will ever be able to ask
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.880]   to do something drastic.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.460]   I hope we're never placed with that horrendous choice
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.780]   of being forced to give up our lives
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.920]   and die on behalf of someone else.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.540]   But just because it doesn't have to go
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.820]   to that extreme right now,
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.780]   we still can apply this to our lives.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.620]   So what does that mean?
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.540]   In the everyday way we live our lives,
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.000]   what does it mean to lay your life down for one's friends?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.940]   The art behind laying your life down for your friends
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.260]   for the sake of others is more about having
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.040]   a self-sacrificing nature.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.100]   Laying your life down for your friends in this light
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.080]   means that you're willing, perhaps sometimes,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.900]   to deny yourself so that others can have.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.300]   Laying your life down for your friends
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.520]   means that you think of others before you think of yourself.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.940]   Laying your life down for your friends
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.640]   means that you sacrifice so that others
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.720]   might have what they need.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.040]   It's about an attitude, it's about a perspective change
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.700]   on how you live your life.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.100]   It's about saying, I'm willing to give up my own rights,
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.140]   to give up my own comfort zone,
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:15.640]   to be stretched in my generosity so that others can be free.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.980]   Let me give us some Hong Kong examples.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.320]   Perhaps on a very, this is just like
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.120]   basic basement level entry, right?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.860]   Laying your life down at your friends is,
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.740]   maybe it's not pretending to be asleep or distracted
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.780]   when you're sitting on the bus on the MTR
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.460]   and someone more in need of a seat walks on.
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.820]   Oh, this is a very Hong Kong problem, right?
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.940]   We, a lot of us have selected blindness
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.300]   when it comes to this church, right?
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.700]   We sit there on the seat and then,
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.660]   oh, hopefully no one in this room does that,
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.540]   but other people we see, right?
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   Someone in need gets onto the bus
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.700]   and they just pretend like, suddenly they're sleepy
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.540]   and they fall asleep.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.420]   Suddenly they can't get off their phone, okay?
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.800]   Give up your seat, you see someone in need.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.620]   Sacrifice a little something for the sake of your friends.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.820]   Or maybe you can even take it a step further
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.680]   and be proactive and act out injustice
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.620]   and be like, excuse me, don't you have a scene?
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.980]   There's a paw paw standing right here.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.180]   Would you like to get up your seat
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.920]   so she can have a seat, right?
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.540]   It might be a bit scary to do that,
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.040]   but that's one way we show our friendship to each other.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.580]   Being friends to each other might be participating
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.260]   in some of the neighborhood conversations
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.140]   that we've been having as a church.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.540]   Reaching out to the community in Wan Chai,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.220]   telling, getting to know them,
[00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.540]   asking them what their needs are
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.180]   and seeing if we can meet them in some practical way.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.380]   Maybe it means volunteering some of your time
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.060]   to serve those who are most vulnerable.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.340]   Maybe you could consider to be a foster family
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.740]   to care for children who are in need.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.200]   Join our Arise community, join our volunteer team.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.380]   Maybe laying your life down for your friends
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.940]   means refusing to let the busyness of the office
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.140]   dictate how you live your life.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.940]   But set up healthy boundaries
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.020]   so you can set aside time for your family
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.380]   and your friends and the people that you love.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.920]   Are we willing to live like this church?
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.800]   To live in a self-sacrificial way
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.960]   so we're not just living for ourselves,
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.040]   we're living to show Jesus' love for other people.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.820]   It's counter-cultural.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.960]   It flies in the face of a city like Hong Kong
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.760]   that says gain as much as you can,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.840]   do as much as you can for yourself.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.080]   Do whatever it takes for yourself to succeed.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.800]   But if you really want to remain in Jesus' love,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.740]   if you want Jesus to be your friend,
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.840]   if you want intimacy with Him,
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.480]   then this is the way we've been called to live.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.160]   Jesus is saying the way I define love and intimacy
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.040]   is that you are willing to obey my commands.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.720]   And my command is that you're willing
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.440]   to live sacrificially for each other.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.440]   Those who do not are not my friends,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.080]   nor are they friends of each other.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.000]   Verse 14 makes it very clear.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   You are my friend if you do what I command.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.720]   Now again, it sounds very one way right now.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.200]   You know, just follow Jesus,
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.680]   just follow Jesus, follow Jesus.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.240]   Well yes, that's part of it.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.220]   But there's also great benefits that come with this too.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.860]   When we are in that deep intimate friendship with Jesus,
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.880]   when we are being His love to others around us,
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.840]   it also results in honor.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.680]   And benefits, listen to what Jesus says.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.160]   I no longer call you my servants,
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.040]   because a servant does not know his master's business.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.200]   Instead, I have called you friends.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.960]   For everything I've learned from my Father,
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.240]   I have made known to you.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.440]   This is beautiful.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.480]   Right, if we were just workers and servants of Jesus,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.640]   He wouldn't owe us any kind of apology.
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.960]   Yes, He would just simply command us to do things,
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.000]   and we would just simply follow.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.960]   But this is a relationship.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.400]   When you enter into that friendship with Jesus,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.880]   He speaks to you, He talks to you,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.680]   He guides you, explains to you,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.600]   He tells you what it means to follow Him.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.000]   He wants to reveal things to you,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.200]   to help you to understand why He's called you to live
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.560]   in the way that He's called you to live.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.320]   And this should blow our minds,
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.660]   because Jesus chose you to be His friend.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.760]   You did not choose me, but I choose you,
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.920]   and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.960]   fruit that will last.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.600]   Think back to your school days.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.280]   Was there ever a time where, you know,
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.960]   or maybe you are the popular person,
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.000]   congratulations to you if you are, okay,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   but if not, did you ever think, you know,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.240]   that really popular person
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.800]   that you wanted to be friends with, right,
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.880]   you just wanted that person to choose you
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.520]   to be your friend so much.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.320]   Or maybe you were in PE, right,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.000]   and that dreaded moment where you split off into two teams,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.080]   and there's two captains,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.840]   and they slowly pick one person in each team,
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   and the team gets dwindled down until, you know,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.600]   if you're me, I always pick last,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.640]   'cause we're playing basketball,
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.880]   and no one wants the short guy on their team, right?
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.080]   And so I was never actually picked, I felt like.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.240]   They just ended up with me, okay?
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   Like, they were stuck with Ellison, okay?
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.960]   Oh, don't cry for me, it's okay.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:23.160]   But that's not how God chooses people, right?
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.880]   This isn't some kind of schoolyard,
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.600]   childish popularity contest.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.920]   Jesus has chosen you,
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.880]   despite of your insecurities,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.140]   despite of your lack of ability.
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.700]   Jesus has chosen you.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.920]   In fact, throughout the Bible, throughout Scripture,
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.640]   Jesus always chooses the kind of people
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.820]   that no one else would choose.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.040]   God chose Abraham, a pagan, to become a great nation
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.840]   that he would bless other nations out of.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.200]   God chose Moses, a coward, to go in front of Pharaoh,
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.440]   the most powerful human being on the earth at that time,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.240]   to bring freedom to the Israelites.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   God chose David, a shepherd boy,
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.840]   to become one of the greatest kings
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.760]   that Israel had ever seen.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.540]   And God chose the prophets.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.660]   If you read through the prophets,
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.920]   all of them were messed up.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.680]   So many issues, but yet he chose them
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.320]   to proclaim God's word, to bring warning,
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.580]   correction, healing, and hope to the nations.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.960]   And so it shouldn't be surprising, right?
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.300]   Even when we look at Jesus' disciples,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.280]   they weren't the sharpest tools in the shed either.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.480]   Peter, who was always hot-headed, abrasive.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.760]   Thomas, who doubted Jesus.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.640]   Judas, who even betrayed him for some coins.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.440]   But all of his disciples, excluding Judas,
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.840]   went on to establish the church,
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.720]   to continue the work that Jesus had called them to do.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.960]   They went on to bear fruit,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.000]   fruit that has lasted to this day.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.080]   Because of what Jesus' disciples did,
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.840]   because they remained in his love,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.680]   because they followed his commands
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.760]   and were obedient to him,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.880]   because they chose to love each other,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.460]   we have the church today.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:08.540]   Listen to me, church.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.040]   This is what I'm trying to say.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:15.920]   Today, now, Jesus continues to choose people
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.040]   to be his friends.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:23.040]   And we have all been chosen to be friends of Jesus.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.720]   Not because of your ability,
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.560]   not because of who you are.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   We are not chosen based on some kind of privilege.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.240]   We have been chosen because he has chosen you
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.400]   for a purpose.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.640]   We have to cherish this church.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.800]   You have been chosen by Jesus for a purpose.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.360]   And that purpose is to bear fruit.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.380]   You have been chosen by Jesus to bear fruit.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.700]   And if Jesus has chosen you as a friend,
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.280]   there is no way your life can be insignificant or pointless.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.320]   He has something for you.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.600]   Your purpose is to bear fruit.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.440]   That's your calling.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.520]   And again, the amazing thing is that can happen
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.580]   in so many different ways.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.640]   The gifts, the talents, the things that God has given to you,
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.120]   the ways that Jesus has created you,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.180]   you have been chosen to do those things
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.880]   so that you will go and bear fruit.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.200]   Fruit that will last.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.800]   That might mean faithfully praying for somebody,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   sharing the gospel with somebody.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.240]   It might mean refusing to give up on someone else,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.680]   that's everyone else has given up on.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.720]   It might mean visiting and connecting with people
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.320]   that other people have forgotten about.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.340]   Opening a home, whatever that is.
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:44.360]   The point is that connection and intimacy
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:49.360]   with Jesus always bears fruit in the way we love each other.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.200]   Whether this is in terms of a single life changed
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.900]   because we have loved somebody as Jesus has loved us,
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.400]   in terms of a single tough decision that you had to make,
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.920]   a single task which you had to perform,
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.660]   and at that time you might not have seen
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.060]   the significance of it,
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.480]   but you know that the world is a better place
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:15.180]   because you chose to remain in Jesus' love,
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.640]   obey Him, and love others in the same way.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.400]   This is the fruit that will last,
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.560]   not just in this age,
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.180]   but have an eternal impact on this world.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:32.880]   This is what we're called to, church.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.520]   And so these should become like the prayers of our heart.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.120]   Finally, Jesus says this,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.240]   if you do this, whatever you ask in my name,
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.620]   the Father will give to you.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.880]   Whatever you ask in my name,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.540]   the Father will give to you.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.960]   The point here is not that Jesus is some sort of
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.240]   thought machine that if we just have enough faith,
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.120]   then we pull the lever and the prizes
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.360]   of answered prayers will come out.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.480]   That's not what Jesus is saying.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.520]   But what Jesus is saying,
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.720]   because you've been so connected to me,
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.960]   because we've been walking intimately
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.320]   with love in each other,
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.120]   because you've remained in my love,
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.800]   and because you've now stepped out in faith
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.520]   and chose to love others in the same way,
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.560]   we have the same heart.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.460]   The things that break God's heart breaks your heart.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.560]   We're praying for the right things.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.680]   We wanna see the same things that Jesus wants to see happen.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.080]   And so when we're doing these things,
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.960]   we have to realize that this is what God wants.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.920]   And so our prayers will be answered
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.540]   because we are following in His commandments.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.000]   So when you do these things,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.120]   maybe some questions to consider.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.640]   Are we praying for the right things?
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.280]   When we talk to Jesus, have we asked Him,
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.000]   what do you want me to pray for, Lord?
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.400]   How can I pray for this situation?
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.540]   Do we have the mind of Christ when it comes to prayer?
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.720]   Are the things that break Jesus' heart
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.660]   the same things that break our heart?
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.640]   And when we're answering these questions,
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.840]   when we're living in His love,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.680]   when we're following Him in intimacy,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.540]   our prayers are answered
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.400]   because we're working in connection
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.720]   and the power of who Jesus is.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:15.480]   It's all about yielding your heart to Him,
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.640]   allowing Him to work through you at all times,
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.000]   for Him to take control of what you say,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.200]   what you think, and what you do,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.920]   to remain in His love.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.120]   And when we do this, you will see your prayers answered.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.280]   You will see Jesus move and work in this world.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.820]   So it's simple, but it's challenging.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.700]   And Jesus wasn't joking when He said,
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.320]   all the laws of the prophets hang on this.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.580]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.080]   mind, and strength.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.500]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:59.100]   As a community, friends, I pray,
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.940]   our prayer is that we would all remain in Jesus' love,
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.080]   to be obedient to His commandments,
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:12.080]   so that we can change a world that needs it so badly.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.200]   Remain in His love, reach out to others in that same love,
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   so that we can bear fruit,
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.380]   fruit that will never lose its purpose,
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.820]   fruit that will last from now until all eternity.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.440]   I wonder if you pray with me, church.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.100]   (audience member coughing)
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:45.240]   Perhaps for some of us, like I said earlier in this room,
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:50.200]   that just the first step of remaining in Jesus' love
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.640]   has been a big challenge.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.160]   And maybe you found yourself, you know,
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.120]   oh yeah, I had that one time,
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.960]   or I've never really understood what it was.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.640]   And so it seems scary and seems foreign,
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.480]   and you ran away from it, or you've stayed away from it.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:16.120]   And the first step, like Jess was saying just now,
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.460]   is just to take that step toward Jesus.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.560]   He has already chosen you.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.400]   He has already loved you.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.760]   You don't have to be worried if you approach Him,
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.440]   He's gonna reject you or say no, or say,
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.460]   ah, not for me, not on my team.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.880]   But Jesus has a purpose for you.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.880]   He created you to follow what He wants for you to do.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.920]   And there is so much fruit
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.400]   that you're gonna see in your life
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.840]   if you choose to remain in Jesus' love
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.040]   and be obedient to Him.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.680]   So if you found yourself feeling lost and restless
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.160]   and joyless and meaningless with your life,
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.860]   come back into His love and stay in that place.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:07.360]   And as we stay in that place, Jesus, I pray that
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.320]   you would help us see the joy in following your commands.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.960]   Even through the toughest of times,
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.640]   even when it seems like it doesn't make sense to claim joy,
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.240]   Jesus, I pray that we would remain in your love,
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.700]   that we would never stray away from it.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.120]   And as we do that, Lord,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   help us to love others in the same way.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.840]   Help us to be friends to each other.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.120]   Help us to be friends in a world
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.400]   that so desperately needs friendship and community and love,
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.820]   that is so lost and so hungering for this.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.160]   And as we do that, Lord, we bear fruit.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.120]   Lives are changed.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.320]   People are brought from a place of hopelessness to hope,
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.360]   of death into life, of darkness into light,
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   of sorrow into joy, because we have been obedient to you,
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.200]   because we have been friends of you
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.640]   and friends to each other.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.320]   So Jesus, continue to walk with us.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.160]   Thank you for being our friend.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.680]   May we be your friends in return
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.400]   and be friends to those around us.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.320]   In your name we pray.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:33.840]   - Church, let's all stand as we respond in worship.
