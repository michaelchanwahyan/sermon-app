1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
 - Thank you, Carla.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,300
 Congratulations to all the baptism candidates.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,760
 What a wonderful day to celebrate together.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,240
 And so yeah, as Carla said, over the past five weeks,

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,520
 we've been exploring right through the Old Testament,

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,040
 these encounters with God.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,840
 And through looking at the different characters

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,720
 and the encounters they've had,

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,920
 the hope is that you've been challenged,

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,920
 you've been inspired, and hopefully even changed

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,180
 as you start to apply some of these things

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,620
 that we've been talking about into your own life.

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,680
 The whole heart behind this series was that,

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,160
 you know, right at the beginning of the year,

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,140
 I'm not sure if you remember,

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,400
 the word spoken over us by the Lord was intimacy.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,200
 And these encounters prove that God is a God

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,920
 that wants to be close to us,

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,260
 that wants us to be close to him,

20
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,680
 that wants to reveal things about himself to us

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,380
 so that we can get to know him.

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,920
 However, and this is the other side of the coin,

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,400
 being close to God, encountering him in all we do,

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,680
 knowing and feeling the love of Jesus

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,160
 is not necessarily the end goal

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,920
 of what it means to call yourself a Christian.

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,240
 And yes, over the summer, right,

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,360
 we've had some incredible moments in this room,

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,120
 even this morning today.

30
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,600
 There have been times where we've been worshiping

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,760
 when it feels like we're worshiping

32
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,560
 with the angels themselves in heaven, right?

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,240
 Just really passionate, intimate moments of worship.

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,520
 There have been stories and testimonies shared

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,440
 where we've been moved,

36
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,880
 it's been encouraging for our souls.

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
 You've heard sermons, hopefully that you've said,

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
 "Yes, that's a word for me, that's so good,

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,680
 "I really resonate with that."

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,000
 We've been growing with numbers, as you can see,

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,760
 we're busting at the seams with overflow sometimes,

42
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,680
 community groups have been going.

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,680
 All this shows, yes, there has been sort of life

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,360
 in the church, and we thank God for this,

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,240
 and it's amazing and it's a blessing,

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,360
 but it makes being part of this community so exciting.

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,760
 Coming here on a Sunday is an amazing experience

48
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,320
 that we all get to enjoy together.

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,240
 But still, this is not the main goal.

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,560
 Because if all we've done is created life

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,000
 inside this building, inside the church,

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,120
 I feel like we've been missing one of the key parts

53
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,640
 of what it means to be called a disciple,

54
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,520
 to be called a follower of Jesus.

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,560
 And in fact, if this is all that we've achieved,

56
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,120
 maybe we've been wasting our time even,

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,260
 and God might not be as pleased with us

58
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,400
 as we think that he is.

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,880
 And we risk missing out on one of the main points,

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,600
 one of the most glorious things about what it means

61
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,340
 to be a disciple, to be a follower of Jesus.

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,880
 So what is this point I'm talking about?

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,600
 Well, you may have noticed that each time

64
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,840
 our Bible characters as an encounter with God,

65
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,280
 there is a mission, there is a greater purpose

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,320
 that goes along with it.

67
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,300
 It's not just for that person's benefit.

68
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,700
 In fact, as you've been led through the series,

69
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,320
 most of the time, it's at great cost and inconvenience

70
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,800
 for that person, great sacrifice for that person

71
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,080
 who God encounters.

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,880
 But there's always a bigger impact to those around them.

73
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,720
 We didn't look at the prophet Jeremiah.

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,600
 I saved us from that, 'cause Jeremiah is a key example

75
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,400
 of a prophet that encounters God, God speaks to him,

76
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,360
 and he hates it, actually.

77
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,920
 But he's like, "Stop speaking to me, Lord.

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
 "I can't take this."

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,000
 But it feels like there's a fire inside his bones.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,760
 You know that Bible verse.

81
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,960
 Because God has spoken to him,

82
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,480
 he can't help but speak it back out.

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,760
 But it's not a comfortable position for him to be in.

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,580
 With Jacob, we see he wrestles with God.

85
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,360
 But the greater impact was to inspire

86
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,840
 the birth of a new nation.

87
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,360
 For Joshua, he encounters God,

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,480
 but the bigger part of that was to prove to the Canaanites

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,800
 that God is the only one true God.

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,360
 For Daniel, as he wrestles with King Darius

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,920
 and he gets thrown into the lion's den,

92
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,880
 he encounters God in the lion's den.

93
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,280
 The bigger impact that comes from that

94
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,240
 is the decree that comes at the end

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,560
 where the whole kingdom, king degrees,

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,720
 has to now worship God.

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,120
 For Elijah, it was a reminder to turn the Israelites

98
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,960
 back to God away from idol worship.

99
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
 For Hannah, it was the call for her to,

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,920
 she did eventually give birth to a child,

101
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,800
 but then she turns around and sacrifices

102
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,960
 and gives that child back to the Lord.

103
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,980
 And so it's the same for us today.

104
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,040
 We don't want to encounter God

105
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 so that the church on Sundays can be this amazing gathering

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,320
 that we get to enjoy this week, each week.

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,200
 Yes, it's a privilege we get to do this,

108
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,880
 but what we really should be asking for

109
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,640
 is for God to encounter us so that he can use this body

110
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,080
 to work through his church, to disrupt our lives,

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,840
 to enter out of our wills and purposes

112
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,200
 so that he can be made known to others.

113
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,740
 That is what we're trying to do here this morning.

114
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,500
 God's heart is that we would encounter him

115
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,800
 so that we can make him known to everyone else.

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,860
 Psalm 46 makes this point well.

117
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,760
 Okay, Bible quiz for one second, okay?

118
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,700
 Finish this verse, "Be still and know that I am God."

119
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,380
 What comes next?

120
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,020
 But you know that's not the end of this verse, right?

121
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,740
 But we sing this song, right, the song "Still,"

122
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,780
 and we feel God close to us, but the proper end,

123
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,660
 this is not the end of this verse.

124
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,620
 So it sort of misses the point.

125
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,700
 Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing on "Still," okay?

126
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,300
 It's one of my favorite songs, I love that song.

127
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,620
 It's carried me through some deep seasons

128
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,300
 of trouble in my life.

129
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,260
 But the entirety of that verse reads like this.

130
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,020
 "Be still and know that I am God.

131
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,480
 "I will be exalted among the nations.

132
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,100
 "I will be exalted in the earth."

133
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,820
 In other words, church is not about us.

134
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,980
 What God is really saying here is,

135
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,140
 be still and let me know that I'm close to you.

136
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,780
 That's not what he's saying.

137
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,620
 But what he's saying is,

138
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,900
 be still so that you can see I am God

139
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,940
 that is exalted over everything in this world, right?

140
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,220
 And that hits a little bit different

141
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
 when we look at it from that perspective

142
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,780
 in its entire context.

143
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,300
 Because it's not just about knowing God,

144
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,420
 it's about making him known.

145
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,940
 And all this talk about encountering God,

146
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,580
 yes, it should give you a deeper appreciation of God,

147
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,700
 a more intimate relationship with him.

148
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,340
 Yes, it should have strengthened your faith,

149
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,460
 but at the same time,

150
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,940
 it should have also given you a deeper love for others.

151
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,240
 Because this is God's heart for the world.

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,900
 It should have also led you to a desire

153
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,500
 to let other people know about him.

154
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,460
 It should have motivated you to think like,

155
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,060
 oh my goodness, God is so good, God is so amazing.

156
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,140
 This encounter I've had has been so powerful,

157
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,020
 I cannot possibly keep it to myself anymore.

158
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,860
 I have to tell someone about this.

159
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,140
 All people everywhere, all the time,

160
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,180
 need to know who God is.

161
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,940
 And I'm not gonna give myself rest

162
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,980
 until everyone knows out there

163
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,060
 that there is a God exalted over everything in this world.

164
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,900
 Amen?

165
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,020
 This is what our purpose is.

166
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,460
 This is what the church is for.

167
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,860
 In fact, this is so important to God's heart.

168
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,140
 Jesus' last words before he went into heaven

169
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,740
 was a command to make this happen.

170
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,260
 Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth

171
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,620
 "has been given to me.

172
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,200
 "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,

173
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,160
 "baptizing them in the name of the Father

174
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,820
 "and of the Son of the Holy Spirit,

175
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,720
 "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you,

176
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,700
 "and surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age."

177
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,300
 The Great Commission, Matthew 28.

178
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,620
 In another version of this, he says it like this.

179
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,920
 "But you will receive power

180
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,460
 "when the Holy Spirit comes on you,

181
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,520
 "and you will be my witnesses, my declarers,

182
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,060
 "in Jerusalem, in Judea, and Samaria,

183
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,780
 "and to the ends of the earth."

184
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,620
 Acts 1:8.

185
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,020
 Right, notice what Jesus didn't say.

186
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,060
 He didn't say the last thing he said.

187
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,620
 You know, "Hey, don't forget to come to church every Sunday."

188
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,440
 Right?

189
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,280
 That's not what he said.

190
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,740
 He didn't say, "Hey, don't forget to join up

191
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,660
 "to the community groups."

192
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,480
 He didn't say, "Don't forget to give your tithes

193
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,780
 "and your offerings."

194
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,300
 His last and final instructions were to go.

195
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,440
 Go and tell people about me.

196
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,040
 Go and tell people who God is.

197
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,860
 Go and be a witness to people

198
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,740
 about your encounters with me.

199
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,860
 Make disciples, baptize them,

200
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,300
 teach them what I've taught you.

201
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,660
 These are verbs, these are action words

202
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,860
 called for us to go and do.

203
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,100
 So the question today is,

204
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,660
 are we doing the work of making disciples?

205
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,480
 Are we proclaiming to Jesus

206
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,020
 is to those who don't know him yet?

207
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,540
 Are we taking action to make Jesus known to everyone?

208
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,940
 And how do we do this, church?

209
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,660
 We do this by preaching the word.

210
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,500
 If we want God to be lifted high in this world,

211
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,060
 if we want Jesus to be exalted as a name above all names,

212
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,320
 we, as his children, as his body, have to preach the word.

213
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,520
 And this is the challenge from scripture

214
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,980
 for all of us today.

215
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,080
 Now, I'm not gonna try and sugarcoat anything

216
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
 because it is a massive challenge.

217
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,400
 But I believe it's one that we are all,

218
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,020
 every single person in this room, is called to respond to.

219
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,760
 It's a challenge that if we can commit

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,480
 to doing our very best to meet it,

221
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,460
 this will be the kind of community,

222
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,660
 the kind of society, the kind of church

223
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,080
 that Jesus is looking for.

224
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,300
 That's my introduction, okay?

225
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,700
 So let's look at today's passage.

226
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,000
 I'm reading from 2 Timothy 4, one to five.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
 It says this.

228
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,920
 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus

229
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,600
 who will judge the living and the dead,

230
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,780
 and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,

231
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,160
 I give you this charge.

232
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,000
 I give you this charge.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,160
 Preach the word.

234
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,920
 Be prepared in season and out of season.

235
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,960
 Correct, rebuke, encourage with great patience

236
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,400
 and careful instruction.

237
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,680
 For the time will come when people

238
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
 will not put up with sound doctrine.

239
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,280
 Instead, to suit their own desires,

240
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,520
 they will gather around with them a great number of teachers

241
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,760
 to say what their itching ears want to hear.

242
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
 They will turn their ears away from the truth

243
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,120
 and turn aside to myths.

244
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,320
 But you, keep your head in all situations.

245
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,000
 Endure hardship.

246
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Do the work of an evangelist.

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,680
 Discharge all the duties of your ministry.

248
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,520
 Okay, this is good, I think.

249
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,660
 No one's running out the door so far, okay.

250
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,820
 So I'm gonna take it as, if you're sitting here

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,800
 continuing to listen, I'm gonna take it as

252
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,480
 thinking that you mean everyone's buying in.

253
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,520
 You're saying yes, we want to learn

254
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,720
 what it means to do this.

255
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,620
 Together we want to preach God's word.

256
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,400
 So we'll get to that in a minute.

257
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,280
 But before Paul gets to the how, how do we do this,

258
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,360
 first he gives us a sense of why.

259
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,220
 And the why is actually quite,

260
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,860
 it's a good reminder for us.

261
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,200
 The why is because time is running out.

262
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,020
 Paul starts his charge with a sense of urgency.

263
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,700
 He's telling us, this isn't something we can save for later.

264
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,040
 This isn't something that you put on the back burner.

265
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,500
 It's not a slow cooker moment.

266
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,100
 We'll wait and check on it later to see what happens.

267
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,940
 Preaching the word is a challenge

268
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,980
 that needs to be responded to today, right now.

269
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,800
 Time is of the essence.

270
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,300
 He says it like this, in the presence of God

271
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,760
 and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead,

272
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,120
 and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,

273
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
 I give you this charge.

274
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,040
 As Paul was writing this letter,

275
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,520
 he's writing to a young protégé,

276
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,160
 a young follower, disciple of his, called Timothy.

277
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,520
 And during the time of Paul's writing,

278
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,960
 he's in deep trouble, actually.

279
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,400
 He's imprisoned because of his dedication

280
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,360
 to preaching the gospel.

281
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,680
 And this time, he seems to be aware

282
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,400
 that his time on earth is limited.

283
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,080
 He feels like he could be executed any moment now.

284
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,640
 He's had a few run-ins with the law.

285
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,360
 He's been in prison a bunch of times.

286
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,840
 But this time, he just senses,

287
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,040
 he just knows something is different.

288
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,280
 I don't have much time left, so I have to tell you this.

289
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,940
 But this is also a reminder for us.

290
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,840
 Now, I'm not sure how often you think

291
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,000
 about the brevity of life.

292
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
 I know it's a bit of a morbid thing to think about,

293
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,920
 but probably day to day,

294
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
 hopefully it's not something we focus on too much.

295
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
 It kind of gets us down.

296
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,320
 But as your day goes past, the sun goes up,

297
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,880
 the sun goes down.

298
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
 We live our lives.

299
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,000
 We wake up, brush your teeth, hopefully,

300
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,080
 have breakfast, get ready to work,

301
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,840
 drop the kids off at school,

302
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,920
 argue with your partner over what to have for dinner,

303
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,600
 send memes to your bestie on Instagram,

304
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,840
 go shopping, do exercise,

305
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,360
 decide what to watch on Netflix,

306
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,200
 and then fall asleep in front of the TV, right?

307
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,720
 All the day to day routine of things.

308
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,640
 Occasionally, we might look to the future and say,

309
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
 okay, I'm gonna go on holiday here or there sometime.

310
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,480
 But here's the reality, church.

311
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,320
 The reality is tomorrow is not guaranteed for any of us.

312
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,320
 Everyone's time on this earth could end at any moment.

313
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,480
 And when that happens, we find ourselves,

314
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,920
 we're going to find ourselves face to face with Jesus.

315
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,200
 Life on earth will end in two ways.

316
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,720
 Either your body will stop working

317
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,240
 and there's a whole bunch of stuff

318
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,200
 that can cause that to happen,

319
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
 or Jesus comes back and nobody apart from the Father

320
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,280
 knows when exactly that's gonna be.

321
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,200
 The truth is, we don't know.

322
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,440
 We'll never know how close we are to the final day

323
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,800
 until it actually hits us.

324
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,280
 Which is why the Bible tells us to be careful how we live.

325
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,640
 Which is why it tells us where we're to live each day

326
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,680
 as people ready to meet Jesus face to face.

327
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,520
 Because when we do meet him face to face,

328
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
 we have to be ready because that means

329
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,720
 it's time for judgment, right?

330
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,280
 We're gonna meet Jesus face to face.

331
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,720
 Either he's gonna come back to fully reclaim this earth,

332
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,120
 and when we do see him,

333
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,040
 there's gonna be some questions he's gonna ask us.

334
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,160
 He's coming back, it says,

335
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,200
 to judge the living and the dead.

336
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,240
 So what's he gonna judge us on?

337
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,880
 Well, he's gonna ask us questions, I think,

338
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
 things like this.

339
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,520
 Have you been a good and faithful servant?

340
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,680
 Have you loved me with all your heart,

341
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,440
 mind, soul, and strength?

342
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,680
 Have you loved others as I have loved you?

343
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,200
 Have you looked after the widows and the orphans?

344
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
 Have you been a voice of justice

345
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,240
 to the weak and the oppressed?

346
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,000
 All of which can be summed up in this question, I think.

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,040
 Have you preached the word of God?

348
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,080
 Church, are we living in the light of Jesus's return?

349
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,960
 Do we live life knowing that it could

350
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,560
 truly be over at any moment?

351
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,320
 And because of this, do we realize

352
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
 that there's a severe urgency in the way we live?

353
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,200
 Because of this, we have to preach the word.

354
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,280
 Preach the word, be prepared in and out of season

355
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,520
 to correct, rebuke, encourage with great patience

356
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,440
 and careful instruction.

357
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,880
 Preach the word, church.

358
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,320
 Okay, I know, this is the preacher on a Sunday

359
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,880
 telling people to preach the word, right?

360
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,920
 This is your job, right?

361
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,320
 We pay you to do this, right?

362
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
 This is what you're important for, Alison.

363
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,640
 And yes, right, part of what we do on a Sunday

364
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,800
 is to preach the word.

365
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,280
 And for me, on a personal level,

366
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,640
 I feel like this is something that God's called me to do,

367
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,840
 I enjoy doing, right?

368
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,400
 This is a part of my ministry.

369
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,160
 However, the word preached does not mean

370
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,560
 the preaching, the teaching, unpacking of God's word

371
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,320
 at 11, 15, 12, and 9 or 15 on a Sunday, right?

372
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,880
 That's not what it means.

373
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,000
 Preach simply means to proclaim or to talk about.

374
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
 And when Paul says the word,

375
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,960
 it's not referring to just the actual words

376
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,360
 of scripture itself, but the word is really referring

377
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,560
 to the overall Christian message, right?

378
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,040
 The message of truth and love and hope.

379
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,640
 The message that King Jesus is the one

380
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,680
 who is the one true King, King of all kings.

381
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,920
 He loved you enough to go to the cross for you

382
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,560
 as a sacrifice.

383
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,000
 That is life, death, and resurrection means grace,

384
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,520
 mercy, and forgiveness to all who will put their trust

385
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,360
 in him.

386
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,920
 But here's the other thing as well.

387
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,440
 Preaching is not just with words.

388
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,280
 Part of preaching also has to be how we live our lives,

389
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,720
 right?

390
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,040
 Do we live a life that is in tune with Jesus?

391
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,360
 Like I was saying just now, do we love others like he does?

392
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,800
 Do we serve the poor and the marginalized?

393
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,360
 Are we living in the truth?

394
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,320
 Do we resist temptation and evil?

395
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,640
 We preach the word also when we live a life

396
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,280
 that reflects the life of Jesus.

397
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,160
 So preaching the word means talking about

398
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,760
 and demonstrating the message of Jesus.

399
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,960
 Now this is something everyone can do.

400
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,400
 Not just the man behind the, not just the person,

401
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,320
 the man or woman behind the pulpit,

402
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,720
 but every single person.

403
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
 And this challenge is one that we've got to,

404
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,040
 we have to live by all of the time.

405
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,280
 In Paul's word he says, "In season and out of season."

406
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
 Now if you look through my Instagram algorithm,

407
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,320
 there's a lot of random stuff,

408
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,200
 a lot of parenting tips, pranks you play on people,

409
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,960
 easy recipes, but also motivational things, right?

410
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,920
 There's a motivational guy, I'm not gonna call his name,

411
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,160
 he uses a lot of very colorful language.

412
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,040
 Sometimes I listen to him to get myself

413
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,760
 to get ready to work out or something like that.

414
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,600
 But if motivational quotes are your thing,

415
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,360
 you've probably heard some of these, right?

416
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,000
 Failure to prepare is what?

417
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,640
 Preparation to fail.

418
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,160
 Ooh, yeah.

419
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,840
 Stay ready so you don't have to get ready.

420
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,200
 All those kind of things, right?

421
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,920
 Now, this is something that I've noticed.

422
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,560
 We like to apply this mindset

423
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,400
 to certain aspects of our life, right?

424
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,960
 Stay on the grind.

425
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,920
 Right, when it comes to things like working out

426
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,320
 or chasing your personal goal, reaching your dreams,

427
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,760
 come on, yeah, no days off, let's get it,

428
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
 let's go, let's go, let's go, right?

429
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
 These are the kind of things

430
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,640
 that we like to motivate ourselves with.

431
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,960
 But for some reason when it comes to preaching

432
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,480
 and living out the word, whew,

433
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
 suddenly we don't feel like we're ready.

434
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,760
 Suddenly we're full of excuses.

435
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,840
 Things like, oh, you know,

436
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 I don't really know the Bible well enough yet

437
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,800
 to go and talk to that person about it.

438
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,640
 It's gonna be really awkward if I ask that person

439
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,560
 and if I can pray for them, right?

440
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,320
 Now, this person's gonna think I'm a weirdo

441
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,720
 if I ask them if they want to know who Jesus is.

442
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,240
 You know, I don't have much time right now.

443
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,560
 I'm busy.

444
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,760
 I'll serve the community next year.

445
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,520
 It's not just a good time for me right now.

446
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,080
 I'm gonna wait for a better occasion before I,

447
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,520
 you can fill in the blank.

448
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,880
 But God's word here gives us no room for excuses.

449
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
 And the truth is this,

450
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,640
 if we're always waiting for the right time,

451
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,560
 we'll always find a right reason to put it off.

452
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,920
 This is what procrastination is.

453
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,360
 Like, trust me, okay?

454
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,120
 Like my wife always says, don't you know,

455
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,360
 I always say to my wife, excuse me,

456
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,080
 don't remind me every six months, okay?

457
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
 I'm gonna get round to fixing that cupboard

458
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,160
 in the wardrobe, okay?

459
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,560
 Procrastination, I wrestle with it.

460
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,400
 But here's the point.

461
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,360
 If we only preach the gospel in times

462
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,600
 and conditions were right, it would never get done.

463
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,920
 And the challenge here is this,

464
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,120
 whether the time seems right or not,

465
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,760
 that's not what matters.

466
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,960
 What matters is your readiness and your willingness

467
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
 to preach the word.

468
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,040
 Paul is saying here, preaching the word

469
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,240
 isn't something that we clock in and out of,

470
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,960
 something that we can just complementalize

471
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,160
 as part of our lives, but this is something,

472
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,520
 if we want to stay on the grind for something,

473
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,080
 do it for the sake of preaching the gospel.

474
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,600
 Now, I'll caveat with this.

475
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,080
 At the same time, right, this doesn't constantly mean

476
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,280
 going round bashing people in the head with a Bible.

477
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
 That's not what it's calling us to do here, though.

478
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,560
 All right, don't get weird about it.

479
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,400
 Maybe you know people like this too, right?

480
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
 You can't even have a normal conversation.

481
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,280
 For someone like this, say,

482
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,560
 you ask them for a cup of water because you're thirsty,

483
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,240
 and instead of just handing you a cup of water,

484
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,560
 they'll say something like,

485
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,520
 oh, I know you're thirsty, brother,

486
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,720
 but do you know something else?

487
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,680
 You should be thirsty for the Lord, you know,

488
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,360
 and you need the Holy Spirit in your life, right?

489
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,520
 Don't be that guy either, okay?

490
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,160
 That's not what it's calling us to do.

491
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,760
 The key here, okay, is to be prepared.

492
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,320
 Be prepared so that when that moment comes,

493
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,480
 whenever that is, whether it's convenient or not,

494
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,400
 you are ready to preach the Word.

495
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,960
 And we preach this Word, we believe in this Word,

496
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,880
 we live by this Word because the Word has power.

497
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,840
 In other places, Paul would say that the Word

498
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,040
 is like a double-edged sword, dividing soul and spirit.

499
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,760
 Early in the book of 2 Timothy,

500
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,960
 the Word is described as useful for teaching,

501
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,320
 rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.

502
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,280
 In Romans, it tells us that faith comes

503
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,480
 from hearing the Word, and the Word is heard through,

504
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,840
 and the message is heard through the Word about Christ.

505
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,720
 Isaiah tells us that the only thing

506
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,320
 that's gonna last forever in this world is the Word of God.

507
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,720
 And Paul here says the Word has the power.

508
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,440
 It's got power to change people's lives.

509
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,960
 It's got the power to correct, rebuke, and encourage.

510
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,920
 Again, let's pause here to take a look at these words

511
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,480
 because they sound kind of serious,

512
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,640
 kind of scary, kind of judgmental.

513
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,200
 But I think what Paul's trying to do here

514
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,160
 is explain how the power of God's Word

515
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,920
 has an immediate effect on our lives.

516
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,200
 So the first word he says is to correct.

517
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,060
 Correct means that the Word is able

518
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,920
 to guide us back onto the right path.

519
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,960
 Scripture says the Word of the Lord is a lamp to my feet

520
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,280
 and a guide unto my path.

521
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,280
 Now, this might make us a bit nervous

522
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,680
 because we live in a time and age

523
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,280
 where things don't really seem to have a right and a wrong.

524
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,300
 Right, and when this is the case,

525
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,160
 then there isn't really anything to correct.

526
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,660
 What's true for you might not be true for me,

527
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,580
 but that's okay, right?

528
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,280
 We'll just agree to disagree.

529
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,480
 But the fact that God's Word can be used to correct

530
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,040
 means that there is a right way.

531
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,640
 There is an objective truth

532
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,880
 that we can point people back towards.

533
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,240
 There is a standard which God expects His people to live by.

534
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,240
 And God's Word is how we know what that is.

535
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,680
 It's through God's Word that we know

536
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,940
 how He wants us to live.

537
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,240
 It's through God's Word that we can always

538
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,640
 point our lives back when it seems to go off course.

539
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,920
 His Word becomes like the north star in our life

540
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,460
 by which we navigate our life by.

541
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,920
 So it's useful for correcting.

542
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,760
 Now rebuking is the next word.

543
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,640
 This word might make us even more nervous

544
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,120
 because it's not just about now

545
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,320
 pointing out something that is wrong.

546
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,960
 It sounds like it's giving some kind of punishment.

547
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,000
 But again, you know, the world might say, "How dare you?

548
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 "Who do you think you are

549
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,160
 "to have the right to rebuke people?"

550
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,400
 But again, let me give you another way to look at it.

551
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,080
 If we're the ones who know the Word, right,

552
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,360
 and we believe the Word is the truth,

553
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
 if we're the ones that know the Word is the truth

554
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,760
 and it's the correct way to live,

555
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,120
 and we see people around us going down a path

556
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,160
 that is away from the Word,

557
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,120
 going in the wrong direction,

558
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,040
 in a direction that's going to lead to pain

559
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,900
 and destruction and death instead of life,

560
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,800
 and life in the full,

561
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,400
 then you tell me what's the more loving thing to do.

562
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,920
 To continue to let that person

563
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,620
 or those people go down that path?

564
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,960
 Or do everything you can to pull them back

565
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,280
 towards the truth, to rebuke and to correct,

566
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,000
 to lead them back on the path that leads to Jesus?

567
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,020
 Okay, but here's the key.

568
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,660
 And this is very important as well,

569
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,120
 because often this is the part I think we get wrong.

570
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,160
 Because when our methods of correcting and rebuking

571
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,680
 are not done in the right way,

572
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,880
 it can actually be really damaging

573
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,240
 and leads to hurting people.

574
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,020
 It leads to Christians being labeled

575
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,600
 and sometimes justifiably as being mean

576
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,380
 and arrogant, judgmental, hypocritical.

577
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,060
 So when we talk about correcting and rebuking,

578
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,280
 it has to be done in the right way.

579
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,420
 Which is why Paul adds at the end of this,

580
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,720
 the right way to do this is through encouragement.

581
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,900
 To encourage means to urge,

582
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,600
 to come alongside, to support,

583
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,260
 not to bash over the head, okay?

584
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,780
 That's not encouraging.

585
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,300
 And with encouragement, it's also done

586
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,860
 with great patience and careful instruction.

587
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,820
 You see, we just correct and rebuke

588
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,000
 without patience and grace,

589
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,580
 that does not reflect the heart of God.

590
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:44,380
 And we come off as jerks and bad and hypocritical.

591
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,340
 Actually, when we do this,

592
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,780
 we don't just dishonor the name of yourself,

593
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,400
 but it also dishonors the name of Jesus.

594
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,180
 It makes him seem like a bad guy who's not caring,

595
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,820
 who's not patient, who's not full of grace and mercy.

596
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,340
 We have to understand that it's a journey

597
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,280
 to learn how to live according to the word,

598
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,220
 just like it's been a journey for you.

599
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,400
 And we can't expect people to get it right straight away.

600
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,580
 And when we rebuke without careful instruction,

601
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,900
 it leaves people feeling confused and frustrated.

602
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,620
 It's like telling somebody that they're wrong,

603
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,380
 but never explaining why.

604
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,940
 And when we correct without patience,

605
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,260
 it leaves people feeling frustrated and uncared for,

606
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,620
 like there's some sort of project

607
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,860
 that we've been sent to fix

608
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,420
 just to take that off our list.

609
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:38,020
 So it has to be done with love, with grace,

610
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,580
 with mercy, with great patience and encouragement.

611
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,780
 And then Paul wants us to understand this,

612
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,120
 scripture wants us to understand this,

613
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,180
 it's not going to be easy.

614
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,280
 Preaching and living out the word

615
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,020
 is going to come with a whole lot of pushback,

616
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,580
 resistance and even rebellion.

617
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,860
 He says it like this, "For the time will come

618
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,540
 when people will not put up with sound doctrine.

619
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,320
 Instead, to suit their own desires,

620
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,620
 they will gather around them a great number of teachers

621
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,460
 to say what the itching ears want to hear.

622
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,140
 They will turn away from the truth and turn aside to myths."

623
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,620
 Right, in other words, there is a time coming

624
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,620
 when people will not like the word that we're gonna bring.

625
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,920
 Right, they're not gonna like the word

626
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,360
 that is gonna keep them close to God.

627
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,500
 They're not gonna like the word

628
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,360
 that will help them be more like Jesus.

629
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,540
 They're not gonna like teaching

630
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,500
 that's gonna keep them strong in the Lord.

631
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,840
 They're not gonna like it

632
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,240
 when they're corrected and rebuked

633
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,760
 because in their minds, they've already made up,

634
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,080
 you know, the decision of what is right and what is wrong.

635
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,920
 So instead of listening to the truth,

636
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,340
 instead of listening to what is good,

637
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,080
 they will simply find people to tell them

638
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,640
 whatever it is they want to hear,

639
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,620
 to tickle their ears,

640
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,780
 to make them feel better about themselves,

641
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,320
 thinking they can just rest easy,

642
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,920
 ignoring the fact that like we said at the beginning,

643
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,200
 Jesus is coming back to judge.

644
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,860
 And one day, we're gonna have to give an account

645
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,720
 of how we've lived to him.

646
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,380
 This isn't a prophetic warning over the church.

647
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,600
 Now, let's look at it this way, okay?

648
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,780
 Suppose you go for a checkup with your doctor

649
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,660
 and the doctor tells you, "You know what?

650
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,500
 "Cholesterol's looking kind of high.

651
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 "Sugar level's kind of high.

652
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,020
 "Your heart's struggling a bit.

653
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,920
 "Maybe lay off the sugary foods, you know,

654
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,700
 "do more exercise, drink more water, sleep earlier.

655
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,260
 "Make a few changes because you're not healthy, right?"

656
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,660
 Oh, okay, not my recent checkup, I hope, okay?

657
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,060
 But imagine you went to the doctor and they told you that.

658
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,580
 Oh, but you don't want to do that, right?

659
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,980
 You want donuts for life.

660
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,880
 You say, "I'm not here for a long time.

661
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,580
 "I'm here for a good time, right?

662
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,960
 "I don't want to be skinny and healthy.

663
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,220
 "I want to be fat and happy," right?

664
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,180
 And so you keep finding doctors.

665
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,260
 You keep finding doctors until you one find that says,

666
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,540
 "Oh, yeah, you know, whatever, yeah, it's high,

667
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,440
 "but it's not like really high."

668
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,500
 And actually, you know what?

669
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,100
 Donuts actually have a lot of nutrients in them, right?

670
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,540
 So like, donuts aren't the worst, okay?

671
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,340
 So in fact, you know what?

672
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:13,220
 I've read a recent report that sweat's not good for you.

673
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,740
 It clogs up your pores, right?

674
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,580
 And so, and you know, too much water isn't bad.

675
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,320
 You need some electrolytes in your life as well.

676
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,380
 So you know, like fizzy drinks, that's also fine, right?

677
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,280
 This is the kind of thinking that the church

678
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,840
 is in danger of, right?

679
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,640
 The trend that people just wanting to hear

680
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,760
 whatever they want to hear.

681
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,160
 The trend of people being told, "You're fine.

682
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,020
 "Don't change.

683
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,600
 "You don't need to discipline yourself.

684
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,780
 "You don't need to believe everything that Jesus says.

685
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,240
 "You do you, and it's all good."

686
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,000
 Listen, if you want to have your ears tickled,

687
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,240
 there are gonna be people out there

688
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,880
 who will tickle your ears in all sorts of ways.

689
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,560
 People like, not gonna go there, okay?

690
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,440
 But there will be people, okay, that will lie to you,

691
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,480
 okay, and say things like, "Jesus promised you prosperity.

692
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,920
 "You just gotta name it and claim it,

693
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,360
 "and then it's yours," right?

694
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,340
 That's what Jesus says, right?

695
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,720
 They will take a verse like Psalm 37, four.

696
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,600
 Look, it says right here in the Bible,

697
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
 "God will give you the desires of your heart."

698
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,320
 So you're just gonna pray to God,

699
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,920
 and he's gonna give you everything you want, right?

700
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,960
 They will twist and turn and corrupt the word of God

701
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,980
 so that people can feel as though they're following him

702
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,120
 without any cost, without any discipline,

703
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,040
 without any sacrifice in their lives.

704
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,480
 All this to say, if we're gonna commit

705
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,480
 to preaching the word, make sure we're preaching the word,

706
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,800
 not some watered-down, weakened,

707
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,680
 fluffy, ear-tickling version of it.

708
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
 And we have to watch out for this

709
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,020
 because this version is not the gospel.

710
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,200
 It might be what people want to hear,

711
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,340
 but it's not gonna be what they need.

712
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,760
 This version of the word will strip it from its power.

713
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,960
 This version of the word will carry no ability

714
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,840
 to set people free, to bring real hope, real life,

715
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,200
 real salvation to a world out there

716
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,380
 that's lost and suffering.

717
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:11,520
 Woe to me if I don't preach the gospel.

718
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,700
 If we are truly committed to preaching the word,

719
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,520
 this church, brothers and sisters,

720
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,780
 is what we're gonna have to put up with.

721
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,160
 Which is why Paul points us with this final encouragement.

722
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,960
 But you, keep your head.

723
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,320
 In all situations, endure hardship,

724
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
 do the work of an evangelist,

725
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
 discharge all the duties of your ministry.

726
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,740
 In other words, Paul is saying,

727
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,200
 if you're finding this difficult to do,

728
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,640
 if it's a challenge, if it's hard,

729
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,860
 if you're coming against pushback,

730
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,000
 then you're probably doing the right thing.

731
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,600
 We are called to be different.

732
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,760
 We have been called to stand firm.

733
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,960
 We have been called not to turn to this and that,

734
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,240
 but rather, as it says here,

735
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,600
 keep your head in all situations.

736
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,740
 Don't be enticed by these false teachings,

737
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,280
 but focus on what you know is true.

738
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,940
 Endure hardship.

739
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,460
 As we do this, we know it's not going to be easy.

740
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,100
 Like we saw with the people we studied,

741
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,920
 it's gonna be difficult and painful at times,

742
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,140
 but let me ask you this, church,

743
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,800
 did you start following Jesus in order to have an easy life?

744
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,540
 I hope not.

745
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,180
 I hope your decision to follow Jesus

746
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,820
 was because you came to realize that he is the true king.

747
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,900
 You came to follow Jesus because you realized

748
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,060
 he is the only way, the truth, and the life.

749
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,920
 So we go on announcing Jesus is Lord.

750
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,960
 And no matter what happens, what's required is not success

751
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,500
 as the world sees success,

752
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,780
 but rather loyalty and perseverance to preaching his word.

753
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,740
 This is why the task, therefore, is to preach the word,

754
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,540
 do the work of the evangelist,

755
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,300
 an evangelist, the one that preaches and lives out

756
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,900
 and speaks the word of God.

757
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,180
 Never stop proclaiming the gospel in everything that you do.

758
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,040
 There is work to be done.

759
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,500
 And like I said, time is short.

760
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,620
 And now that we've encountered God, we know him,

761
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,760
 we come together each and every Sunday and we encounter him,

762
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,640
 now it's on us to preach the word.

763
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,780
 You may have classmates or schoolmates

764
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,180
 who have not yet heard the gospel.

765
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,640
 There may be family out there

766
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,000
 who are still to discover who Jesus is.

767
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,720
 You have colleagues who are lost and wondering,

768
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,480
 where is the purpose and direction of my life?

769
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,280
 There's an opportunity there to point them towards Jesus.

770
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,240
 We have a city, 90-something percent of our city in Hong Kong

771
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,460
 still don't really know who Jesus is.

772
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,280
 And look around us, church.

773
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,160
 Each week we have more than 1,000 people,

774
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,040
 that's a lot of people, coming into this building.

775
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,260
 We worship, we connect, we encourage, we love, we care,

776
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,640
 we give, we do all these things within the building

777
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,040
 in the name of Jesus.

778
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,360
 And I love this church, I love the community,

779
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,240
 I love being part of the team here,

780
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,040
 but I'm fully convinced also

781
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,820
 that this is not all it's meant to be.

782
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,360
 And at the end of every Sunday, I always think to myself,

783
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,800
 what if, what if every single person here

784
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,920
 committed to preaching the word outside of this space?

785
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,660
 What if every single person here

786
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,080
 committed to help people around them

787
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,300
 to come to a faith in Jesus through encouragement,

788
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,180
 through love, through patience, no matter how hard it gets?

789
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,720
 This is the key, this is how the world is changed.

790
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,480
 Look, it started from 12 disciples following Jesus

791
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,520
 to the billions of Christians

792
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,920
 that we see worshiping Jesus today.

793
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,360
 And that mission, that call continues for us

794
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,500
 to go and continue to preach the word.

795
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,100
 This is how we truly fulfill our purpose

796
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,140
 of lifting up the name of Jesus.

797
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:24,140
 So church, I challenge us, I challenge you and myself,

798
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,480
 preach the word in and out of season.

799
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,940
 Carry out your giftings, use them for the glory of God,

800
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,320
 to show the people around you who God truly is.

801
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,100
 This is what we've been called to do as a body of Christ.

802
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,100
 If you would close your eyes for a minute,

803
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,060
 I'm gonna pray for us, I'm gonna give us some guidance

804
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,420
 around what now to do next.

805
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,840
 (soft music)

806
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:06,300
 As we've been listening and thinking,

807
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,260
 and maybe the Holy Spirit's already been speaking to you

808
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,200
 about a name, someone that you need to go and talk to,

809
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,520
 a task that he's entrusted you to do.

810
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,360
 (soft music)

811
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,040
 A challenge, something that you've put off for a while,

812
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,240
 but now the Lord is reminding you of it.

813
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,200
 Or maybe even a new, a fresh word,

814
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,600
 something that he's revealed to you

815
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,060
 in the course of the past 30 minutes or so.

816
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,620
 Whatever it is, this is something that literally,

817
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,560
 every single person in this room,

818
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,580
 without excuse, can respond to.

819
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,920
 And that there's a task for everyone to do.

820
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,920
 There is a person, there's a situation,

821
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,520
 there's something that you can preach the word of God to

822
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,280
 in your own context, in where God has placed you.

823
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,320
 And so Jesus, I pray that you would reveal those things

824
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,140
 to us.

825
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,600
 We thank you for this, Lord.

826
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,840
 We thank you that you love the world so much,

827
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,600
 and not just the people who are within your church already,

828
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,600
 but our call, Lord, is to make disciples,

829
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,960
 to baptize, to glorify your name, to make it known,

830
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,960
 to tell people out there who need salvation,

831
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,600
 that time is short,

832
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,480
 that life on this earth is precious and fleeting,

833
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,640
 and that Jesus will come back one day.

834
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,720
 So Lord, give us no rest until everyone

835
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,240
 is calling out your name.

836
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,920
 And help us, Lord, use us for the job of preaching your word,

837
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,520
 for the job of, for the task of, for the purpose of

838
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,240
 letting people around you, letting people around us

839
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,600
 know who you are, and how great and how glorious you are,

840
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,640
 but also how loving and kind you are.

841
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,040
 Use this church for this purpose, Lord.

842
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,920
 And family, if you would like to respond to this,

843
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,520
 I just ask you to simply stand up and say,

844
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,160
 I'm gonna do this, Lord.

845
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,800
 I'm not sure why or how or what it means exactly yet,

846
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,040
 but I'm gonna trust in you, Jesus.

847
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,520
 And I'm willing, Lord, to preach the word,

848
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,640
 to make disciples, to let people around me know about you.

849
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,160
 If you're willing to respond to that, church,

850
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,720
 I invite you to stand and worship together

851
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,000
 with your brothers and sisters around you

852
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 to encourage each other in this journey.

853
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,760
 May God lead us and guide us and have mercy on us.

854
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,480
 We do this all in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.

855
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,320
 Amen.

856
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,680
