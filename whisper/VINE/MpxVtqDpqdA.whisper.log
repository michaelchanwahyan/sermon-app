[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   Amen. Thank you, Chapman. Let's give it up for Chapman.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:14.000]   Well, in 2022 on Vision Sunday, Pastor Ivan and I, together with Pastor Andrew, we announced
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.440]   that we are planting a church with an English and a Cantonese service.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.320]   Now, we did that during a time when there was still COVID restrictions, so we had to do it on
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.920]   a live stream, so we did it on camera. And it was actually a funny story, because Pastor Ivan,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.960]   we were experimenting with, what do you call that thing?
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.680]   The teleprompter. But then right when he was going to use it, it failed.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.320]   But he was prepared anyhow, so it was no problem. So there's a lot of behind the
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.720]   scene sort of stuff that happened. But besides that, we also mentioned on that Sunday
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.280]   that we did not know where we were going to plant the church. So we said we had six
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.880]   criteria that we're looking for and with which we're going to search. And hopefully,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.080]   that year we had Vision Sunday Part 1 and Part 2, hopefully on Vision Sunday Part 2,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.360]   we will be able to tell the church where we're actually planting the church.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.920]   Now, I just want you to sit in that a little bit, that you're going in front of a group of people
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.120]   and you're saying you're going to do something, but you don't know where you're going to do it.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.600]   And then also, you're doing it on camera, so at that point in time, you can't even physically
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.360]   gather with each other. So there was a statement of an act of faith and of courage
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.360]   that we did that. And there was another part of it. It was part of our vision,
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:59.280]   because we had what's called a river model vision, where there's this image of a river
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.240]   flowing all over across Hong Kong with all the secondary rivers and little creeks.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.440]   And that God wants us, instead of focusing on building one big church,
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.520]   he wants the river to flow throughout Hong Kong, watering thirsty land. And he wants to form new
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.360]   and different types of communities, fresh expressions throughout the land to love,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.720]   to serve, to share the gospel for his kingdom. And we also said this is greater than the wine church.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   This is not just wine church. We're not trying to build empire. We really just want to be obedient
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:48.960]   to God and share the gospel and do his work. Now, all of this, during this time, there was also a
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:59.280]   sense that we had as a leadership that this was a prophetic act. That while other companies were
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.600]   pulling out of Hong Kong, their investments, they were shifting to regional headquarters like
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.720]   Singapore and other Asian hub cities. We felt that God was asking us to double down on investing in
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.000]   Hong Kong. There was the sense that God was saying to us, I'm not finished with Hong Kong.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   But the reality was at the time, there was quite a few people, not everyone,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.960]   but it was quite a few people who at that time felt that way. It was just a very difficult season.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.000]   And so this was an act of faith and of stepping out and then doing what God asked us to do.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.200]   Now, we did not do this on our own. You can't plant a church on your own.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.680]   Otherwise, it'd just be Ivan and I hanging out, having a beer probably, or actually wine.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:00.320]   Truth be told, it'd be wine. It wouldn't be beer. But there was others involved in that. And so I
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:08.560]   actually want to ask those of you who were part of the launch team that met and went shy to stand up.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:22.240]   So you see there's a few people here that were part of that. You can sit down. Thank you so
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:33.440]   much for doing that, for humoring me. So this was a group of brave people who responded not to Ivan
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.280]   and I really, but what God was saying to them and how God was moving and stirring in their hearts.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.160]   And he said, yes, I want to be part of that. I can see what God wants to do. And so I'm going to
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.800]   step out in faith. I'm going to take this risk because it's risky to go out, to leave your
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.240]   comfort. Man, the Vine Church and Wine Shy is home. It's been a place of healing for many of us
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.280]   and a place of friendship and a place, I know for my wife, it's the only place besides here
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:15.360]   now that she's ever been part of a church. And so this was leaving home. But everyone stepped out
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.880]   because they were moved and touched by the Holy Spirit to do so. And I do want to acknowledge
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.120]   that subsequently there's been people stepping out in faith and joining us in what we're doing.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.160]   There's a lot of faith and going back to church, if you haven't been in church in a while,
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.920]   there's a lot of faith and making your gifts and talents available as you join us and helping us
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.000]   carry out this mission and this work that God has given us.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.840]   But what I wanted us to see is it's amazing when we're willing to get out of our comfort zone
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.920]   what God can do. When we make ourselves available to him and Margaret Mead, she was an American
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.680]   cultural anthropologist and a speaker and author, also an Anglican Christian, she said this,
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.000]   "Never doubt a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.320]   that ever has." So it always takes people to step out and take that first step into,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.160]   you know, this new thing that God is doing. And so it's amazing what God has done. And I hope
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.040]   you've been amazed. I know Ivan and I are. And we're just blown away by the work of God, the
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:42.880]   work of the Spirit here in this community. And it's this what we are sensing and are being called
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.960]   to this year again. God is calling us out of our comfort zone into uncharted waters because of the
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.520]   kingdom impact it will have on Hong Kong and because of discipleship impact it will have on us.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:08.240]   Now along with this word of uncharted waters that God has given us, there was also a prophetic
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   image that was shared. This is Pastor Andrew shared this with the church leadership.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.280]   The church leadership discerned and approved that yes, this is a word not just for Wan Chai,
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:30.640]   but it's also a word for Wan Chai, but also a word for Yuen Long as well. And after all,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:38.400]   we are one church in two locations, right? And so this image is of a boat of kind of during like
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:46.720]   earlier days when there was uncharted waters, when you didn't know what lies in that direction if you
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:54.400]   just sail out straight. And so there's this image of a boat heading out and there's an excitement
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:03.200]   among the crew that is heading out on this boat. There's an anticipation and an expectation of
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.960]   what's to come. There's a captain standing at the bow and peering at the horizon, you know,
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.280]   to wondering what were we going to discover? What are we going to find? And the crew is using their
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:21.840]   gifts and talents working together to, because that's the only way it works on these adventures.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.880]   Excuse me.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:45.520]   My apologies. And so the image, but there's also besides a sense of excitement,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   there's also some fear and some anxiety because going in the uncharted waters,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.040]   you know, it's uncomfortable and we don't know what's going to happen. And there's a sense
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:04.240]   of that resilience and courage, you know, we'll be needed flexibility to make adjustments as we go.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:12.560]   And so this was this image that God gave us for this year. Now, this is not a new vision in terms
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.360]   of what we're doing as a church. We still have our river model vision and a growing big people
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:26.800]   vision that we are pursuing together. But now, but this is what God, we sense God inviting us
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   into stepping in these uncharted waters and this uncharted territory. Now, I know that many of you
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.160]   feel like, man, Tim, we just got settled here. We just, we already did the uncharted thing. We
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:45.600]   already went out. Come on. What are you talking about? You know, and we understand that. And
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.560]   it's been amazing, you know, that we made ourselves available. We went and we've experienced what God
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:59.920]   has done. But we sense that last year was a bit of a time of also arresting, you know, of that
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.440]   intimacy. We also talked about, there was a lot of healing. You know, we had the sermons, he's
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:12.400]   longing for healing. We felt that God was doing healing work. And so, but now he's inviting us
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:22.000]   to set out again as a boat together. And we didn't plant this church to stay in the harbor.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:30.400]   You know, we plant this church to set out into the community, into the businesses,
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:38.880]   into your families, into your neighborhoods. And then as we're sailing out, we believe
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:47.040]   that there will be discoveries of the work of God is doing that he wants us to say yes to,
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.240]   to give ourselves to, you know, to these things that God is doing,
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:59.840]   where the spirit of God is moving. And then when we, when you see God work, when he invites you
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.160]   in something, it does take that decisive response. You know, you cannot say, "Oh yeah, okay,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:14.400]   maybe later." No, if God is moving here, this is like a Kairos moment. Like it's an opportune
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.760]   time. We need to respond now. We need to give ourselves to it now. And there's things we're
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.160]   just not going to discover when we just stay here in the harbor. So we have to set out.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:34.000]   And I'm excited about that and excited to see, you know, what God is going to open up for us
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.080]   as we head out together in this community, in our workplaces, and what opportunities he's
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:46.000]   going to give us to give ourselves to, to be part of the work that he is doing of bringing
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.400]   his kingdom more fully on this earth. Now, let me take you to Matthew 13,
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.160]   quite well-known parables. Starting with verse 44, it says this,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:08.240]   "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.520]   And then in his joy, he went out and he sold all he had and bought that field."
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:21.360]   Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.240]   great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. Now, the first parable
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:37.840]   suggests that the kingdom is something that we stumble across. The worker of the field,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.880]   he was not like a treasure seeker with one of those metal detectors.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:48.000]   He was actually just trying to earn his day's wage. And as he was going about his work,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.080]   suddenly he discovered his treasure.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:59.920]   So that's how in the first parable the kingdom comes upon that person.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.040]   And then in the second parable, it suggests that the kingdom is encountered
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:13.760]   because there are expected surprises. So this is somebody who's intentionally seeking. He's
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.920]   seeking for great pearls. It's a merchant. He knows what a good pearl looks like,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:27.120]   but he has to wait until one comes. And as he sees the great one, then he knows what he's seeing,
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.840]   and then he goes for it. So the kingdom of God comes, we stumble across it, but we also
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.200]   seek it out and then discover it because we're seeking it. So I think that's important for us
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:49.440]   in the season. So both parables, they also make the point that this is an opportunity and actually
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:56.640]   also requires us to respond decisively when we come across the kingdom, when we find that treasure,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:05.680]   when we find that pearl of great value. And one thing that stood out to me
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:13.440]   was in the first parable, it talks about that there is great joy of the discovery.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:21.200]   And I think that's important for us because there is a great sacrifice. He sells everything that he
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:28.000]   has. The merchant sells everything that he has. By the way, the day laborer was not a particular
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.040]   wealthy man. He was actually probably a person with not very many resources. And the merchant
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.600]   was probably a wealthy man, a businessman. But when he came across the opportunities,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:50.560]   they had to give their all to respond to it, to have it, to be part, to experience this great joy
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:15:00.320]   and to really receive it. And so the price is high. It's not an easy, "Oh yeah, maybe I'll sell
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:10.560]   piano that I don't like, but I'll keep the stamp that I really like. I'm not going to let go of
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:16.480]   this. I'm going to hold on to my Pokemon card collection and I'll let go of something." No,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:25.200]   it requires a full response, a full giving of ourselves in order to be part of what God is doing.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:34.320]   And so there's a real cost, there's a real risk and chance taking in responding to the kingdom
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:42.000]   when God's reign and the work of God breaks upon us. The same is true for us.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   I mean, we enter the kingdom, of course, when you come to faith, so there's a radical response
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.240]   because it means you're giving up your lordship. Instead of being lord of your own life, right?
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:02.960]   Your Jesus becomes your Lord. So there's a significant shift in that. But then at later
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.640]   times, when the kingdom of God breaks into our lives, it still calls for a radical response.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.560]   And like with the person who found a treasure in the field and the merchant who found this
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:24.000]   incredible pearl, they saw something that other people didn't see. They saw something of tremendous
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.480]   and incredible value. We could say they saw a better possible future. They saw this incredible
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.920]   thing that God was doing. They're like, "I'm going to give myself to that. I want to be part of that.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:44.800]   I believe in this. I want to see this happening." And in order to be part of it and for this to be
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.920]   realized, we have to give ourselves to what God is doing. And there's a sacrifice in that. And
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:57.280]   that's how these things that God is doing, how he allows us to be part of what he's bringing about.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:08.640]   And so in this season, there is great joy when we're going to stumble across these things
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:15.600]   of the kingdom that God is doing. And there's also going to be great joy because we're seeking it out
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.840]   and we see, "Wow, God is moving here. And I want to be part of what God is doing there."
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.440]   And I think that's important because sometimes I feel like in church,
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:33.360]   it's like we're dreading, "Oh, we're being asked to sacrifice." And I don't know if I want to
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.640]   sacrifice. And I think the important part is God first shows you this amazing thing that he's doing.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:48.800]   And there's great joy. There's something within us. We're like, "Yes, I want to be part of that.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.360]   I want to see this thing happen." And that allows us to make the sacrifice because we see the beauty
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   of the work of God. And so there's this parable that kind of gives us a picture of how we need
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.040]   to enter and move into these uncharted waters. It's a season where we'll need to be both
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:20.000]   intentional seeking out the kingdom, but we need to also be ready to respond to these unexpected
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.480]   moves of God that we stumble across when they happen so we can say yes to them.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:31.200]   And like these parables show, it takes decisive action. It doesn't just happen.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   Now, the Divine Church has a bold organizational practice. So we meet twice a month as a staff
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.120]   from One Shining Long together. And one of the things that people can do in the quarters,
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.960]   they can ask any question anonymously. Now, anonymously is always, you just don't know what
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.960]   you're going to get, right? And there are tough questions, but it is really a way of opening a
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.160]   channel for truthful communication. And so early on in the church plan, one of the questions that
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:12.000]   was asked was, "What if the church plan fails?" And so then the question was given to me and
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.080]   then later to Ivan to address. And it was interesting because I was worried about things.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   I was worried, will we have enough people for a launch team? Will we figure out the location?
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.720]   So there was questions I was wondering about, but I didn't think of this church plan in terms of
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.360]   success and failure. But I'm glad the person asked the question because, you know, as we had a chance
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:42.880]   to think about it a little bit and then respond, it was really clear to me that, you know, God had
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:49.200]   moved. He had given us this envision. He had invited us into this work. And for me, failure
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:56.640]   would be not to respond to this thing that God is inviting us to do. You know, for me, failure
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:04.480]   would be not to invest in the kingdom of God. And that would be failure. And so
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:13.600]   for me to fail is if the vine would never seek to plant a church,
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   reach the loss for the gospel of peace and hope, or serve the vulnerable and marginalized.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.120]   You know, for churches that just always play it safe, that never go for it,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:31.920]   you know, we're missing out on what God wants to do. And so he gave us, he had us see this treasure,
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:38.800]   but then we had to give ourselves towards it to make it happen. And then whatever happens is up
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   to him. We just need to be faithful in responding to what he asks us to do. And so this is what God
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:55.680]   is inviting us into. Now I'm excited to invite up Ivan. He's going to share with you something
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.520]   that we're sensing. So we have this theme of uncharted, and he's going to share with you a
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.760]   little bit, some of the things that are in his art. So Ivan, why don't you come up here? Let's
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:15.920]   welcome Ivan. Thank you, Pastor Tim. Yeah. Let me share with you about a group of people in Hong
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:24.640]   Kong that lead us to take risks for. A group of people that are well setting out for into uncharted
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:33.520]   waters because the cost of staying in the harbor is too great. I would like to share a very
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:40.880]   interesting research about recent religions trends in Hong Kong. We can show the slide. A
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:50.720]   2023 Peel Research Center, the report showed that there are raised in religions. It showed
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:59.680]   that this affiliation in a widespread trend in Hong Kong. You can see that we have 37% of people
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:07.920]   reporting they were raised in a religion, but have left their childhood faith, which is the highest
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:18.480]   number in the whole Asia. More over, 30% of people, the report that they were raised without
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:28.800]   a religion, while 61% currently identify as religiously unaffiliated. This is representing
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:38.320]   a 31% of gain in people with no religion affiliation. The percentage of religiously
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:46.880]   unaffiliated grows even more dramatically among young adults aged 18 to 34. You can see the
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:56.720]   number. 74% they show that they are religiously unaffiliated. They are labeled as nones.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:04.720]   That means they are loving in their religions. They are loving their low relationship with God,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:12.720]   any God. This is a percentage showing that it is interesting enough to reflect the phenomenon
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:20.160]   with we have observed in the majority of local churches in Hong Kong nowadays, especially for
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:29.280]   this group of age, younger generation. People have not only left the church, but also abandoned
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:35.040]   their faith. This group of young generation, they not only just left their church,
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:42.000]   stay in the church themselves, the faith themselves, but they left their faith.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.480]   This is clearly a serious and critical situation for our younger generation.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.880]   God led us to plan a church in Yuen Long two years ago. According to government data,
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:02.800]   Yuen Long district is proceeded for continued growth, driven by new town development and
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:14.000]   strategic urban planning. The population of Yuen Long in 2030 is projected to be 700,000.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.920]   700,000. Can you imagine that? 700,000 people in Yuen Long district.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   With over 20%, which means more than 140,000 being young adult age 18 to 34. Tim and I and
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:38.400]   Chapman, we are not in this group, so we can proudly say that they are young generation.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.200]   I saw that there's a lot of young generation among us as well.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:51.280]   This demographic is a critical component of this growth. With chance, I indicated a preference for
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:25:00.560]   newer residential areas, offering more than amenities and affordability. Projections suggest
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:07.040]   that this district, Yuen Long district, will continue to attract younger family and professionals.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.120]   So maybe some of you may live in other districts before, but you just moved to this district
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:21.600]   because of different reasons. But we can see that more and more young families and also young
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.120]   professionals will come to this district. We hope that we can really serve them.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.800]   But where is this young people spiritually?
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:39.840]   They are the missing piece of the church in Hong Kong nowadays.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.160]   They are the future of this city, but they cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:57.120]   They live at home, a spiritual home like us. What I want to emphasize is that we are in the best
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:06.000]   place, the best location, the best timing, the best moment to serve this group of younger generation.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.200]   A spoken person from one of the biggest Hong Kong local research centers told me that
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:22.000]   through their research, they found that the main reason why the younger generation left church
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:30.800]   is not about the context inside the church. It's not about the political stance. It's not about
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:39.200]   leadership issues. This younger generation left church is primarily because they couldn't see
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:48.160]   church making positive impact on this city. They couldn't see that this church, that religion,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.800]   as related to their lives. They couldn't see that the value of the church.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:08.160]   So, church, this is time. This is the time for us as a church to humbly kneel before God,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:15.520]   to step up for our next generation, the younger generation, to let God be God of this city
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:25.920]   and his people, to lift up our voices and give up our own desires, to set ourselves aside for God
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:35.200]   and sacrifice all we have for his kingdom. This is a time for all people to praise and return
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.960]   the glory to God because God himself deserves all the glory. Amen.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.200]   There is a picture, that picture that totally facilitated me.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:54.880]   Imagine there is a church fully and faithfully investing in a group of younger people,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:06.080]   loving them, caring them, encouraging them, empowering them, discipling them, and also
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:13.040]   walk with them for all this, their journey to grow together. Imagine in the coming 20 years,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:20.160]   there are 200 and 300 and 200 young people who have grown as big people.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:27.680]   These people faithfully love their family. They wholeheartedly to serve the church and they
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:37.200]   impactfully, spiritually to impact this city. I believe that this city will definitely change
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:46.800]   with this group of people. They have been discipled. Amen. Amen. So as a church like us,
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:54.400]   in this critical place, critical moment in Hong Kong, in this city, what shall we do?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:02.560]   What shall we do this year? It doesn't mean that we need to serve like 140,000 people,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:09.520]   but we believe that God has given us a specific calling to work for his kingdom.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:17.520]   So let's welcome back Pastor Tim to share what is in our heart, what God put in our heart.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.200]   Thank you, Ivan. Brilliant. Yeah, let's give him a hand.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   [Applause]
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:33.200]   Now, what might these uncharted waters look like for us? Well, the one thing that Ivan and I,
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.680]   and we did wrestle with this prayerfully for a very long time, but the one thing that we both,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:44.640]   our spirits both jumped, you know, is this young adults peace, where we just really sense God's
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:51.040]   heart for the young adults of the city and that we as a church need to step out, get uncomfortable
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:30:03.680]   and do something. And so in 2025, our heart is to plant a third Sunday service that is built on the
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:10.000]   foundation of young people. So we want to get young, this young generation together,
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:19.840]   and then from there launch a third service. And so we sense a strong call to invest
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:27.280]   in this next generation. Somebody has to do it. And we think we're positioned to do it.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:36.080]   Now, going into uncharted territories, you know, it's not comfortable, it's not easy. It means
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.800]   getting out of our comfort zone. Like Ivan shared, there's, you know, the generation,
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:48.160]   a lot of the people in the generation feel like that. Like church doesn't matter. They don't see
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.920]   the relevance of faith and of God and of Jesus, you know, for their own lives and for the city.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:02.000]   And so they just set it aside. And so our challenge is to find ways of showing and modeling,
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.960]   you know, that Jesus and following him and living for him, you know, is worth it.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:18.000]   You know, that he does have an identity, a purpose for their lives, and that it is beautiful and
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.080]   exciting and it is something worth giving themselves to. But for every generation,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.800]   you have to find new ways of sharing this good news and of communicating this truth.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:35.120]   And so there's going to be some effort and some energy and some getting uncomfortable
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:43.920]   that will be needed for this uncharted work. But as I was preparing this, I just really had to sense,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:51.360]   you know, someone got out of their comfort zone and got uncomfortable for your sake,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:57.040]   to share the gospel with you. You know, somebody got uncomfortable for you.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:05.120]   And so I just wondered, church, are we going to be willing to be uncomfortable to share this
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.800]   beautiful gospel message? It's good news, right? Are we going to be willing to be uncomfortable
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:17.040]   to share this good news with a generation that where many of them right now are nuns?
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:23.280]   They just don't want to affiliate with anything religious, let alone Jesus, Christianity.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:29.760]   So I think it's time for us to get uncomfortable, to go out. Doesn't mean we have the answers of
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:34.640]   how to do all of this or how to do everything, but there's this call for us to go out.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:44.320]   Now, how will we do it and what will also this third service look like? Well, in some sense,
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:51.600]   we don't know. We're called Season Uncharted. We have this one piece, young adults, third service,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:57.760]   but how we're going to get there, we don't know. And we actually wanted to also be careful not to
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.800]   put out strategies and plans. And I mean, we were involved in planting this church,
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:10.400]   so we have some ideas of what this could be like. But we felt that we needed to be careful
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:16.880]   and just hold our ideas loosely and just really be open for these things that God opens up.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:23.680]   So we can say yes to them and follow the Holy Spirit's leading and not the old paths and the
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:30.080]   old ways, which maybe that's what God leads us on. But we go there because God leads us on,
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   not because that's where past success was. So church, I'm so excited to step with you guys
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:45.040]   into this uncharted season. I do want to share a little bit of what we can picture. We do picture,
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.320]   obviously, if you're a young adult here, we want to talk to you and hear what is on your heart
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:58.960]   regarding your generation. We want to just hear what excites you about this vision.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:05.920]   We can imagine getting you together like a young adults community, Sunday afternoons,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:11.520]   or something like that. We can imagine running a young adults alpha that's specifically geared
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:18.480]   towards you. And so there's many things that we can imagine, but the only thing that's clear is
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:26.240]   young adults, third service, and then talking to you. So that's the starting point. And then
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:34.320]   we'll take it from there. Now, while that really is our big focus, in addition to that, I do want
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:41.040]   to say that I believe that God will open up some opportunities this year as well that we cannot
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:46.880]   plan for, that we could not even know, but that he wants us to respond to. Maybe it's a third,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.160]   maybe it's another mission partner, an organization that we partner with and that we do incredible
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:57.440]   kingdom work in the city with. And so we also just want to be ready for that as well. I just
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:08.720]   wanted to mention that. Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up. So as we step into this
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.880]   uncharted season, there's going to be things that we do not know yet about that God wants to do in
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:21.760]   and through us. But these things are only going to happen if we are willing to go out, if we're
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:29.120]   willing to sail out on the boat in the uncharted waters. For me, it would be a pity if at the end
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:43.520]   of the year, we all never were uncomfortable for the kingdom's sake. You know, my heart is that
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:51.760]   we're willing to risk, to give God our all, you know, to make ourselves available to him for the
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:57.280]   things that he has for us. Now, this is not a time in Hong Kong's history for the church to be
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.880]   comfortable. There are so many young people who need to be impacted for the sake of the gospel.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:08.640]   And if the church remains in this place of comfort, this will not happen. Come on, church.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:19.280]   Let's do this, right? Yes. Now, because this is a time of calling us in the uncharted waters and
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.800]   being uncomfortable, I'm going to do something that is a little bit uncomfortable for me,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:31.280]   but I'm going to do it anyhow, which is, you know, today is Vision Sunday. So we do ask that you give
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:38.480]   in response to this vision, to this thing that God has revealed to us, you know, for this year.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:47.280]   And there is also a decisiveness that is needed in that. So I want to invite you to prayerfully
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:53.600]   consider what God might be inviting you to give right now. You're giving as an investment
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.000]   in the future of Hong Kong and the future generation of Hong Kong.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:07.600]   You're giving today will allow us to respond to the moves of God. Because like we said,
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.920]   we don't know when this discovery is made. Sometimes we stumble across it. Sometimes we
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:17.680]   find it because we're seeking it out. But when we do, we want to be able to respond and give
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:23.600]   ourselves fully to it. And so one way that we're able to do that is also through finances,
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.080]   you know, that we can respond to the things that we come across. So we want to invite you to give.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:34.240]   We're asking you today to give above and beyond your normal ties,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.480]   to give towards this vision. So we're inviting you now to make an investment in the city
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:46.880]   that you love, that you are planted in through the church that you are in.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:54.320]   And every amount that you give today, it counts. You know, it matters. And the beauty of it is,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:03.040]   is that we get to do this together as a family. We all get to get behind this vision together.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.920]   So I invite you right now to give. I'm going to say a prayer and then Chapman's going to come up.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.440]   He's going to share a few more words after that. So let me pray for us, church. Why don't we stand up?
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.200]   Jesus, we thank you so much
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:37.840]   that you love every single person here in the city, that you long for them to know you.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:44.000]   Jesus, we thank you how you've been so faithful to us, how you've brought us here and all this
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.920]   amazing work that you've done. And we give you praise. Lord, I pray that you give us courage
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.280]   to respond to the moves of your spirit, this courage to get out of our comfort zones.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:08.000]   Then as your kingdom breaks in, as your reign reveals itself, as what you're doing becomes
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   clear, Lord, I pray that you stir excitement in our heart where we can see, wow, that is beautiful.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.640]   I can see this better future. I want to be part of it. Lord, I pray that you give us courage to
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:30.320]   give ourselves to this work that you're doing throughout all of our being, through our serving,
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:39.200]   through our giving. And Lord, may you use it for your glory. May you be honored this year by us,
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:45.760]   your church. And so we thank you that you speak to us. We thank you for this journey that we're
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.080]   I'm with you and I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:49.920]   Amen.
