1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Well, it's the beginning of 2025.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,040
 What I want to do is first actually do a little review of 2024 because God has been amazing.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,440
 He's been so faithful and so good to us.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,520
 And then I'll have a word for us for 2025.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,560
 Now in 2024, we had our one year birthday celebration as a church.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,560
 That was a big deal.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,080
 So praise God for that.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,840
 Yes, very, very subtle.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,880
 We also established a lot of partnerships and collaborations.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,120
 So we had YOM Shanti as one of our mission partners.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,440
 We collaborated with Branches of Hope, which also works with refugees and asylum seekers,

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,240
 with Young Lives, which works with teen moms.

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:57,320
 We've partnered with Oasis Counseling and Psychotherapy Center and some of our parenting

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,920
 workshops, and also through counseling.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,260
 And then we also partnered with a Chinese primary YMCA school in Tianshui, where several

16
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:10,600
 of our Cantonese brothers and sisters, they go twice a week teaching three different classes.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,840
 And so these are ways that we've been getting involved in community and just serving and

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,080
 loving those around us.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,800
 Now another thing that I'm really excited about is that we started a youth group in

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,960
 August 2024.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,840
 And so I already see some of the volunteers sitting here.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,480
 They're amazing.

23
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 And this year, or towards the end of the year, I also asked Francesca and Andrew to actually

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,360
 lead the youth group.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,280
 And so I'm really excited about what God's going to do in 2025 in the youth group.

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,920
 I already saw even just in the month or so that they led it, the energy.

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
 And so I'm excited about what's ahead.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,520
 And I also wanted to ask you, church, to pray for them and pray for our youth ministry.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,800
 So we're really excited about what God is doing there.

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,000
 Then at the beginning of 2024, we shared every year we actually need to grow in giving to

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,440
 cover our expenses, because one child is supporting us.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,720
 And so last year, we were responsible for 20% of our expenses, but we said we need to

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,400
 move towards 40% because guess what, right now we need to cover 40% of our expenses.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
 And we were able to do that.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,240
 So praise God for his financial provision for us and thank you for your generosity and

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,280
 giving.

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,800
 And then we've also experienced incredible growth as a church family.

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,240
 We started off last year with 166 adults and 31 children.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,200
 And in November, we were 251 adults on average between our two services and 61 children.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,040
 So God also has done some incredible work there.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,040
 Yes, praise God.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,160
 And then most importantly, and that's sometimes not that easy to capture, is that people have

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,920
 come to faith.

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,200
 People have grown in faith, have moved from anxiety and fear to faith and trust and have

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,800
 experienced the healing of Jesus through Alpha, through our Sunday services, through community

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,360
 groups, through in K4C our children have experienced as well.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
 And so I just wanted to take the beginning of this year to actually start off with just

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,160
 giving God thanks and praising him for the work that he's done.

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:33,800
 So praise God.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,160
 And I also want to say thank you to you because the way that God works is that he works through

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,500
 his church.

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 He works through his people.

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,960
 And what it actually takes is that people are willing to offer up their time, their

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,840
 talents, their gifts to serve him both inside and outside the church to do his work, to

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,400
 partner in his mission.

56
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,760
 And you guys have done that.

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,720
 And so thank you for faithfully serving as well.

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
 So incredible.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,740
 But right now I'm excited to talk to you about 2025.

60
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,820
 And so today we're kicking off a new sermon series that we've entitled Bold in Prayer.

61
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,800
 So at the beginning of the year, we want to come boldly before God in prayer.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,640
 There's four different prayers we're going to look at from Old Testament, New Testament.

63
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,840
 And I believe those four areas are areas where God wants to do some work in our heart at

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,680
 the beginning of the year to prepare us for what he has for us in 2025.

65
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,520
 So I'm really excited about that.

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,440
 Now we purposefully overlap that with the fasting season.

67
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,840
 And I really do want you to join us in that.

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,320
 So do have a look, do decide on what you're going to fast and what personal things you're

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,760
 going to bring before God.

70
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,920
 Because I believe that when we come to him in prayer, when we come to him in fasting,

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
 you got meets us.

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,560
 You know, he works.

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,360
 And so she would come expectantly as a church, expecting him to move us into his purposes

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,840
 and his destiny and to provide for us what we need in 2025.

75
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,060
 So please do join us for that.

76
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,760
 But now I want to share with you the word that God has impressed on my heart for us

77
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,680
 here at the beginning of the year, which I think will be a theme that will run through

78
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
 all of the year.

79
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,280
 And it started with me walking home from church.

80
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,720
 I was walking home from church.

81
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 I came.

82
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,840
 I was just had just learned the song Holy Forever.

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,240
 I didn't know it before.

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
 So I'm worshiping Holy Forever found on Spotify and put it on repeat.

85
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
 And off I went on my walk back home.

86
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,520
 And so I came to a park and I suddenly sense God asking me to get on my knees and worship

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,520
 him.

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
 I was like, why?

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,220
 There's like there's like people walking here all over the place.

90
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,280
 Why should I get on my knees and worship you?

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,560
 What's what's it about this?

92
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,880
 And I didn't do it.

93
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,080
 So I kept walking.

94
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,880
 And then I even had a stronger sense that God was asking me to get on my knees and to

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,040
 worship him.

96
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,720
 So I got on my knees.

97
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,920
 People walking past me and I worship God in the street.

98
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,360
 Until I felt a release is like, OK, I can get up now.

99
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,960
 But as I was walking, the remainder of time I was walking home, I was like, what was that

100
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
 all about?

101
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
 Like, why?

102
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,520
 Why did I need to get on my knees and worship God in this place?

103
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,580
 Is there something special about this park?

104
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,200
 Is it something about that Jesus doesn't want us to just focus or want me to focus on just

105
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,720
 doing stuff inside this building?

106
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
 But he's telling me that work out in the streets.

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,360
 Like what is it?

108
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,200
 So I was wondering and I'm just walking home like this is kind of bizarre.

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,240
 And by the way, this is not my normal experience.

110
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,920
 I don't constantly have this experience where I feel God speak to me to get on my knees

111
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,520
 and worship him or or something like that.

112
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,080
 Now I also sensed that God was asking me to take a group of people there to worship and

113
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,560
 to pray.

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,280
 Now I have to admit, this also took me a very long time to do.

115
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,640
 But in December, fast forward to December, we finally went there.

116
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,920
 So I invited, I asked Matthias to help me organize it.

117
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:27,160
 And so I went with Matthias and some of you and we went to this park and we worshiped

118
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,960
 God in Cantonese and of course, with Holy Forever, since that was the song where I felt

119
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
 led to worship.

120
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
 I want to show you something.

121
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,760
 I want to show you a photo.

122
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:43,840
 So as we were worshiping and singing Holy Forever, suddenly we had people singing with

123
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
 us and worshiping with us.

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,120
 And it was a group that was like 50 meters or 100 meters away from us was a group of

125
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,640
 Filipino ladies that have their Bible study there.

126
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,720
 And so then we walked over like, let's do this again.

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
 Let's do this the right way.

128
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,000
 So we worship God saying Holy Forever.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,880
 And you know, there's something there's something powerful of just like I have never met these

130
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,500
 ladies before.

131
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,520
 But right away, you know, there's a bond between believers.

132
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,000
 And it was so beautiful.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,920
 And I think we all of us who went, I see some of you here, you know, we were so encouraged

134
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,080
 by that.

135
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,120
 And then we prayed.

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
 We prayed for them.

137
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
 They prayed for us.

138
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,440
 We also went on a prayer walk.

139
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,280
 And I, as we were leaving to go to another park to do some outreach, I there was this

140
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,120
 guy that I had noticed he was sitting there the whole time he's watching us.

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,480
 So I go to the I decided to Jess, Matthias wife had baked some cookies.

142
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,120
 So I brought him some cookies, give him some cookies.

143
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,880
 I wanted to give him a flyer to come to church.

144
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,320
 You don't want the flyer.

145
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,720
 So then I talked to him for like half an hour about God.

146
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,360
 And he's like, Where is your God?

147
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 Show me your God.

148
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
 Introduce me to him.

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,760
 I was like, Oh, it's not that easy that you know, so just he wanted a physical introduction.

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,400
 And and so as we're talking, he's telling me that he is in charge of this park.

151
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,080
 So what does that mean?

152
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,760
 You're in charge of this park.

153
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,400
 It's only tells me more about what he does.

154
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,280
 I was like, Ooh, so it's actually quite dark.

155
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,800
 And it's illegal.

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,960
 And so what we kept talking about God, and I wish I could tell you that at the end, you

157
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,760
 know, he gave his life to Jesus right there.

158
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,660
 And then it hasn't happened yet.

159
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,760
 But I didn't leave him with a challenge.

160
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,960
 I said, You know, you asked me to where's your God?

161
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,680
 I tell you, if you pray, if you say Jesus, reveal yourself, show yourself to me, that

162
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,160
 Jesus will show himself to him.

163
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,160
 And so that's that that's what I left him with.

164
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,140
 Now, stepping back from all of this.

165
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,000
 After some some reflection, I really sensed that this experience that God took me through

166
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,560
 was actually something where he wanted me where he's speaking to me about something

167
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,520
 for all of us.

168
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:16,880
 And it's that this year God wants us to see the people around us with the eyes of Jesus.

169
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:25,200
 And 2025 he is sending us out leading us out into our neighborhoods, into our workplace,

170
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
 into our families.

171
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:33,420
 And he's going to highlight people to us that he wants us to care for, that he wants us

172
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:41,280
 to love and serve, and that he wants us to share the gospel message with.

173
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,760
 But the question is, how do we get started?

174
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,280
 You know, we're here at the beginning of the year.

175
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
 What do we do?

176
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:58,600
 How how can we be filled with the compassion of Jesus and moved to care for those around

177
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,160
 us and share the gospel message with those around us?

178
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,600
 You know, how can we make ourselves available to that and get actually going and not just

179
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,160
 talk about it?

180
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,880
 So that's what I want to explore with you today through this message.

181
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,080
 We're going to go to the gospel of Matthew, to chapter nine.

182
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,400
 The disciples, they've been, to give you a little bit of context, they've been watching

183
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,600
 Jesus teach, they've been observing him ministering to people, healing the sick, driving out demons,

184
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,860
 proclaiming the kingdom.

185
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,060
 And then at the end of chapter nine, the part we're going to look at, there's a transition

186
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,240
 that takes place that I believe is significant for us because I believe this is a transition

187
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,020
 that this year in God's timing, he wants to lead us through.

188
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,800
 And so let me read this passage to you.

189
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,600
 Matthew nine, starting verse 35, it says this.

190
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,200
 Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming

191
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,320
 the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.

192
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:07,040
 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless

193
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,760
 like sheep without a shepherd.

194
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,320
 Then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.

195
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:25,600
 Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out his workers, therefore into the harvest field.

196
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,800
 Then Jesus called his 12 disciples to him and he gave them authority to drive out impure

197
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,960
 spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.

198
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,560
 And then these are the names of the 12 apostles.

199
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,040
 First Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James, son of Zebedee, and

200
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,840
 his brother John, Philip, Bartholomew.

201
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,000
 That one I always have to look up how to say that one.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,200
 Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector, James, son of Aphaius, and Thaddeus, Simon the zealot,

203
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,360
 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

204
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,920
 And these 12 Jesus sent out.

205
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,160
 So there's two things right up front that I think are significant for us as we want

206
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,080
 to open our lives to be filled, to be let out in the compassion of Jesus to those around

207
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,920
 us.

208
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,560
 And that is that Jesus wants to give us eyes to see others with his eyes, with the eyes

209
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,200
 of Jesus.

210
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,560
 And to give us the heart of Jesus for those around us.

211
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,680
 So let me look at verse 36 with you.

212
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,880
 It says this, "When he," so Jesus, "saw the crowd, he had compassion on them, because

213
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,080
 they were harassed, they were helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."

214
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,520
 And Jesus, he uses a metaphor that was quite well known to his contemporaries.

215
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,080
 It was one that you find throughout the Bible of sheep and shepherd Israel.

216
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,400
 The people are the sheep, the shepherds are the leaders.

217
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,760
 And I want to take you to the key, one key passage that I believe is a background to

218
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,440
 what Jesus is observing here.

219
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,920
 And that's in Ezekiel, the prophet Ezekiel.

220
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,840
 He's been given a word that he then declares to Israel and to the leadership.

221
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,960
 And so let me take you to Ezekiel 34.

222
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,760
 We're starting in verse two.

223
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:23,280
 It says this, "Woe to you, shepherds of Israel, who only take care of yourselves.

224
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,600
 Should not shepherds take care of the flock?

225
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,960
 You eat the curds, close yourself with the wool, and slaughter the choice animals.

226
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,640
 But you do not take care of the flock.

227
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,400
 You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured.

228
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,040
 You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost.

229
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,880
 You have ruled over them harshly and brutally.

230
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,040
 So they were scattered because there was no shepherd.

231
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,880
 And when they were scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.

232
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,120
 My sheep wandered all over the mountains and every high hill.

233
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,560
 They scattered them over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them."

234
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
 Wow.

235
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,440
 You know, those are quite some strong words, but they really reveal the heart of God for

236
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
 us.

237
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,920
 You know, "You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured."

238
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,040
 You know, as a church, we're actually meant to pastor people.

239
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,320
 It's not just a pastor who pastors people.

240
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,760
 We're meant to pastor and shepherd people around us.

241
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,760
 It's actually the job of the church.

242
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,880
 The pastor, the wounded, the hurting, the sick, the lost.

243
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,080
 And Jesus is saying, when he observed the crowds, when he has gone through all the towns,

244
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,240
 that this is happening again.

245
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:07,360
 That people are harassed, they are helpless, they lack leadership, they're vulnerable,

246
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,920
 there is pain, there is suffering, there is lostness.

247
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,080
 And that's what Jesus sees when he looks on the crowd.

248
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:24,640
 And I believe one thing that's significant for us is that there's also a spiritual seeing.

249
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,680
 It's not just seeing physically what's happening.

250
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,960
 Now, of course, that's also part of it, and that is also important.

251
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,960
 But Jesus also sees the spiritual condition that people are in.

252
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:44,320
 And he wants us to be people who see with those same eyes those around us.

253
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,440
 He wants to open our eyes this year, to awaken, to not just be...

254
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,400
 I've walked that stretch in Yulong a million times, not a million times, a lot of times,

255
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,520
 be accurate.

256
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,320
 But I never noticed the people in the park.

257
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,520
 And he wants to highlight people to us who are suffering, who are in pain, who are struggling,

258
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,120
 who are lost.

259
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,620
 That really is a start for the work that God wants to do in our hearts.

260
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,200
 He wants to give us eyes to see.

261
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,560
 That's the beginning point.

262
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,600
 Now, but we need to be open for that.

263
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,400
 So then also in verse 36, Jesus, we're told that he had compassion on them.

264
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:39,420
 It's that seeing that then moves to compassion.

265
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,440
 And having compassion is different than having pity.

266
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,080
 Pity is like, "Oh, I'm sorry for you," and you walk on.

267
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,800
 But having compassion means that you do not let you pass by what's going on.

268
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,680
 It means entering the suffering and the pain and the struggles of those around us.

269
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,340
 And it means getting involved and doing something about it.

270
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,080
 That's what compassion is.

271
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,680
 And Jesus allows himself to be filled with compassion.

272
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,680
 He doesn't let the struggles and the pain and the suffering of the people just pass

273
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
 him by.

274
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:30,560
 But he allows himself to be impacted by those who are hurting, those who are lost.

275
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,440
 So Jesus gets involved, and that's what you've been reading in the Gospel of Matthew in chapter,

276
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,400
 especially eight and nine, right before this.

277
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
 Jesus gets involved with people's physical pain, so he heals people.

278
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,160
 Jesus gets involved with people's emotional pain.

279
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:52,080
 He takes away shame and just brings healing to that and restores people and gives them

280
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
 dignity where dignity has been lost.

281
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:04,320
 Jesus gets involved with our spiritual lostness, restores lost sheep back to the sheepfold,

282
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,000
 meaning he brings lost people back to a relationship with the Father and restores them.

283
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,560
 And I love in the Gospel of John, Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd

284
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,640
 lays down his life for the sheep."

285
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 Now, I don't know a deeper way of getting involved than laying down your life, self-giving

286
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:37,640
 love so that people can be restored back to the Father.

287
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:45,680
 He wants us, his people, to be people who practice the same self-giving love, who are

288
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:53,760
 filled with compassion, with the heart of God, moved by love, to not step away from

289
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,360
 people's pain and problems, which a lot of times you don't want to get involved, let's

290
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
 be honest.

291
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,280
 It's like, "Oh, there's pain, let me go a different direction.

292
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,600
 I don't want to deal with whatever this person's going through.

293
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,520
 I don't want to get involved."

294
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,920
 And I'm not saying that we are meant to be involved in everyone, every single person's

295
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,880
 pain, but it will be people's pain and people who are struggling that Jesus wants you to

296
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,680
 be involved in.

297
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,960
 And so the question is, are we available for that?

298
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,960
 Are we willing to go there?

299
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,160
 So Jesus, he does not stay away from our problems and pain, but he draws near to us, and he

300
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,000
 wants us to be people who draw near to others.

301
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And I think this is important for some of us here this morning as well, because actually

302
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,400
 some of us are struggling.

303
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,200
 Some of us are in pain.

304
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,280
 Some of us are hurting.

305
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:50,480
 And you need to know today that Jesus sees you, that he's filled with compassion for

306
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,840
 what is going on, that he's not running away from you like maybe other people in your life

307
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:03,720
 have been doing, but that he is drawing near to you, that he has the power to help you,

308
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,360
 to meet you, to provide you, to get you through.

309
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,560
 And I believe that some of us need to hear this here this morning that are struggling

310
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,240
 and that are hurting.

311
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,560
 And he wants us also to come around those who are hurting and struggling here.

312
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,960
 But Jesus also has compassion for the guy in the park who's doing things that are destroying

313
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,400
 people's lives.

314
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,680
 He's not contributing to flourishing of life, but Jesus has compassion for that person as

315
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,920
 well because he sees his spiritual lostness.

316
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,360
 And he wants that person to also be restored back to the Father for his life to be turned

317
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,840
 around, that instead of bringing people down and destroying people's lives, that this person

318
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,840
 becomes a person who builds people up, who contributes to the good, and who finds life

319
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,920
 in Jesus, forgiveness, and healing, and restoration.

320
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:13,000
 And I just wonder, are we church who wants people like that to come into our service?

321
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,640
 I think that's a real question.

322
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:23,480
 But the heart of the Father longs for the lost sheep, for those who are hurting, those

323
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,680
 who are in pain, to be restored, and he wants us as people to be filled with compassion,

324
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:36,040
 to move out, and to express his love, his care, share his good news with those around

325
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,400
 us.

326
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,800
 So who do you see being harassed and helpless?

327
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:56,920
 Who is the Spirit of God stirring compassion for in your heart?

328
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:06,960
 Who does Jesus want you to see and be filled with compassion for in 2025?

329
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
 Now I notice this is quite heavy, right, because there is a lot of needs.

330
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
 There's a lot of pain.

331
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
 There are a lot of people that are lost.

332
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,600
 There's a lot of people that are hurting.

333
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,200
 And it's really overwhelming.

334
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,600
 But I love that Jesus tells us right away what to do about that.

335
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,880
 And that we see in verse 37 through 38, so let's look at that.

336
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,680
 Jesus says there, "And then he said to his disciples, 'The harvest is plentiful, but

337
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
 the workers are few.

338
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,080
 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out his workers into the harvest field.'"

339
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
 Now I love this.

340
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,880
 Jesus acknowledges this, yes, the harvest is plentiful.

341
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,440
 There are people with needs who are ready to step into the kingdom, but there's a problem

342
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,120
 that the workers are few.

343
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,520
 But in the face of these overwhelming challenges and this lack of resources and lack of workers,

344
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,160
 come and pray to the Lord of the harvest, who has the ability to send out workers into

345
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,640
 his harvest field.

346
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,240
 And it's prayer that propels us forward in responding in a powerful way to the needs

347
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,180
 that we see around us.

348
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,920
 It's the move of the Holy Spirit.

349
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:23,120
 Now as a pastor, honestly, my heart is like, I wish I could force us all to go and do this.

350
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
 I can't.

351
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,680
 And it wouldn't be good.

352
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,440
 It would actually be bad if I tried to do this.

353
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,120
 But it's the Spirit of God moving and stirring in our hearts, moving us into compassion,

354
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:42,880
 giving us eyes to see that sends us out into your workplaces, into your neighborhoods,

355
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:53,160
 into your families to care, to bring his love to bear and to share the gospel message.

356
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:00,440
 Now what I find very significant is that besides the Lord's prayer, this is actually the only

357
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,440
 time where Jesus tells us specifically what to pray for.

358
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,120
 I think this is super significant, that he really is giving his church a word on how

359
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,080
 to pray.

360
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,200
 And he's saying, don't get overwhelmed with the big harvest.

361
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,680
 Don't get overwhelmed with all the needs.

362
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,760
 Don't get overwhelmed with pastoring the people around you that God has put around you and

363
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,920
 has highlighted to you.

364
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,240
 Don't get overwhelmed by that.

365
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,840
 Remember who the Lord of the harvest is.

366
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
 He's the living God.

367
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,200
 He's the God of all resources, all power, all authority.

368
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,980
 And he will provide for his people what we need to do the work he's inviting us into.

369
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,280
 So don't get overwhelmed.

370
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,160
 And he has gone before, he's already at work in the harvest field.

371
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,120
 He's already out there in the streets and in the city and in your family and in your

372
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
 neighbor.

373
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,200
 He's already working.

374
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,080
 He's already drawing people to himself.

375
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:18,560
 But he's waiting for us, his church, to go.

376
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:29,280
 So when we get overwhelmed with these needs, and they are huge, we need to start with prayer.

377
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,180
 We start with prayer.

378
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,780
 And Jesus works through prayer.

379
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,880
 He will provide through prayer.

380
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,620
 He will do a work in our hearts through prayer.

381
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,560
 And when his church prays, we are sent out into the city.

382
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,680
 But it's not just us.

383
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,520
 God will also raise up other workers.

384
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,080
 It's not just that we pray and then he sends us out of the church.

385
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,840
 When we pray for workers to be sent out of the harvest, he will raise up other workers

386
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,680
 that we don't even know about.

387
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,880
 We have visions, we have dreams, we have plans to do kingdom work.

388
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,780
 But he mobilizes people through prayer.

389
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,080
 So we are called to pray.

390
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,480
 Now what I also find fascinating is that the Greek word that Jesus uses when he tells us

391
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,560
 to pray to send out workers, the word send out, ekballo, it's actually a very strong

392
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
 word.

393
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,600
 And here are some of the meanings for it.

394
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,080
 Send out, cast out, flung out, drive out, thrust out.

395
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:38,920
 It's actually the same word that is used for driving out a demon in scripture.

396
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
 Thrust out.

397
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,320
 Now why is that?

398
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,440
 Why is Jesus asking us to pray in such strong language?

399
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,600
 Well here's what I believe.

400
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,680
 I believe that Jesus is asking us to pray that workers are thrust out because we are

401
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,240
 comfortable in our routines and we're living in our comfort zones.

402
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,720
 And we need the spirit of God, the light of fire for us to actually go out.

403
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,920
 To be thrust out, we need a kick in the rear end.

404
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:18,560
 And it happens through prayer, through Holy Spirit moving.

405
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:25,680
 And what's also fascinating with this, this whole part just fascinates me, is that you

406
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,600
 and I, we are Jesus' prayer requests.

407
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,400
 But what do I mean by that?

408
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,000
 Well Jesus does not ask us to pray in this instance for those who are hurting, who are

409
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 out in the street.

410
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,560
 But he actually asks us to pray for the church.

411
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,280
 He asks us to pray for workers to be sent out.

412
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,120
 Have you ever thought about that?

413
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,300
 Like we're Jesus' prayer requests.

414
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,800
 We need prayer.

415
00:28:49,800 --> 00:29:00,080
 Because we need to be thrust out into the harvest field.

416
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,840
 So we're the ones who are stuck in the comfort zone.

417
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,520
 We're the ones who know the gospel.

418
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,760
 We're the ones who know that Jesus changes lives.

419
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:14,800
 But we need the Spirit of God to move us out into the city, into the workplaces, into the

420
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:28,080
 neighborhoods to share the love of Jesus with those around us.

421
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,800
 Now I know that some of you are sitting here, yeah, but it's not me.

422
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,860
 You know, you're talking about these other Christians that like know the Bible and stuff

423
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,360
 really well.

424
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,360
 You're talking about those who have their life in order, who are living very holy and

425
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,280
 pleasing to God lives.

426
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:56,400
 You're talking about the NGO workers or the missionaries or the pastors that do this stuff.

427
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:07,160
 Jesus when he says pray for workers, the word workers in Greek ergates, it means day laborer.

428
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,180
 It's not somebody with special skills.

429
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,520
 It's not somebody with a PhD in biblical languages.

430
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,600
 It's just, it's just a, it's a day laborer.

431
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,100
 So the tasks that we're sent out to do, it doesn't require any special skills.

432
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,440
 We all can do the job.

433
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,960
 You all can do the job.

434
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,640
 We all know how to listen to people.

435
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,560
 We all know how to give people a hug.

436
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,800
 We all know how to invite somebody over for coffee or tea or whatever it is that you drink.

437
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,160
 We all know how to practically help people with the resources that God has given us.

438
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,120
 And we all know how to share about Jesus and the work that he's done in our lives.

439
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,120
 Now we might not say that in the most beautiful way, but you know how to talk about Jesus

440
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,640
 and the work he's done in your life.

441
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,120
 So the most important part is actually willingness and available.

442
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,520
 Are we willing to go out and to be used by God?

443
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,920
 Are we available to God?

444
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,480
 Now a lot of times we focus on the things we don't have.

445
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,240
 I don't have my perfect life left.

446
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,960
 I don't know the Bible perfectly.

447
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,160
 I don't have this, I don't have that.

448
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,600
 But we need to focus on what we have.

449
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,680
 You know, we know how to love.

450
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,800
 We know Jesus.

451
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:40,560
 We have a testimony and we're sent out by the Holy Spirit to do this work.

452
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,480
 And when God sends us, we can do it.

453
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
 And guess what?

454
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,120
 Actually a lot of times you learn on the job.

455
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,200
 You learn by going.

456
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
 So we need to go.

457
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,840
 We're invited to go.

458
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,480
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.

459
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,840
 Now in chapter 10, so moving on in the text, supposedly the disciples, they prayed this

460
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,600
 prayer for God to send out workers.

461
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,400
 And then they are the answer to this prayer because Jesus then sends them out to the lost

462
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,400
 sheep of Israel at this time and to do his work, his healing and restoring work.

463
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,920
 That's interesting there too because there's a transition that takes place in the disciples.

464
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,920
 So first they're referred to as disciples and then suddenly they're referred to as apostles.

465
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,920
 Now apostle, the Greek word literally means sent out messenger.

466
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,040
 Suddenly they become the sent out ones who are sent out into the harvest field that is

467
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,440
 ripe.

468
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,280
 And so they went from bystanders and people observed Jesus, which was okay because that's

469
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:55,320
 what they needed to do at the beginning, to being participants and it was redeeming work

470
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,640
 and healing work.

471
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:05,000
 And I believe that God this year is calling us into this transition of going deeper into

472
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,560
 being participants in his work, in this neighborhood, in the city, in your family, in your workplace,

473
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:21,440
 where he wants to use you to share the gospel message, to bring God's love, to bear in practical

474
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,760
 ways to the people around you.

475
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,760
 But the question is, are we available?

476
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:37,040
 And do we care to see lives restored to Jesus?

477
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,480
 Do we care to see this guy restored in the park to Jesus?

478
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,080
 Do we care to see the coworker restored to Jesus?

479
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,640
 Do we care to see the mom who's maybe overwhelmed with all that's on her plate to restore it

480
00:33:50,640 --> 00:34:01,080
 to Jesus and experience his love and his care from his people, from God's people?

481
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:11,440
 Now as I was thinking about this word and I was picturing and imagining the end of 2020

482
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,680
 to 2025, you know, what do I see?

483
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,320
 What if we all would make ourselves available?

484
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,080
 What if we all pray this prayer and ask Jesus to send us out, to thrust us out into his

485
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
 vineyard?

486
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,800
 What if we actually start doing this work and respond when God highlights somebody,

487
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,400
 we start caring for them and serving them and sharing the good news with them.

488
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:46,320
 And I really believe that if we make ourselves available, that God will do immeasurably more

489
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,760
 than we can ask or imagine.

490
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,120
 That at the end of 2025, we'll have many people in this room, we have been touched by the

491
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,120
 love of Jesus.

492
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,640
 When we communicated about the church plan, one of the things that we said right from

493
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,960
 the beginning is that it is our heart's desire that it is a regular occurrence that people

494
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,080
 are coming to know Jesus.

495
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,800
 I want to see that happening.

496
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,600
 That's my desire.

497
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
 I desire that.

498
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,160
 I long for that.

499
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:34,120
 I want to see people who are hopeless, who are hurting, you know, find hope, find healing.

500
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,760
 So the question is, you know, are we going to pray this prayer to ask the Lord of the

501
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,240
 harvest to send out his workers into the harvest field?

502
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,760
 And then are we, and when he sends us, are we going to be willing to go and do this work?

503
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,480
 Now I actually want us to start off with, with, with praying this prayer.

504
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,200
 So start off this year with praying this prayer that we actually pray what Jesus asked us

505
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
 to pray.

506
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,480
 So I want to invite you to turn to somebody around you to ask them, is it okay if I pray

507
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,480
 with you?

508
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,760
 Maybe somebody, you know, maybe some of you just met, maybe some of you never met, but

509
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,400
 now you're going to talk to them and you just ask them, Hey, can we pray together for this,

510
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,440
 for Jesus to send out workers into the harvest field?

511
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,640
 And then while you're at it, I also want to encourage you if you're, if you want to do

512
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,840
 this, just say, Jesus, this is my heart's desire.

513
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
 I long for this.

514
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
 I'm available.

515
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,840
 Just express that.

516
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,120
 So we're going to take a few minutes to do that and then I'll pray for us.

517
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
 So let's turn to each other right now.

518
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,760
 Let's pray for each other, pray, pray with each other, and then I'll bring us back.

519
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,640
 So let's do this church.

520
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
