[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   I'm so grateful that I can be with you here on my final Sunday with you before sabbatical.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.220]   I was supposed to be preaching out of Ephesians today and continuing our series in Ephesians,
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.760]   and that was the schedule for this Sunday.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.480]   But over the last few weeks as I've just been processing my heart to get ready to go on
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.320]   the four-month break that I have, I've just felt like a rising sense in me that I have
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.720]   a message that I want to impart into you as a community before I go.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.840]   And it's one that I know that the Holy Spirit is currently imparting into me.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.800]   It's something that I feel like the Spirit of God is shaping in me.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.460]   And while this is not always the case, I've recognized over the last 11 years of leading
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.880]   here that when the Holy Spirit does something for me, He'll often also do it for us as a
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.400]   community.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.520]   And so I want to speak a little bit out of what I'm sensing God is calling me into sabbatical
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   for.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.680]   I actually am entering into my sabbatical with a lot of energy.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.800]   I'm not collapsing over the finish line as if I've done this massive marathon and I need
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.240]   someone to kind of pump some sort of energy into me.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320]   I'm actually going on the sabbatical with a lot of spiritual energy, a lot of leadership
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920]   energy, a lot of excitement, which is a great thing.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.760]   But I also recognize I'm heading on the sabbatical because there is some healing I need.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.860]   There is some inner healing and restoration that I need for me.
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.080]   And I know that in order for me to lead how I sense the Holy Spirit is calling me and
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.800]   wanting me to lead here, I need to make sure I've got regular rhythms in my life, not just
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.760]   sabbatical times, but regular rhythms to get healing from the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.640]   But now in this season of my life, I know I need that healing perhaps now more than
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640]   ever.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.240]   And I feel that cool as I go into sabbatical.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.640]   And I want to share a little bit with you today out of that place because I sense that
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.560]   there is many of us here in this room, in the overflow online right now, who are also
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.600]   in need of what we've really seen Paul teach in the book of Ephesians.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.000]   And that is a journey of inner healing and restoration.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.400]   And it's been amazing over the weeks as we've seen Paul's pastoral heart for his church
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   in Ephesus.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.440]   And a few weeks back, we saw that prayer at the end of chapter three, where he says, "My
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.600]   prayer for you is that you would be strengthened with power by the Spirit in your inner being."
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.120]   And it's this pastoral moment where Paul is standing for his church and he's saying, "Man,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.520]   this is my heart.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.280]   My heart is that the Spirit of God would come and do a healing, regenerative, restorative
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.880]   work within you, create power where there is currently weakness."
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.840]   And as I head into my sabbatical, I almost feel like God's got like a little rope around
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.200]   me and he's kind of gently doing this.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.640]   And he's saying, "I need you once again to get strengthened with power by my Spirit in
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.480]   your inner being, because I need to release some things out of you.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.160]   I need to heal and restore some things in you.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.600]   And I feel that call for you here this morning."
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.680]   And so I put aside what I was supposed to be doing and I want to bring a message that
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.760]   hopefully will not only help you to understand what's happening for me, but perhaps more
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.040]   importantly, help you to understand what the Holy Spirit wants to do for you.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.840]   This is a year of intimacy.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.880]   We've said here at the Vine in 2024.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.560]   Intimacy is always not just about coming into closer relationship with Christ or sensing
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.700]   his presence in our lives more.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.280]   Intimacy is always about inner healing and restoration.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.480]   It's always about coming in so that we can be restored to then go out again.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   And I pray that what I share with you today will be a part of that journey in your life.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.200]   A number of months ago, I got a phone call from an old high school friend of mine here
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.800]   in Hong Kong.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.880]   We had been in the same high school year group back in Hong Kong for seven years at South
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.440]   Island School.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.360]   And so we'd kind of grown up together.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.520]   We weren't like the closest of friends in high school, but we were in the same year
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.440]   group and we had both lived in Hong Kong post-graduation.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.720]   And so I had stayed in touch with her here and there and I'd seen her here and there,
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.000]   but her calling me out of the blue was a surprise.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.160]   And so of course I answered the phone.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.120]   And as I was talking to her, she explained to me that the reason why she was calling
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.800]   was because her father had just passed away.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.040]   And she wanted to know whether I would be willing to do the funeral, to help with the
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.720]   funeral, which was of course an incredible privilege to be invited into one of my very
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.520]   old school friends' lives in a time of great grief and mourning to help them to walk into
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.080]   this kind of memorial funeral time.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.720]   And I remember though, as we were talking about this, I remember thinking to myself,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.840]   I don't think this family is from a place of faith.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.680]   Not that that would necessarily stop me from wanting to do this, but I was curious as to
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.660]   why she had asked me to do it.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.000]   And so I raised this, that I thought that they were perhaps a family that were not churched
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.800]   or from the faith tradition.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   And she said, "Yeah, absolutely."
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.680]   And she said, "In fact, my father was a staunch atheist, a strong atheist for the majority
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   of his life.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.920]   And one of the things that he loved to do most at the end of his life, in the last few
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.000]   years of his life, is to debate with Christians to prove them that they're stupid in their
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.720]   beliefs.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.240]   And you want me to do the memorial, right?"
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.880]   So this is kind of an interesting context, right?
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.000]   But I sensed her heart.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.300]   She didn't know anybody in church.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.400]   She didn't know really many Christians in her life, but she remembered me, that I was
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   a pastor.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.600]   And she gave me a call and said, "Hey, I would love you to do this."
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.520]   And of course, I was like, "Absolutely.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.080]   I would love to serve you and your family at this time of grief."
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.080]   She said, "Great.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.520]   Well, maybe in a couple of weeks' time, we can meet face to face just a few days before
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   the funeral, and we can firm up the rundown and everything like that."
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.640]   And I'm like, "Yep, great."
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:59.240]   So two weeks later, we met here at the Vine, and something absolutely fascinating had occurred
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.780]   between that first phone call and meeting her here in the building.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.640]   Her father had been raised from the dead.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.720]   No, that's a lie.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   I just made that up.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   That didn't happen.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.560]   I just wanted to see how you would react.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   I'm going on sabbatical.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.360]   I can play with you a little bit.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.240]   That's fine.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.240]   But no, but something fascinating had happened.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.120]   So in that two weeks between when I had first spoken to her and we met, she'd been going
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.680]   through her father's possessions, and she had discovered in the possessions a handwritten
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   note.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.360]   And because of the way it was written and the date on the back, she knew that he had
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.280]   written it just a month before he had passed away.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   Now it was rare for him to write anything down, particularly to write a handwritten
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.800]   kind of note like this.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.440]   And when she looked at it, even though she's not from a faith background, she thought that
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.720]   what she was reading was potentially a quote from the Bible.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.080]   And so she showed it to me as we met, and I want to show you a photo of it.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.560]   I took a photo of it here, and it's from 1 Chronicles 4.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.960]   Let me read this to you.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.080]   "Oh, that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory, that your hand would be with
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.800]   me and that you would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain."
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.940]   So I read this note, and although I've been a pastor for many years, and although I would
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.360]   say I probably have an above-average understanding of the Bible and its narrative, I really didn't
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.200]   recognize this prayer.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.000]   I wonder if any of you in the room recognize it.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.960]   If you did, well done.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.120]   I did not.
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.000]   So I had actually opened my Bible and go into the Bible, and then I realized, "Ah, this
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.480]   is the famous Prayer of Jabez."
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.440]   Has anyone ever heard of the Prayer of Jabez before?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.680]   If you're older here, chances are you have, because this little prayer was actually made
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.880]   famous about 24 years ago when Bruce Wilkinson, a pastor, wrote a short little book called
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.200]   The Prayer of Jabez.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.800]   And in the intro of the book, he actually said this.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.620]   He said, "If you pray this prayer once a day for 30 days, then you can expect that God
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.040]   is going to bless you, He's going to enlarge your territory, He's going to enable you to
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.400]   have more influence."
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.560]   And this book sold like wildfire.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.640]   Because let's face it, all of us want that magical prayer, don't we?
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.240]   That one thing that we could pray, if we could pray that 30 days, my whole life would be
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.880]   changed and I would have more influence and more power and more material goods, and God
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.880]   has blessed me.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.960]   And this was the classic kind of name it and claim it book, and it flew off the shelves.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:46.260]   In fact, to this day, it remains one of the only five Christian books that have sold more
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.720]   than 10 million copies in the US alone.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.160]   Go into any church, go into pretty much any Christian bookstore anywhere in the world,
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.920]   you will see a copy of this book, The Prayer of Jabez.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:04.420]   Now, it is possible that my friend's father stumbled across that book in the last month
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:11.200]   of his life, read it, and decided to hand write out that prayer, but I don't think that's
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   what happened.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.160]   In fact, the reason why I don't think that happened is because of the translation in
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.040]   which he writes out this prayer in his own hand.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.080]   It's not the translation that Bruce uses in the book.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:27.120]   In fact, I think it's much more likely that my friend's father recalled this prayer from
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.960]   an early time in his life.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.280]   He was Dutch and had been raised within the Dutch community before moving to Hong Kong
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.740]   later in his life, so it's possible that he might have heard this in the school or something
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:46.480]   like that, and in his last dying few weeks, recalls the prayer and decides to write it
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.400]   out in hand.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.560]   And as my friend gave me the note, she said, "I would love it if you could speak on this
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.240]   passage at the memorial," and that led me into a time of researching a bit about it,
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:05.000]   looking at the scriptures, understanding the passage, and as I did so, not only did I become
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.640]   more profoundly fascinated and honoring of her father, I also realized that God had something
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.040]   deep to say to me.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.240]   And as I open this up for you here today, I wonder, and I hope and pray, that I'll have
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.160]   something deep to say to you too.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.680]   Prayer of Jabez is just two verses in the Bible.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.840]   He's only mentioned in those two verses.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.120]   It's found in the middle of eight chapters of genealogy at the beginning of 1 Chronicles.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.840]   I don't know if you've read 1 Chronicles much lately.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.800]   It's the story, basically, of Israel and their journey up into the Davidic kingdom, and it
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.280]   traces in the first eight chapters this genealogy of all the kings and all the tribes, starting
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.400]   with Adam going to Abraham, and then the 12 tribes, and it unpacks all the descendants,
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.680]   the generations, flowing out of the kings of those 12.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.320]   Now here in chapter 4, where these two verses are found, it's actually found in the tribe
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   of Judah.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.880]   So Jabez is part of the family of the kings from the tribe of Judah, which tells us something
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.020]   straight away, that Jabez was from a privileged background.
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:19.200]   He was a son of one of the kings in the generation in the line of Judah.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.800]   He was probably raised in a place of relative prosperity and wealth.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.240]   And I want to read you the two verses that we have that captures his story.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.800]   This is 1 Chronicles 4, starting in verse 9.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.880]   "Jabez was more honorable than his brothers.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.360]   His mother had named him Jabez, saying, 'I gave birth to him in pain.'
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.040]   Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, 'Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.320]   Let your hand be with me and keep me from harm, so that I will be free from pain.'
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.680]   And God granted his request."
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.160]   Just two verses in the middle of a genealogy.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.920]   If you're anything like me, when you come across the genealogies in the Bible, you're
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920]   like...
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:04.080]   But right in the middle of that, we see this fascinating story.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.640]   And the first thing we learn is what his mother has gone through and what she does in response.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.920]   Here's the fascinating thing.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:16.680]   We all respond in challenging ways when we've experienced trauma.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.400]   She names her son Jabez, it says here.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.560]   "For I gave birth to him in pain."
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:29.360]   The name Jabez, literally in the Hebrew, sounds like the Hebrew word for pain.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.440]   His mother, and we don't know the details because we're not given any more details than
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.380]   this, but we can assume that her mother had a really bad labor with Jabez.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.840]   So bad that the pain and the time and everything that happened, maybe she even almost died,
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   we don't know.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.960]   But there was so much pain that when Jabez was born, and it was her responsibility to
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.280]   speak a name, to place a name on him, all she could think of out of her trauma was,
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.720]   "This one caused pain."
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.720]   That's what his name means.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.560]   "This one caused pain."
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:12.520]   And so for the rest of Jabez's life, he's named, he's called the one that causes pain.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.520]   Which shouldn't have happened because when you're a part of a royal family, when you're
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.800]   a part of the lineage of the kings, your name that you're given at birth is very important,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.320]   particularly in Hebrew culture.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.460]   And so probably he should have been named for one of his forefathers.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.020]   Or perhaps he could be named for a village or an area where a great battle or victory
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.900]   happened in the generations of his family.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.600]   Or maybe at the very least, he should have been given a name that would actually help
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.980]   to project this idea of a character or something that God wants to do in his life or something
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.620]   that his parents are longing for.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:51.780]   Instead, out of this woman's deep pain of childbirth, she places her hand on her son
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.340]   and she says, "This one caused pain."
[00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:00.500]   And Jabez for the rest of his life is causer of pain.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:10.840]   The names and the words and the labels placed over us in life hurt us, don't they?
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.000]   We don't know the details here, but we can assume that Jabez grew up in a place of embarrassment
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.540]   and shame because of this name.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.640]   Surrounded by brothers who probably had much more regal and better names, he's constantly,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.360]   anytime he's called, anytime somebody says his name, anytime he has to introduce himself,
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.440]   "Hi, I'm causer of pain."
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:41.100]   It's fascinating to me because in the Hebrew understanding of naming something, in the
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.740]   Hebrew worldview of the Old Testament, they thought that names had materialism to them.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.820]   In other words, when you put a name on someone, it was like you were actually literally physically
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.600]   placing a mantle on them.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.560]   The word "dabah," which is the Hebrew word for "word," when you speak a word, the word
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.340]   suggests a putting on of, almost like you're putting a cloak on somebody.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:08.280]   A little bit like how Ezekiel would get a cloak put on him as a prophet.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.320]   When we speak a name in the Old Testament Hebrew understanding, it's a physicality to
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.560]   it, a weight to it.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.200]   This is why in the modern days, you remember if somebody says to you, "Oh man, their words
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   had weight."
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.000]   Remember how we say that?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.520]   That's basically the Old Testament Hebrew understanding of this idea of what naming
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.520]   something is.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.440]   So when his mother does this to him, she knows what she's doing.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.720]   And she's placing upon him, in her mind, a material reality.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.900]   Not just saying something with an arbitrary meaning, she's placing a material reality
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.580]   on them out of the depth of her trauma, she causes trauma.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.540]   She's not the first person to have done it in history.
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.980]   She will not be the last.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:57.660]   And Jabez now has to walk in the pain of the reality of this name, shaping his identity,
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:04.700]   shaping how he introduces himself, and how he now lives out his life.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:12.780]   And you can almost sense that for Jabez, he's rooted now in a story that he does not want,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.420]   but a story he's not sure how he can get out of.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.660]   I wonder if anyone else feels that way here.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:23.900]   I wonder if anyone else has ever said something over you, spoken a name over you, labeled
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:31.300]   you in some way that has caused you to live a story you're struggling to get out of.
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:40.900]   When I was 14 years old, my chemistry teacher at school told me that I would never amount
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.900]   to anything.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.180]   His actual words were this, "Andrew, you are a failure.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.420]   Keep this up and you'll never amount to anything in life."
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:55.700]   I remember that moment vividly, as if it happened literally just yesterday.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.540]   I remember where I was, I remember the smell of the room, I remember what he was wearing,
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.660]   I remember what I was wearing.
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.860]   And although I didn't like this person particularly very much, and he was right, I was failing
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:12.860]   in chemistry, there was something as a 14-year-old that a person in authority said over me, "I
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.780]   will never amount to anything."
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:22.060]   And although, of course, neither of us were Jewish, there was this impact to me.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:29.240]   That phrase, those words went deep into a 14-year-old that was trying to build his identity.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.300]   And I think to begin with, it was at the subconscious level.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.260]   This kind of subconscious level that maybe I'm not going to amount to anything, that
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.920]   maybe my life's not going to mean much.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:45.180]   And then when I became a young adult and started to work and move into adult life, it wasn't
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.580]   subconscious anymore, it became a conscious reality to me.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.620]   And I have sat under the power of those words for all of my adult life.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.380]   The one thing I have struggled the most with, and I've shared this quite a bit with you
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.180]   as a church over the years, is insecurities.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.820]   Insecurities about my self-worth, insecurities about whether I'm achieving anything or doing
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.820]   anything.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.380]   I've struggled a lot in my adult life with imposter syndrome, and I can trace it all
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.900]   back to that moment where he has spoken over me.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.820]   And I've realized over the years that those words have done two things, and I wonder whether
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.900]   this might resonate with some of you who know some words that have been spoken over you.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:31.100]   Those words have crippled me at times, and they have driven me at times.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:37.300]   On the crippled side, those words have sucked confidence out of me, sucked self-belief,
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.540]   and I've struggled with self-doubt for so much of my life.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.260]   In fact, I can't even tell you, Chris was here for the first service, my wife, but I
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.260]   can't tell you the number of Sundays where no matter how many people showed up, no matter
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.500]   how buzzing the worship was, no matter how perhaps impactful maybe the word was, I get
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.820]   home and I crawl up onto the couch and I feel terrible.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.380]   I feel like nothing really happened.
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.380]   Nobody really responded.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.580]   It wasn't that great of a Sunday.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.420]   Oh, why do I even bother doing this?
[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.780]   It's like I'm pushing water uphill, I'm not achieving it, and I'll spiral because I'm
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:16.660]   tired and I'm worn out, and I'm entering into some of those deeper places that I have where
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.540]   there's a brokenness within me because somebody said at the age of 14, "You're never going
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.980]   to amount to anything," and that has so crippled me that even to this day, I still have days,
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:31.240]   it's not every day, okay, but some days where I feel stripped and drained of the confidence
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.280]   that I should have as a son of Christ.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.240]   On other days, those words have driven me.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.220]   They've gotten inside of me and they've made me want to push even harder to prove that
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.900]   those words are wrong.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:50.260]   And out of the exhaustion of performance and perfectionism, I've tried to create something
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.300]   that perhaps wasn't there, and I've tried to work really hard because I'm trying to
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:59.060]   prove first of all to God, then to myself, then to my family, and then to you all that
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.420]   actually I have achieved something with my life.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.800]   I'm turning 50 next year, and if you're over the age of 50 right here, you can close your
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.360]   ears right now, but that's really old.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.320]   And I feel really old.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.080]   And I kid you not, I'm having like a midlife crisis, part of the reason why I need to get
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.080]   on sabbatical.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.600]   And I'm having a midlife crisis, this is my midlife crisis.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.320]   I'm almost dead and I haven't achieved anything.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.980]   And I kind of say it as a joke, but the reality is deep inside, that is partly how I reflect
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.840]   about myself.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:37.800]   I know that I have been weighed down by the materialistic impact of somebody's words.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.920]   And how about for you?
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.280]   What has been spoken over you in your life?
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.800]   Perhaps for some of you, it was by somebody who loves you deeply and meant well for you.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.360]   Maybe a parent who said something maybe out of place of love, but those words, man, were
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.760]   not what you needed to hear.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.720]   And you've carried those words with you and they've shaped and changed you in some way.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.940]   Perhaps like me, it was a teacher, somebody that you looked up to, an authority figure
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.940]   in your life.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.840]   Perhaps it was a pastor, someone like that.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.120]   But somebody has said something and it's changed you and it's hurt you.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.840]   And it's actually over time begun to shape how you think about the world and how you
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.620]   think about yourself.
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.240]   And now you feel like you're under the weight of those words and it's really hard for you
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.840]   to break out of the weight of those words.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:33.480]   What names or words do you struggle to be free from?
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:39.360]   Jabez struggled to be free from the word that had been placed over him.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.600]   But at some point in his life, he decided to draw a line in the sand.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.120]   We don't know when.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.580]   All we get is the naming of him and the impact that had for him.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.880]   And then we get his prayer.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.680]   At some point though, whether it was when he was still young, probably more likely as
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.520]   he got a little bit older, he decided to draw the line in the sand and take action against
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.200]   the thing that had been placed upon him.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   And for him, that action, not to hate his mom and his action is to go to God and ask
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.360]   for healing.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   It's beautiful.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.480]   This is why it says at the beginning of the passage, he was more honorable than his brothers,
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.520]   because he has a heart inside of him to not try to fix things himself.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.000]   He's got a heart inside him to realize the only way I can be lifted from the power that
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.020]   this name is placed upon me is by bringing it to God and getting healing and restoration
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.020]   from him.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:32.560]   He's honorable in his humility to bring action to what has been happening.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.600]   And I want you to see what it says right at the start of verse 10.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.760]   It says, "Jabez cried out."
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.000]   The Hebrew word here for cried out doesn't mean like just praised.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.920]   It means from a place of anguish.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:50.320]   He kind of speaks loudly before God from a place of pain, basically, which is really
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.080]   ironic because the writer here is trying to help you to see a journey.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:00.220]   Jabez, the one who is named causer of pain, is in pain himself.
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.600]   And his pain is because his mom has caused him pain, which is ironic.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.360]   She said, "You're the causer of pain," but she's the one who ends up causing him pain.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.960]   And in that place of great pain, not health, not great, in a place of pain, he then cries
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   out.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.960]   I want you to see how he cries out.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:24.760]   He says, first of all, "Bless me, O that you would bless me and enlarge my territory."
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.840]   Remember the context.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.480]   The context is he's a son of a king.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.120]   He's grown up in the royal household.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.760]   He's had privilege from the very beginning of his life.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.960]   He's not crying out to ask God to bless him materially.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.000]   He's calling out and asking God to meet him in the pain and the brokenness of the label
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.520]   that has been placed upon him.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.160]   And in that, he says, "Would you bless me?"
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.760]   In other words, "Would you turn your face to me?
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.920]   Would your presence be here for me?"
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.280]   This is not a prayer for prosperity.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.760]   It's a prayer for presence.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:02.960]   God, I need you to be with me because I can't do this anymore, and I'm crushed by the weight
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.840]   of the word, the name that has been placed upon me.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.720]   This is why he says, "Enlarge my territory."
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.560]   He's not asking for his kingdom to grow.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.800]   He's not asking that he would have more influence in the world and fight bigger battles and
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.100]   get bigger influence and get that promotion.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.520]   This is not some materialistic desire.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.800]   What he's realizing is because the name has been placed over him that says, "You're a
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.160]   causer of pain," it has shrunk his worldview.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.000]   It has shrunk how he sees himself.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.880]   And he doesn't see himself how he should be seeing himself, and he's seeing much smaller
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   than he should.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.760]   And so he comes to God and says, "Turn your countenance, your presence.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.760]   Bless me."
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.920]   Always about God's presence, primarily in the Old Testament.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.480]   "Would you bless me with your presence so that I can have a bigger view of life, a bigger
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.000]   view of myself?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.720]   Enlarge the territory.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.800]   Enlarge my way of thinking, my spirit, because I have been crushed."
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.880]   And that's what trauma will always do.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:06.160]   Trauma and names spoken over you will always strip away a big vision and always try to
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.120]   reduce you.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.440]   Like for me, I'm never going to amount to anything, so why even bother to try?
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:22.760]   Javis says, "Enlarge my territory because I realize that I have shrunk my identity down
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.880]   to the power of the word that was put over me."
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.960]   Which is why he then says, "May your hand be upon me."
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:35.040]   In Hebrews, in the present continuous tense, which basically means every single day, now
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.540]   and forevermore, I need your hand to be with me.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.780]   He's asking for the soles of the feet, not just the king, which is to bless me, enlarge
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.780]   my territory.
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.880]   He's saying, "I need you to put your hand upon me every day.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.480]   I want you to be alongside of me, walking with me.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.560]   The soles of your feet, if you will," is how Ezekiel would say it.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.280]   "The soles of your feet be with me.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.960]   I need your hand.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.640]   The hand that is powerful, that can fight battles, that can break chains," because
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.320]   Javis realizes there's chains on his heart and he's hurting.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.480]   He's saying, "God, would you break the chain?
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.280]   Would your hand every single day help me in my journey?"
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.760]   Then he gets to the crux of his prayer and he prays this.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:24.040]   He says, "And keep me from harm so that I may be free from pain."
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.640]   This little bit right here, "that I may be free from pain," is what's called by scholars
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.280]   a textual variance in the Hebrew.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.240]   What that means is that there are various different documents where we drive 1 Chronicles
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.040]   from that have words here that are slightly different.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.080]   There are two ways of interpreting, looking at the textual variances, what he's saying
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   here.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.280]   One is the way it's shown in the NIV, that I would be free from pain, which seems a very
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.640]   important thing because he's just told us he's cried out in pain.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.960]   It makes sense at the end of his prayer he would say, "I want to be free from pain."
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.040]   I think that's a good prayer.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:04.120]   But as I've studied this text and as I've looked at the documents by which this is drawing
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.360]   from, I think the way this is captured in other translations is actually closer to what
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.280]   was originally intended in the Hebrew.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.680]   You can see this, for example, in the New King James Version.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.440]   Let me put both side by side.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.080]   So NIV on the left, "so that I will be free from pain."
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.920]   And NKJV interprets this way, "that I may not cause pain."
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.680]   And I want you to absorb in your spirit here what Jabez is doing.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.640]   I think this is much more textually accurate to what I think Jabez actually prayed.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.420]   And as it comes out in the Hebrew, he's not saying that I would be free from pain.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.840]   He was saying, "so that I don't cause pain anymore."
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.080]   What he's saying is, "I don't want to be the name anymore.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:48.520]   If my name is causer of pain, here is my prayer, that I would not live up to the label that's
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.480]   been placed on me.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.400]   That I need your freedom to bring me out from the label that has been put on me.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.040]   I will not be my name.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.440]   And I need you every single day to bless me, bring your presence towards me.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.920]   I need you to enlarge how I see myself, because I'm not seeing myself properly right now.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.160]   And I need you so that I would not cause pain.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.560]   So I'm not going to take the name that has been put on me and allow that to shape who
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   I am.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.400]   No, Lord, I'm going to speak in the opposite spirit in this prayer.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.200]   And I'm going to ask you, Lord, release me, release me, release me, that I would no longer
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.600]   my narrative and my story would not be to cause pain.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:31.840]   My name may stay, remained Jabez, but my narrative will not be linked to my name.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:39.560]   That I may be free from pain, yes, but that I may not cause the pain of others.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:47.360]   I will not be the label my mother put on me.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.760]   Let me paraphrase how I think he's expressing the prayer.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.080]   My mother named me as one who causes pain and I have carried this label around with
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.960]   me my whole life, but no more.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   God come and bless me.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.160]   Help me to enlarge the territory of my identity so I do not live out the very name that was
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   placed upon me.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.000]   I don't want to be what my name suggests.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.840]   No, Lord, bless me, change me so that I would not cause pain.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.100]   This is not a prayer for prosperity.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.460]   This is a prayer for inner healing.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:22.020]   This is a prayer for freedom from the name that was placed upon him.
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.920]   That's the prayer of Jabez, my friends.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:33.600]   What fascinates me is that my friend's father, who wrote out this prayer in hand, wrote out
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.800]   what I would consider is the right translation of it.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   Let me show you once again what he wrote at the end, that I may not cause pain.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.680]   It's interesting.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.440]   I was talking to my friend about him and his journey in life and she told me great stories
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.520]   because I was going to have to represent him at the memorial.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520]   She told me lots of great stories.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.000]   This man had lived an amazing life.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   He was a person who was a large in the life character that really grabbed life by its
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   neck and lived out that idea of better to burn out than fade away.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.600]   He was just full on in his life.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   He was an entrepreneur.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.400]   He actually lived in Hong Kong the majority of his life and he had changed and done a
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.280]   lot of great things for Hong Kong as a city.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.760]   But she also shared stories of some of his challenges and some of the things that he
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.700]   hadn't done well, like all of us here who don't always live the perfect life.
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.000]   He had had brokenness in his marriage.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.440]   He had found himself in divorce.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.960]   He had brokenness in his finances and what happened in his finances that actually ended
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.440]   up causing quite a lot of pain, pain to himself and pain to his family.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.400]   I think it's so profound that just a few weeks before he passed, he would write out in hand
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.000]   this old prayer that he remembered from when he was a kid and right at the end of it, he
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.320]   would say, "So that I may not cause pain."
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.560]   I don't know whether he gave his life to Jesus at the end of his life or not.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.760]   We have no idea of knowing that, but what I do know is that somehow he found comfort
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:06.320]   in an old prayer and he could use it to express something to his daughter who found the note,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:11.080]   "I never wanted to cause you pain and I'm sorry for anything that I've done that may
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.560]   have caused you pain, that I may not cause pain."
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:21.400]   As I step on the sabbatical tonight, I do so because I'm in need of my version of the
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.720]   prayer of Jabez.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:29.680]   I realize that as a 14-year-old, I was spoken over in a way that has impacted my life and
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.360]   my insecurities and how I see myself.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.440]   And it's not the first time that I've recognized this.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.480]   I've had years of therapy and prayer and it's helped hugely.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.000]   I've had so many victories and I know standing before you today, I'm way stronger than I
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.720]   ever used to be, but I realize I desire more.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.320]   I realize that there's more freedom I want.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.200]   I realize that I do not want to carry around any more, even just a little bit of what that
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.480]   man said to me when I was 14 years old.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:05.880]   So part of my need for sabbatical is to get away and pray a prayer that ends with that
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:13.360]   I would do what it is that you called me to do and never second guess it.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   That's going to be a journey.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.920]   It's not going to be an easy thing to do and that's what my sabbatical is about.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.800]   How about for you?
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.800]   In this year of intimacy here at the Vine, what an opportunity we have to a journey of
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   inner healing.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:31.520]   And there have been some words and some names that either have been spoken over you, that
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.320]   you know you struggle to be free from, or that, and we felt this at the end of the first
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:44.200]   service, or that you've spoken over yourself, ways that you've come to define yourself or
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.960]   maybe out of your own traumas or your own past experiences, and you've labeled yourself
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.600]   a certain way that actually Christ looks over you and says, "That's not who I created you
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.400]   to be," or, "That's not who you are.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.920]   There's so much more in you.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.160]   You're not a failure as you are currently defining yourself.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.640]   You're not one who can't be loved as you're currently saying about yourself.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:11.360]   You're not one who has been rejected or lonely as you think right now about yourself.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.840]   The names we place over ourselves have such awesome depth to hold us captive."
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   So whether somebody has said something to you or you know you've said something to yourself,
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.200]   either way you know that there's change, you know that there's hurt, you know that there's
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.480]   a need for freedom and healing.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.160]   That's what my sabbatical is going to be about, but I also pray that that's what this is about
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.600]   for you too.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.760]   I want to encourage you to just open your heart.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:45.080]   I thought for some of you here, words spoken over you, and you're like Jabez, you're like,
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   "Enough is enough.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.520]   They've crippled me and they've driven me.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   I'm going to come.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.920]   Lord, would you bless me?
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.280]   Would you enlarge the places that I have made small?
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.160]   Would you be with me every day because I need you every day in this?
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.600]   And would you enable me to walk in the opposite spirit of the name that has been spoken of
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.600]   me?
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600]   I will not accept it anymore."
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:13.360]   And I pray as you do that, you will see freedom in your life like never before.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.360]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.280]   Maybe we could just close our eyes and bow our heads.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.280]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.840]   I want to lead you in a ministry moment here.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:29.480]   If this has been speaking to you and if this resonates with you, in a moment I'm going
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.960]   to invite you just to respond by opening your hands.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.520]   And opening your hands is just a subtle way of coming before the Lord here this morning
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.760]   and saying, "I need this too.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.000]   I need my version of the prayer of Jabez.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.600]   I need inner healing from some of the things that have been spoken over me and I'm tired.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.560]   I don't want to carry it around with me anymore.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.720]   Or I need freedom from the things that I've been saying about myself.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:02.680]   One of the things that I know in my life, I've been saying I'm old a lot lately.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   And honestly I felt convicted by the Holy Spirit this morning because in the view of
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:12.600]   eternity I'm really, really, really, really, really, really young in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.240]   I need to stop cursing myself by saying I'm old.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.120]   And I cut that off right now in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.680]   Forgive me Lord.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.280]   So Lord, any words that people in this room have spoken over themselves that are not of
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   you, Lord, we want to bring those to you too.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:37.840]   So this is for you, maybe just you can open your hands as you're sat and I want to pray.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.320]   Father, we are very grateful that we have your presence with us.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:49.280]   We're very grateful that, yeah, through the story of a man who would claim to be an atheist,
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:55.360]   we have an entry point into understanding a prayer that perhaps has been misunderstood
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.080]   for too long.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.520]   And Father, I know that there is a lot that the enemy has done over us and over individuals
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.320]   here in this room over years.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.080]   Lord, I know that there are people in this room who have carried and are carrying the
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:13.800]   wrong identity or the wrong thought about themselves simply because somebody has labeled
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   them.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.600]   And you need to know here this morning, you are not your label.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.440]   I'm going to say that again in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.680]   You are not your label.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.080]   You are not that name.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.480]   You are not that word.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:29.400]   You are not the label that has been placed upon you.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.920]   You are exactly who God says you are.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.120]   And you are alive in Christ.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:41.040]   And Christ looks at you as a child of His.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.200]   And He says, "You are just as I have created you to be.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:52.800]   And that there is nothing, nothing that I cannot liberate you from."
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.880]   So Lord, we come to you with our hands open and with the recognition of perhaps for some
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.600]   of us years of hurt and pain.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.640]   Lord, we want to pray first of all for your presence.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.600]   Come Holy Spirit, come.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.720]   I want to pray that that starting of the Jabez prayer would be for each person here.
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   Come and bless me.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.760]   Turn your face towards me.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.120]   Maybe that can just be if your hands are open.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.360]   That can be the starting point of this prayer right now.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.080]   Just come before the Holy Spirit and say, "Lord, would you turn your face to me?
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.080]   Would your presence be here?"
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.480]   It's not like you have to convince Him to do that.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.960]   Of course He's present with you.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.440]   But just in asking Him to bless you, it's an opening of your heart.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.680]   That's the starting point of walking in the opposite spirit.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.280]   "Lord, I ask that you would bless me.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.880]   I believe that I'm a person who deserves your blessing."
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.760]   For some of you, that's a breakthrough right then.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.360]   I sense that as I'm praying.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.840]   This is a breakthrough right now in the spirit.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.640]   Just you saying, "Lord, bless me," is a massive breakthrough for you because you didn't think
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.760]   you were worthy of His blessings.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.440]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.040]   I want to encourage you for you now.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.240]   As you've asked God to turn His countenance and His presence towards you, here's your
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.240]   next prayer.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.040]   "Lord, enlarge my territory."
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.480]   Maybe just bring what it is that you know you're carrying, the smallness perhaps, the
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.840]   shrinking of your identity.
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:19.640]   Yeah, whatever it is that has caused you to think less of yourself.
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.160]   Not to have big dreams, but small dreams because you don't think you deserve it or you don't
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.440]   think you're good enough.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.120]   And you've reduced the sphere of your influence.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.240]   I want to pray that you would have the faith and the courage to say, "Lord, would you enlarge
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.240]   my territory?
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.800]   Enlarge my spirit?
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.360]   Enlarge my emotions?
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:45.120]   Enlarge the way that I think about myself?"
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.920]   Then I want you to pray, "Lord, would you be with me every day?
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.520]   Father, not just in this moment where it feels good and safe and right, but Lord, tomorrow
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.400]   morning when I wake up and the kids are crying and I've got to rush to work and it's going
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.680]   to be crazy and I would have forgotten everything that happened on Sunday.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.000]   And Lord, in that moment, would you be with me even more powerfully than you're with me
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   in this moment?
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.520]   Lord, I need you every day.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.440]   I need you to be my strong right arm, my strong and mighty tower.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.840]   Your name, not mine, your name would be my rear guard, my yesterday, today and forever."
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:28.240]   And in that courage that you've already had, here's the final part of the prayer.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.080]   For Jabez, it was, "Man, somebody put a name over me that I'm one who causes pain, so here's
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   my prayer.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.440]   Lord, help me not to cause pain."
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.080]   For you, if somebody has said to you, "You're not good enough," here's your prayer today,
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.840]   "Lord, help me to know that I am good enough."
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:50.160]   Or perhaps even stronger than that, you say, "Lord, I declare that I am good enough."
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:55.280]   If someone's told you, "You're not lovable," here's your reply, "Lord, I am lovable.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.680]   I am the apple of your eye.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.840]   I believe I'm worthy of being loved."
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.040]   So whatever is the opposite of whatever that name is that's been placed over you, that's
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   your prayer of Jabez, and that's your opportunity to come now, just in the quietness of your
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.600]   heart, go, "Lord, this for me.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.600]   I will not accept what it is that's been said, and I move now in the opposite spirit, and
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.480]   I release, Lord, and I say the opposite of what has been labeled me.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.840]   I am not my label.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.320]   I am this as a child of God.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.160]   I am this as a child of Christ, and Christ has paid the price on the cross for all of
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:37.160]   the brokenness that I seem to be carrying with me, and Lord, would you bring liberation.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.160]   Liberation.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   Holy Spirit."
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:41:00.120]   I was going to invite in a second the worship team just to just lead us, but I want to,
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.800]   I want to ask you just to stay in a place of receiving.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   This is for you today.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   We're going to have the prayer team.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:11.040]   In fact, maybe I could just invite the prayer team just to be at the front already, our
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.840]   altar call prayer team, and I want to encourage you.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   This is really important for you today.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.640]   Don't leave here today without getting prayer.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.160]   As much as it's been good for us to go through this as a community, but there's some individual
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.200]   things that we would love to pray for you about, and there's some of you here where,
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.520]   you know, just having someone come around you, lay their hands on you, speak truth into
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.560]   you, both in the upper house and the lower house.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.040]   If you're outside, you can come in in a moment.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.520]   We would love to stand with you and pray for you, so the prayer team can be available,
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.280]   and in a moment, if you would like prayer, just come forward any time.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.320]   You don't have to wait until the end of the service.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   Just come forward.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:49.000]   Even right now, if you want to receive prayer, just start to come forward.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.440]   Someone's going to put their hands on you.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440]   They're going to pray for you.
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.920]   We're going to worship together, and we're going to believe that Christ is going to continue
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:00.360]   to set chains free, to restore people's identities, to break off the names and the words and the
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.160]   labels that have been placed on us, and we're going to do this in an atmosphere of joy and
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:10.440]   wonder for a God who loves us so much, and we thank you for that in Jesus' name.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.440]   Would you stand with me?
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.440]   And like I say, if you want prayer, don't be shy.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.440]   Come on, church.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.240]   We did this a few weeks ago, and people came forward for prayer.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.480]   We'd love to invite you to do that.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.960]   Otherwise, you can continue just to receive
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.860]   what He has for you as we enter in this time of worship.
