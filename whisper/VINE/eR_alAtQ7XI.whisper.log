[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Well, I'm really excited we're continuing our series on a different spirit.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We're looking at Caleb and Joshua, the 12 spies, numbers 13 and 14.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   And we've been looking at a bunch of different things over the last few weeks.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   But this week we're talking about what it is to be wholehearted before the Lord.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And I'm so excited because we get to hear from one of our pastors, Pastor Promise today.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   So why don't we put our hands together and invite Promise here.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Promise is looking smarter than I am.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Just want to point that out.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   It's probably because he is a bit smarter than I am.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   I want to say hi to mom and dad Armstrong who are tuning in from the US of A.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   It's great to have you guys with us.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   I know you're super proud of this young man, but we're super proud of him as well and we're excited.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I've heard his message already. It's an awesome message.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And I know this is going to be a real blessing to you where you're at.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   So would you stretch out your hands and just join me as we pray for Promise.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Father, we thank you for this man. We thank you for Caleb.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We thank you for baby on its way.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Lord, we thank you for all that you're doing through him and through them as a family.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And Lord, as we come to open your word today, Lord, we don't take that lightly.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   The fact that we can gather online in this room, that we have your word that speaks life to us,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   that we can open it and share it and laugh and find joy and yet be challenged and be changed.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Lord, we just thank you for Promise, for his passion, for his scripture,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and for his heart for these people.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And Lord, we pray for ourselves. You would open our hearts, Lord.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   We want to hear you.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   But Lord, we don't want to just have our ears tickled and have a good sermon,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   but we actually want to be changed.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   And that means when we wake up tomorrow, when we head into our workplaces and our schools
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   and our families and all the places where we have a sphere of influence,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   that Lord, you would take this word and it would become manifest in us.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And we ask that you would do this by your spirit and we thank you for it.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   In Jesus name.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Well, good morning, everybody.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It's pretty odd to be up here without a guitar or a microphone stand or some instrument.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Slightly tempted to go and just pick it up and maybe I'll speak more confidently.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'm very grateful to be here.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I am Promise Armstrong, as Pastor Angie just explained.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I serve here at the Vine as the Ministry Life Pastor,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   which means I get the great opportunity to work with our worship team,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   our production team, and our Sunday services and events team.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And this morning, I get the honor of sharing with you,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   continuing this series of A Different Spirit.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Over the past few weeks, we've looked at this journey.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   We've looked at what it means to have a different spirit.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   We've looked at the differences in the 12 spies that went out into the land.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   You've got 10 spies who bring back one report
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and you've got two spies that bring back a different.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And we've been looking and studying that, trying to understand
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   what does it mean to live with a different spirit.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   See, Caleb and Joshua are the ones who have this different spirit.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And in order for us to be the people God has us to be,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   we have to understand this and put it into our lives.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So the first thing we notice is this,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   that a different spirit is not a fairy tale spirit.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's not this conceptualized thing.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's pretty realistic, actually.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It's a spirit that is capable of seeing giants in the land,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   obstacles in mountains, yet it's able to focus its eyes
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   and its attention on the grapes.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   We see that a different spirit is like me and it's just like you,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   as in it also experiences fear.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's not immune to it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   But what makes it different is this,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   that rather than being a spirit that is intimidated
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and is formed by fear,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   a different spirit on the opposite end informs its fear with its faith.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   These are the things that it looks like to be a different spirit.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And for us today in 2021, a year that has been full of complexity,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   full of anxiety, for us to be the people God has us to be,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   it will require us to walk and live in that kind of spirit
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   where we are willing to stand up and step out
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   to bring hope and to bring life and to bring truth
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   into the darkest crevices of our society
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   rather than staying just in here,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   satisfied with just a 90-minute holy huddle.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Last week we learned that a different spirit
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   looks like a repentant spirit,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   a spirit that is willing to walk closely to God,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   that's willing to see sin for what it is and not minimize it,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   but run quickly to the Father's heart.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   All these things help us understand what it means
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   to live within a different spirit,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   a spirit that can see God, can see the grapes,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   can see the giants, and chooses where it focuses its attention towards.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So in the past narrative that we've been looking at,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   this numbers narrative, what's happened so far is this.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Moses has sent the 12 men into Jericho to look at the land,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   try and understand what's going on, and to bring back a report.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Ten of them bring back one report,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and two of them bring back a different report,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   which is a bit odd because all 12 of them went to the exact same place.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Interesting how you can all be in the same space,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   experience the same thing, yet walk away with a different takeaway,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   sometimes opposing takeaways.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And what it shows me is this,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   the difference in these spies isn't where their feet had been,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   but rather where their heart is positioned.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   [audience member exclaims]
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Caleb's heart was positioned after God.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Caleb's heart wanted God.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So when we look at this Numbers 14, verse 24,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   we get a clearer understanding.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   God, speaking to Moses, saying these words,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   "and follows me wholeheartedly,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   "I will bring him into the land he went into,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   "and his descendants will inherit it."
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   See, there's something about Caleb.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   There's something about his spirit
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   that's different than the spirit in the other ten.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And God attributes that to the willingness that Caleb has
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   to follow him fully, to follow just God.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   This is not just an observation of what a different spirit is.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   This is God himself overseeing the entire situation,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   watching the hearts and the actions of men
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   from Egypt all the way through the Red Sea to the desert,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   and seeing something in Caleb
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and identifying it clearly for Moses.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And he's saying that it's this willingness to follow me fully,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   wholeheartedly, and me alone.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   See, that's the DNA of what a different spirit is.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It's a spirit that's willing to follow God alone, God fully.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   That's the framework, that's the foundation
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   that we build this different spirit on.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And it's for this reason that Caleb is willing to see things
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and is able to see things that the others can't see.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   It's for this reason that Caleb is willing
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   to go into a land of giants with confidence
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   where the others are not.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   This is the heart of a different spirit.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So as we look closer at this verse,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   we see God's clear satisfaction in Caleb's spirit.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   But what we see about the spirit
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   is some really interesting things here.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It's not necessarily described as a super strong spirit.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It's not necessarily described as the best spirit,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   grade 8 spirit, top of the class spirit,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   the most financially stable spirit.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Those aren't the attributes that are given.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's not a spirit that you're just born with
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   or you're born without.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Instead, this spirit looks a lot like just following God
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   and following God alone.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Like that's really what this spirit is.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It's a spirit that chooses to follow after God,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   putting nothing on the same level as Him,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   fully devoted, undivided in its attention
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   and loyal to God and God alone.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's a spirit that puts nothing on par with God.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   No dreams, no hopes, no aspirations,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   nothing at the same level of devotion as with God.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It chooses God and it chooses God alone.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   So here's the thing, this is a pretty big definition.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Like that was a lot.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   God alone above everything else,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   that's not an easy thing to do.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It's the reason why only Caleb is mentioned here.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   That's like a 20% rate.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   That's good math.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   But what we see here is that it's not easy.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And I don't want to paint a picture of this super easy thing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It's something that we all will have to wrestle with,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   something that we will all have to work hard at.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And in our lives today, some of us might ask the question,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   is it even possible to put God above everything else in your life?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Like some of us are good at putting God
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   in a few sections of being number one in our lives,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   but can we really say He's number one in every area?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   In every area is God number one.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   It's a tough pill to swallow.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   It's a big ask.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   But I genuinely believe as we sit through this
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and as we let the Spirit minister to us
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   and understand these concepts
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and learn to apply these applications,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I genuinely believe that this will challenge us,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   but also will change who we are at our core.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   So let's dig in.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   To follow God is not just a congregational thing.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   There is a level of personal decision in following God like this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   You think about the story.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   These guys technically, you can say they followed God from Egypt
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   through the Red Sea when He parted it,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and it went up like this and they went through,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   across the sea, into the desert,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   at the brink of the Promised Land.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   They had technically been--
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I mean, He was going and they were following,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   pillar of cloud and fire,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   like they were following behind Him.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But interestingly enough, this verse says,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   "But because my servant Caleb,"
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   He identifies Caleb, He separates Caleb,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   "from the others."
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So there seems to be a difference in what's happening here.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   See, they were all walking behind God,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   but they weren't all following Him.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And there is a difference in that.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   As Susannah mentioned last week,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   just because we're walking in the same general direction as God
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   does not equate to following Him.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And I think that's why you can see that these spies all go
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   and have the same shared experience,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and Caleb's experience is different.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Caleb was following after God,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   and the others were walking behind him.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   See, when we think about that,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   it should make us wrestle with some questions.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Well, just, so I'm following behind God,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   or I'm walking behind God.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   How do I know?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   What could I actually be following
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   if I'm walking behind God?
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I'm doing all the right steps.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Am I actually following God?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I think we have to consider some of the thoughts here.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Could we be walking behind God, following something else?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Could there be something else that has our attention?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Maybe some end goal or some destination
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   or some method of how we would like to see God work in our lives
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   or how we would like to see God get us from point A to point B.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Could that be actually what we're following,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   disguised as following God?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   See, because what happens here is that
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   these guys follow God until it gets really difficult,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   and then they want to run back to Egypt.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And that's not what a different spirit is.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   A different spirit isn't the spirit that's like,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   "Yes, I'm following God. Sign me up
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   because he's leading me by green pastures, and that's great.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Oh, I'll still follow God because he's leading me by still waters,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   and that's great."
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But then you pump the brakes when God leads you up the mountain
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   because, "Oh, there's cliffs, there's rocks, it's cold, it's dangerous."
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Or when he leads you in the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   "Oh no, it's dark. We don't know what's going on.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Our enemies surround us. Maybe not, God. Let me second-guess this."
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Or even worse, into the land he promised to deliver you,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   yet because you see giants,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   you would rather go back into the bondage he set you out of.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   See, that's not what a different spirit is.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   But so often we can be tempted to walk in that way.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   A different spirit will choose to follow God,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   not depending on where he's taking you,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   but satisfied in knowing God will be there.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And that's what it was for Caleb.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   He was satisfied just knowing God is going before us,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   God will do it, God will be there.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And that's why he was able to follow the way that he was,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   with all of his heart.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   See, we often, we sometimes, often, semi-often,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   sing a song at the Vine here,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   which is probably my fault because normally I choose lots of those songs.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   But the song is called "Oceans,"
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and it was really popular back in like 2014.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It had this really cool bridge and everyone loved it
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   and people got tattoos of it.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It was really neat.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And the bridge goes on forever and ever and ever
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   until everyone stands up and raises their hands and gets into it.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   But the lyrics of the bridge read this,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   "Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   "Let me walk upon the waters wherever you may call me."
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   This is a hard song to live.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   It's a really catchy song to sing,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   but it's a hard song to live.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   But I believe that this song is the echo of Caleb's heart.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   God, wherever you will call me,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   mountainous, valley, it doesn't matter,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   wherever you will call me, Spirit lead me.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   This is how Caleb lived his life.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And I can't help but think that maybe Caleb must have known
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   something about God that made him throw in all his luck with him.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   There must have been something Caleb saw or experienced.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   There had to be something in that journey from Egypt to the desert
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   where he just learned to trust God
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and was convinced of something in God to where it didn't matter.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Regardless if there are giants, Caleb would follow.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Regardless if the city that you've promised us is fortified with massive walls,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Caleb is willing to follow.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Caleb believed and saw and was convinced of something in God that he saw
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   in no other person, in no other army, in no other people group, in no obstacle.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   There was something that he saw in God.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   See, Caleb saw grapes.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Caleb saw giants.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   But Caleb followed God.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   So this morning I ask you this, are you convinced God is who he says he is?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Because without that conviction, without being confident in that,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   it's going to be super hard to follow fully, to follow just him,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   to not want to follow him and all these other things as well.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Are you convinced God is who he says he is?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Have you seen enough?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Have you experienced enough to say, "I'm going to throw my luck in with him"?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Do you trust him to lead you wherever he may call?
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   See, it's clear that a different spirit follows God alone,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   but it is also clear that this is a challenge.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   It's hard.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It feels somewhat out of reach.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And I believe it's because of one little, kind of little, kind of long,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   but one word in this passage that we read.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So let's pull up the passage again, and it says this in Numbers 14, 24.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   "But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me"--
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   One more time.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   There we go.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   "--wholeheartedly."
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   There's our keyword.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   There's the clicker.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   What does that mean?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Obviously it's a big thing.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   It's this concept of a single-minded,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   so single-mindedly with enthusiastic devotion.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   It means fully following.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   It means that all of Caleb's heart belonged with God.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   It means he wasn't sharing his heart, half God, half something else.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   There wasn't, like, a roommate situation where God occupied two-thirds
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   and something else occupied the other.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Like, that's not how Caleb's heart works.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   See, the verse doesn't say Caleb followed God with a healthy amount of his heart,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   as some of us might interpret it as.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   No, it says "wholehearted."
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Here's the thing.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Whatever has our heart is what you're going to follow.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   If it isn't God, if God doesn't wholly have your heart,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   you're going to follow splintered.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   You're going to be going two different ways at once.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Whatever has your heart is what you'll follow.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Matthew 6, Jesus echoes this later on in Matthew 6.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   He says, "Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   It's important. It's critical we know what occupies our heart,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   what has our heart, what possesses our heart.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And do hear me on this.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I'm not saying that you can't love things with your heart.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   That would be a little odd.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   We should love things.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I have a great wife and I have a son coming in a couple of weeks.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I'm very excited to meet. I'm going to love him.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   But it doesn't mean that I can't love him if I'm going to be wholehearted.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   That doesn't work. So what does it mean?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   It means that nothing other than God is meant to hold or lead my heart.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   So following means that something has to be a leader.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   God can be the only thing that leads my heart,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   even if I love the things around me.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   What's really fascinating about this wholehearted concept
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   is its relationship to Caleb's name.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I find it very, very fascinating.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   For some of you who know me well, you know that I have been in seminary
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   and I just finished a semester of Hebrew II.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   I liked it so much I took it a second time.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   That's what I tell myself to sleep better at night.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   But in Hebrew, the word Caleb is actually pronounced "Ka-lev."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   It's a combination of two words, "Kal" and "lev."
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   So behind me you'll have some beautiful Hebrew.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   In case you need to get a tattoo at some point.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   So "Kal-lev" breaks down to this.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   The first word, "Kal," it's a "kaf" and a "lamet."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   It equals the word "whole" or "all" or "entirely."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   The second half of the word, "lev,"
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   which is a combination of the two Hebrew letters "lamet" and "bet,"
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   means "heart."
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Follow me here.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Caleb's name means "wholehearted."
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Caleb is the kind of person who is going to do everything wholehearted.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And it's really beautiful because if we had a nice, super poetic version of the Bible,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I'm convinced it would read like this.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   But because my servant, wholehearted, follows me wholeheartedly,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   we are called to be like that servant, wholehearted,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   and to follow wholeheartedly.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   See, that is the spirit of Caleb.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   That is the different spirit.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   This wholeheart concept is to follow God with all that we have.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Caleb follows with all of his heart, his whole heart.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Caleb isn't perfect.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   See, it doesn't say that because my servant, Caleb, is perfect.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   No, no, no, he doesn't say that.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   He says because he follows me with his whole heart.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   God is not hung up on perfection.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   This is something we really have to get down.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   God is not looking for your perfection.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   He's caring about your progress and your process.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   He's caring that you're willing to give all.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   See, God is like the one teacher who gives an A for effort.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I love those teachers.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   I really wish my Hebrew professor was one of those teachers.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Unfortunately, he has not been that way.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But he's like that.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   He's an A for effort kind of guy where whether or not you have every--
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It's like a little drawing, right?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And the kids are asked to color.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   It doesn't matter if you've colored in the lines.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You have the kid who grabs like six crayons with both hands and his feet
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and is coloring everything all together.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   That's the A for effort.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   That's the whole heart, using all that you have, all that you are to follow God.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   That's what he's asking for.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He's not asking for you to be perfect.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So don't allow that to intimidate you from drawing closer.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Whole heart devotion is where God has 100%.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Your heart belongs to him, nothing else.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Caleb's heart belonged to just God.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And you see, because of that, Caleb was willing to follow God into victory
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   or into what looked like defeat.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   It didn't matter because he was that all or nothing kind of guy.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And it's this wholeness, this wholeheartedness is driven by a love for God.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   See, we fall in the temptation of looking at the word all and saying some
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   or feeling some or living out some.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Actually, we were singing a song just now, "Jesus, It Is You,"
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   "All of My Rights, All of My Wrongs."
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   It's cool.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It's hard.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   If we were to be honest with ourselves, most of the times it's some of our rights,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   maybe most of our rights and some of our wrongs, right?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   We have these great Bible verses that we all love that are super influential
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   and have formed and shaped us into the people that we are
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   and that we would love to put on like a magnet to put on our fridge
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   or on a bumper sticker for our car that actually talks about some of these truths,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   about all.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   But the reality is that sometimes we live it as a some.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So let me read it to you so you get an understanding of where I'm going.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   "Love the Lord your God with some of your heart, half of your soul,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   part of your mind, a little bit of your strength."
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   That's not as tweetable, is it?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   What about this one?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   "Love the Lord with a portion of your heart and in some of your ways,"
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   just some, "acknowledge Him and He will make your path straight."
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   That doesn't flow off the tongue as well.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   No one really wants that as the verse that they hold on to, right?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Because we're tempted.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   We are tempted to give some.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And the reason that is is because we potentially are holding back something.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   We potentially have reserves.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   God's all or nothing principle is His way of calling out our backup plans.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   So you can't follow God wholeheartedly with reservations.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   You can't follow God wholeheartedly with holding things.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You can't follow God wholeheartedly with a bunch of backup plans.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   See, that was the thing with the 10 spies.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   The difficulty that they experienced surfaced what was really going on in their hearts.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   It surfaced their reality that they had, "If God doesn't work out,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   we'll just go back to Egypt," because they were real quick to say that.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Like that was like plan B.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   So to follow God, we can't have backup plans.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And what that does is it speaks to the faith and trust we have in God
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   to have to follow Him in this way.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   See, to follow God wholeheartedly is a heart that gives God access to all
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   because the most beautiful partial hearts will never be enough
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   to walk and follow behind God fully.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   The most beautiful partial, the most beautiful part of your heart
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   is never going to be enough to follow God fully
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   because that actually gives us to a point of either He is your God or He isn't God.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And I don't mean that you don't like Him or you don't take some notes
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   or you don't have a Bible or you don't do these good things.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Either He is God, which means He's God of all, or He's not,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   or we're withholding certain things.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I'm well aware that was a really hard thing to hear.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And so I want to spend the next few minutes really bringing us to a way
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   of understanding what can we do.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   God's not in heaven beating us over the head for not getting it right.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   That's not who He is.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   That's not His character.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   That's not His heart.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   He's calling us into wholehearted devotion.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And the good news is that He will be satisfied in our efforts.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   The efforts you put forward will be rewarded.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   You don't have to get it perfect.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   It's not about legalism.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   You don't have to check every box of praying 17 times a day
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   or memorizing all the scripture.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Like, that's not what it's about.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   But it's about the effort.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And so we're going to spend some time looking at three ways the effort can
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   play out and ways that we can take a step, just at least one step closer
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   towards giving God our all.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Is that okay?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   All right.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   So the first thing I want us to think about is this.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   We tend not to follow what we don't know.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   I'm aware I use a double negative.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I'm so sorry for any grammar freaks out there.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   We will not follow what we don't know.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Right?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   It's just if you don't know somebody, if you don't know what they stand for,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   if you don't know their values, their guiding principles,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   the story behind them, their reputation,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   you probably will not reprioritize your entire life to where they are
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   above everything.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   That's just not how we operate.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   We even teach this to our children.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   We have a phrase called "stranger danger."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   You teach your child not to follow some random person that they don't know,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   right, because we want them to be safe.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Babies do this on their own.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Like if you bring -- Pastor Allison has a cute little nine-month-old.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   If you just leave him with me, yeah, little Isaiah is going to scream.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Rightly so.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   He doesn't know me.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   One of my good friends, Denny, he has a two-year-old now,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   but earlier in her life she was just like little Isaiah.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   She didn't know me.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   She didn't know me at all.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   So every time they would leave her with me, they would be like,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   "Here, promise, hold her."
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Never turned out well.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   They took her back immediately.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   But it's because she did not know me.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   She did not know me.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I was not familiar.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   But something changed in the past few years.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   As Emmy grew older, we spent more time together.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Our families took trips together.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   We spent Christmas Eve and all these different occasions together.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Emmy started to know me.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Emmy started to really know me to the point where if I showed up at her house
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   today, little Emmy would stop what she's doing and would do anything that I'm
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   doing in that house.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   If I'm running around and making a mess out of what they had just nicely
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   cleaned up, Emmy will do the same.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   If I'm taking things out of the fridge and putting it in the bedroom,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Emmy's going to do the same.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   If I am throwing balls everywhere and playing basketball in the living room,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Emmy is going to follow me and do the exact same thing.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Her parents won't like us, but she will follow me into that.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   But it shows me something.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Emmy knows me.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Now that she's familiar with me, she's willing to follow me,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   how much more when we become familiar with who God is will we be willing to
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   follow him?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Let your knowing of God lead to your trusting of God.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   That's my second point.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Let what you know of God lead to how you trust him.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   See, we know he's sovereign.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   We know he's good.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   It's time we learn to trust that he's sovereign and trust that he's good.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   We have to trust that when we follow him and we reach a place of difficulty,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   a challenge, a dark space, a mountain, that he is capable of leading us
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   through that.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   We have to trust that even though this year has been absolutely difficult,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   the last few years have been really difficult for every person on the globe,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   that he's aware.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   He knows of the job losses.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   He knows about the relocation.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   He knows about the family members that have fallen sick.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   He's there.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   He's with us.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   And we have to trust that.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   See, God isn't saying, "Oops, 2021 just slipped out of my hands.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Oh, I didn't know that was happening.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Man."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   That's not how he operates.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   But he's with us.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   We have to trust that he is not careless but that he is radically in love with
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   every single one of us, knowing every aspect of our lives.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   He's not going to be forgetful.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   He's not going to be unfaithful.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   He's a good shepherd.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   And maybe one of the ways we can take this concept and boil it down to a
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   practical step is let me challenge you this week, before you start your day,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   before you get on the train and deal with people who you may not like,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   before you open your email and have to become the boss that you are,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   maybe create a moment and verbally say the words, "Jesus,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I choose to trust you."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Maybe allow yourself to say, "Jesus, I choose to trust you," and see what
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   that confession of your heart will do to your willingness to follow him,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   to hear him, to be more like him.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   "Jesus, I trust you."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   See how that realigns your heart and your priorities with his.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   "Jesus, I trust you."
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   See how that impacts and affects your anxiety.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   "Jesus, I trust you."
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   See, when we trust someone, it becomes so much easier to follow them.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   And here's the last thing.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   It's all about the eyes.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   It's all about the eyes.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   See, we live in a world, as Andrew just shared, full of distraction.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   There are things everywhere to look at.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   There are things calling for our attention.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And that's what the story was for these guys as well.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   They walk into a land and it had obstacles and giants and grapes and
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   probably other things.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   What's different, what allows us to follow God better with more of our
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   hearts is where we know where to fix our eyes.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I'm not saying you can't look and see other things.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   We are aware that both Caleb, Joshua, and all the other ten saw the giants.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   They all saw them.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   They all saw the walls.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   They saw the grapes.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   But there's a difference in what you see and what you fix your eyes and your
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   attention on.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   And perhaps when we learn to fix our eyes on God, and not just because it's a
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   cool thing to do or because there's like a hymn about it somewhere, but when we
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   fix our eyes towards God, we see that's where our hope comes from.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   When we fix our eyes towards God, that's where our strength to navigate through
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   these situations comes from.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   When we fix our eyes on him, that's where all we need will come from.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   See, the problem with the ten spies is that they had a vision problem.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   They had a seeing problem.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   They focused more of their eyes and their attention on the obstacles, on the
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   giants and on God.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And if I'm honest, I'm very similar.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Actually, both me and my wife are very similar.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   We are what you call fix-it people.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   We like to fix things.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   If anything is slightly broken, slightly not working, we will try to fix it.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Luckily, we've not tried to fix one another yet.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   So still doing well.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And sorry.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   There's a role that we get to play in following God, and it's not the fixing.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   It's fixing our eyes, but it's not the fixing.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Because the battle that we step into, the mountains that are in front of us,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   those obstacles have been overcome.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   God has gone before you.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   God has been there.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   He makes a way where there is no way.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   That's just what he does.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   That's just who he is.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And so when we fix our eyes on God and not on the problem, we stop trying to
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   solve it, and we let God be God, and we just follow.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   That's not the easiest thing to do.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   A lot of us like to fix things.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   And so it requires us to be aware of this tendency in our hearts and to fix our
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   eyes on him.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   And think of Joshua, as the story continues.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   If Joshua would have spent more time fixing his eyes on, okay, the walls are
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   this tall, a couple meters, and I need to get 15, 16 ladders, and I have 700
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   people, we need to -- if he started fixing his eyes on all the ways he could
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   overcome this obstacle, he potentially would have missed God.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Because God's method wasn't the way that we would normally go.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   No one looks at capturing a city or winning a battle by walking around it and
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   singing.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   That's unheard of.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Unless you fix your eyes.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   In him, when we fix our eyes, that's where our victory is.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And so, church, I want to encourage you this morning to fix your eyes, to trust
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   him.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Make it a challenge to yourself this week, Jesus, I trust you.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   To spend some time asking yourself, what am I holding back?
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   What am I withholding from him?
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   What are my reservations and why?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Ask yourself, do you know him?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Do you know of him?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Do you know him?
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And spend some time, read his stories, hear about who he is.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   The Bible is full, full of ways for us to get to know him better.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   And I think it's when we have that, we can walk in the confidence of Caleb to
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   fully, wholeheartedly follow God and God alone, devoted to just him.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Let's pray.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Jesus, we thank you that you call us to a place of very, very, very deep
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   surrender.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   God, to a place where our eyes have to be set on you, our heart has to be
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   locked into who you are, and a place of getting to know you.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   God, we thank you that the battle has been won.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   God, we thank you that you are good and that we can trust that.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   We thank you that you are faithful and we can trust that.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   And God, you know each of our stories, you know each of the ways that we lean,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   you know each of our tendencies.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And Holy Spirit, we invite you in this moment to come and speak, to come and
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   illuminate the things that we are withholding, the things that we are
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   reserving, the ways in which we don't yet trust, the ways in which we don't
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   yet know.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   God, we thank you that you are a God that is gracious and kind, that you are
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   patient, that you're not waiting for us to get it perfect, but you're waiting
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   for us to trust you enough to give all.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   So God, would you help us, would you help me follow you more fully?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.580]   (gentle music)
