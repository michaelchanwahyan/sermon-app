1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 (gentle piano music)

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:26,840
 When he shall come with trumpet sound,

3
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,480
 and may I then in him be found,

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,880
 dressed only in his righteousness,

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,480
 faultless I stand before his throne.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,240
 The words of that beautiful modern day hymn

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,920
 that we've just heard really resonate

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,280
 with a central theme that we're looking at here

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,600
 in our Advent season at the Vine in 2024.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,720
 We've been saying each week, haven't we,

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,720
 that Advent is not just about the birth of Christ,

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,160
 it's also about this longing for his return.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,360
 And I love how that song picks up that longing.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,840
 When the trumpets sound, Christ will return to this world.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,460
 And as he returns, his heart is to make this whole world

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,980
 just as he had always planned and designed for it to be.

17
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,080
 We read in that picture in Revelation 21 and 22

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,120
 that he's gonna make all things new,

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,800
 this desire to bring every tribe and tongue

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,880
 and nation together, praising him in a city

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,280
 that will come from heaven down to earth,

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,840
 drawing together all people, no more sin,

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,840
 no more brokenness, no more death.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,960
 We will all find life to its fullness

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,000
 in the presence of him.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
 And I love the way that the writer of that song

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,820
 expresses that sense within them, this idea of confidence.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,020
 They say, here's where my confidence will be on that day.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,000
 It's not gonna be in me.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,800
 It's not gonna be in how well that I live my life.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,840
 It's not gonna be that I had all the answers

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,760
 and I knew everything and I did the best that I could.

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,240
 No, he says, I will be dressed in his righteousness alone.

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,000
 In other words, the only thing I'm gonna have on that day,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,680
 the only thing I need to have on that day

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,000
 is not my goodness, not my strength,

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,760
 not me having figured it all out.

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,780
 It's only in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus,

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,120
 what he's done on the cross,

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
 how he's paid the price for my sin,

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,240
 how I've come into that forgiveness

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
 and redemption for myself.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,560
 And I'm gonna be dressed, not in my righteousness,

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,600
 as if I'm dressed in my righteousness on that day,

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,920
 things are not gonna go well.

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,320
 I'm gonna be dressed in his righteousness alone.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,640
 And if that's the case,

48
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,020
 then I will be faultless before his throne.

49
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,560
 And so in this beautiful lyrics

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,800
 that we've just been sitting with,

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,120
 and sometimes when we sing these songs,

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,600
 we don't actually kind of dig into the theology,

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,540
 the beautiful theology that sits behind them.

54
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,640
 But when we sit in the resonance of that idea,

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,140
 we can kind of pick up what Paul's been saying to us

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,040
 throughout this series about the now, but not yet,

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,680
 that we're in and the three things that remain,

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,840
 because the confidence that that writer is speaking about

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
 of standing in his righteousness alone,

60
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,400
 that's picking up one of the major themes for Paul

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,440
 that remains for us in this now, but not yet time.

62
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
 And that's the theme of hope.

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
 Ah, yes, hope.

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,880
 Paul says that three things do remain

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,520
 when we struggle in the now, but not yet season

66
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,200
 that we're in, faith, hope, and love.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
 And he says the greatest of these is love.

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,640
 And next week, we're gonna look at that,

69
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
 and I'm gonna explain why he says

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,600
 the greatest of these is love.

71
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,320
 But although it's true that love

72
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,720
 is the greatest of what remains,

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,920
 I think the thing that remains the most

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,000
 that we need the most right now is hope.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,080
 I don't know if you've kind of picked this up yourself

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,360
 or not, but I think we're living in what I would say

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,600
 is a time of hope crisis.

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,480
 If you just open your ears to the conversations

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,520
 that are happening here in our city,

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,800
 in the cafes and in the lunch spots

81
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,520
 and in the bars after work and in the restaurants,

82
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,280
 if you kind of listen in to how people are talking,

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,240
 you can get a sense that there's a deep sense

84
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,800
 of helplessness and hopelessness here

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,480
 in our city at the moment.

86
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
 I wonder if this resonates a little bit

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,920
 with perhaps how you feel as you think about

88
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,480
 the future of Hong Kong and think about what it means

89
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,160
 to be a person that's living here,

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,920
 perhaps there's a certain sense

91
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,000
 of that hopelessness in you too.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,240
 It was really interesting, last week we had

93
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,960
 our Christmas market and one of the organizations

94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,600
 that was a part of the Christmas market was Eden last week.

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,880
 And Eden are an anti-trafficking,

96
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
 anti-human trafficking organization.

97
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,800
 And they produce jewelry and they sell this jewelry

98
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,320
 to help fund the work they do, but they produce a card.

99
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,960
 And when they do markets all over Hong Kong

100
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,320
 and they're doing them all the time,

101
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,440
 young people will come to them to look at the stuff

102
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,800
 that they have, they will give the young people a card

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,760
 and on that card are some words.

104
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
 All those words are biblical words,

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,800
 although of course the people don't know that,

106
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,160
 but there are all these biblical words that are on this card

107
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,600
 and they say to the people, hey, why don't you choose

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,440
 the word that resonates most with you?

109
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,240
 The word that connects to where you're at right now

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,640
 or perhaps the word that you need the most

111
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,200
 and then we'll show you the jewelry

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,880
 that's associated with that word.

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,080
 And they told me last week and you can probably guess

114
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,480
 that the single most common word

115
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,680
 that the young people of our city say to them

116
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
 every time they look at that list

117
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
 is the word, you guessed it, hope.

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,320
 It's as if our young people are saying,

119
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,480
 we're not sure where our hope lies anymore.

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,920
 We're not sure if we have the hope

121
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,480
 that we used to think that we had.

122
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,400
 But if we're honest though, it's not just the young people

123
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,600
 that perhaps are feeling that way,

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,680
 I think it's all the generations.

125
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,320
 And in fact, it's not actually even just what's happening

126
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,480
 here in Hong Kong.

127
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,440
 I mean, if we lift our heads up a little bit

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,520
 from our own city and our own circumstances

129
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,280
 and we look at around the world around us,

130
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,080
 we can see that actually there's a hope crisis

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
 around the whole world.

132
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,480
 That actually the reality is that the conversations

133
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,360
 are doom and gloom and despair

134
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,240
 in many parts of the world right now.

135
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,720
 And when you peel back the layer and you look at that

136
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,400
 and you look at the evidence that's out there,

137
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,800
 you can kind of understand why we're in this hope crisis.

138
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,680
 I mean, it's not like there's nothing going on.

139
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
 There's some pretty sad, pretty heavy,

140
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,160
 pretty crazy stuff that's happening in our world right now.

141
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,880
 I mean, levels of exploitation are happening in this world

142
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,040
 at levels that they've never happened before.

143
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,720
 The poor and the vulnerable and marginalized

144
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,640
 are being exploited more than ever.

145
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,560
 There's economic disparity in our world

146
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
 at a higher level than ever before.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,160
 That's tracked by the Gini coefficient.

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,240
 And the Gini coefficient is higher

149
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
 for the Western developed world than it's ever been.

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,200
 The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer.

151
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,160
 And then you look at kind of what's happening

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,480
 within many of the cultures of this world,

153
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,520
 and you can see so much abuse that's taking place,

154
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,360
 so much of a rise in senseless violence,

155
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
 so much exploitation that's happening

156
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,760
 for those who are vulnerable, hate crimes on the rise,

157
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,520
 gender abuse and gender violence.

158
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,240
 The look at things that are taking place

159
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,480
 in the wars around the world right now.

160
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,840
 And whenever there's war, here's the thing,

161
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,200
 there's always a group of people that suffer the most,

162
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,280
 and that's the innocents,

163
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
 and mostly that is often children.

164
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,320
 And we're seeing that over the last couple of years.

165
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,000
 If you take a look at the things

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
 that are taking place in our world,

167
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,040
 it's understandable perhaps

168
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,480
 that there is a bit of a hope crisis.

169
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,320
 And here's what I realized

170
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,000
 that I'm even hearing this amongst us here at the Vine.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,760
 In the conversations that I have with you,

172
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,280
 in the conversations our pastoral team, we know,

173
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,800
 there's a great sense of helplessness

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,680
 amongst us as a community.

175
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,440
 It almost feels like hope has been dragged away

176
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,320
 from many of us in this room.

177
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,480
 Maybe as you're coming to the end of 2024,

178
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,560
 a lot of you in this room are saying,

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,320
 "Thank goodness that year's over,

180
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,640
 because I've been dragged down, and I've been held back,

181
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,600
 and I lost my job, and I had that diagnosis,

182
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
 and there's all this stuff that's happening,

183
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,480
 and it hasn't been a great year for me."

184
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,160
 And the reality is that sense of doom,

185
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,480
 that sense of gloom, I think it's not just over the world,

186
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,840
 I think it's over the church.

187
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,520
 And here's what worries me about that.

188
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,320
 Because if there should ever be a group of people

189
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,520
 in the world right now who could actually stand up

190
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,080
 and speak about a different way,

191
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,960
 who could actually begin to communicate

192
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,920
 that there's another narrative than the doom and the gloom

193
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
 that we're seeing in the world,

194
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,800
 then surely it should be the church.

195
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,600
 But I have a sense that the church

196
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,120
 is as hopeless as everybody else.

197
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,240
 And what I wanna do over the next 30 minutes

198
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,800
 is I wanna light a little fire under us.

199
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,160
 And I wanna actually begin to change your thinking

200
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,320
 about hope, because I think one of the reasons

201
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,400
 why the church has become so hopeless in this time

202
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,680
 when there needs to be a voice of hope

203
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,800
 is because we've actually come to define hope

204
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,160
 just like everybody else does in the world.

205
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,520
 I think even the idea of me speaking about hope this morning,

206
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,960
 if you're anything like me,

207
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,080
 that raises some pretty uncomfortable emotions at times.

208
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,240
 That's a pretty complex thing that happens to us.

209
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,560
 Because perhaps some of you are sitting here right now,

210
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
 and you've been burnt by hope in the past.

211
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,720
 Maybe you had hope for a season,

212
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,320
 but hope didn't work out for you.

213
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,400
 Maybe you were hoping that that relationship

214
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,560
 that was going on in your life,

215
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,800
 you were hoping that that got better,

216
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,960
 but it didn't get better.

217
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,760
 Maybe you were hoping to get a job this year,

218
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,680
 a job that you've always wanted and always dreamt for,

219
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,840
 and you had endless interviews, but nobody hired you.

220
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,280
 Or maybe there was a debt

221
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,080
 that you were hoping to pay off this year,

222
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,680
 and you didn't manage to pay it off,

223
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
 and you're wondering why.

224
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,880
 Or maybe you were trying to lead some people

225
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,960
 to faith this year, and they didn't come to faith,

226
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,040
 and you're beginning to ask questions.

227
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,200
 Or maybe you're grappling in a relationship,

228
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,240
 and you thought that that relationship would sort it out.

229
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
 Maybe there's a dispute going on,

230
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,400
 and you had great hope that 2024 would be the year

231
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,480
 when you would finally sort out that relationship,

232
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,760
 and it hasn't been sorted out,

233
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,800
 and you're entering into the new year

234
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,080
 with as much gloom about that as anything else.

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,040
 And all these things that you had been hoping for,

236
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,640
 nothing seems to have changed,

237
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,080
 nothing seems to have happened,

238
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,240
 nothing has come through.

239
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,440
 And if you're feeling like that,

240
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,080
 well, I feel like that a lot too.

241
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,640
 'Cause we are burnt at times by hope.

242
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,480
 And when you're burnt by hope,

243
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,120
 it makes you not even wanna think about it.

244
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,520
 And then when somebody like me starts to talk about it,

245
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,760
 you immediately kind of go,

246
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
 ah, I don't wanna be set up for failure again.

247
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,200
 Like, I'm not sure about this hope thing.

248
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,560
 I tried it, I tried it out,

249
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,680
 but it didn't quite work out for me.

250
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,760
 And I think as Christians,

251
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,200
 we have a tension that sits within us.

252
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,160
 'Cause we have this thought, don't we?

253
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,720
 That hope is a good thing,

254
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,360
 that this should be a good thing.

255
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,920
 The idea of hope is good.

256
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,480
 And yet the reality of our lives

257
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,200
 sometimes doesn't seem to add up to that.

258
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,000
 And we kind of sit within this tension

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,520
 between a good idea of hope

260
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,000
 and the reality that hope hasn't often come through for us.

261
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,600
 And as Christians, we wrestle with that,

262
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,240
 and we're not quite sure what to do with it.

263
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,920
 So when the topic of hope comes up,

264
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,640
 we kind of silence our voices.

265
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
 And I think a lot of reasons for this

266
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,560
 is because we are beginning to define hope

267
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,200
 the same way that society sees hope.

268
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,040
 Let me explain.

269
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,640
 Society, I think, essentially defines hope this way,

270
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,280
 that hope is an expressed desire

271
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,120
 for a positive outcome that is uncertain.

272
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,200
 Let me give an example.

273
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
 My daughter Mia, who's 14 years old,

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,560
 she this year is hoping for an iPad for Christmas.

275
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,760
 Now, when my daughter hopes for an iPad for Christmas,

276
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,360
 here's what she really means.

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,760
 "I have no idea if mom and dad are gonna buy me an iPad,

278
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,440
 "but I hope that they do.

279
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,760
 "I'm putting all my trust and all my hope

280
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,320
 "in something that is kind of uncertain,

281
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,560
 "but I'm hoping they'll come through for me."

282
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,600
 She doesn't know whether we're buying her one or not.

283
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,960
 By the way, she's not in this service.

284
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,040
 Let me just tell you, that's a false hope.

285
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,200
 We are not buying her an iPad this Christmas.

286
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,720
 Have you seen how expensive iPads are?

287
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,800
 I know, give me money, I will buy one.

288
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,840
 We're not buying her an iPad.

289
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,200
 That's a false hope, it's not happening.

290
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,720
 Or maybe you're sitting there and you think,

291
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,600
 "I hope Pastor Andrew only preaches for 15 minutes today,

292
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,160
 "'cause I wanna get out there and eat my cookies."

293
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,440
 What you're really meaning by that is,

294
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,560
 "I have no idea how long Pastor Andrew's going

295
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,400
 "to be preaching for.

296
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,440
 "I desire that it would be short,

297
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,320
 "but the fact that I've been coming to the Vine for so long,

298
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,200
 "I'll know that he'll probably go on for hours."

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,080
 But I had this expressed desire for it.

300
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,360
 You see what I'm saying?

301
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,000
 So hope is so often defined by this positive thing

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,160
 that I wanna happen,

303
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,520
 but I have no certainty that it's gonna happen.

304
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,880
 So hope becomes so uncertain.

305
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,320
 And when hope is defined essentially by uncertainties,

306
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,800
 by kinda, "I'm gonna throw a dart at a dartboard

307
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,880
 "and kinda hope that I'll hit a good number or whatever,

308
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,400
 "but I just don't know."

309
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,360
 Well, then when somebody says,

310
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,440
 "Hey, put your life into hope," you're like,

311
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,240
 "Hmm, I don't know if I should trust something

312
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,880
 "that is so out there."

313
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,520
 It raises a very important question for us.

314
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,480
 Why would I put my faith in something as flimsy,

315
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,560
 as uncertain, as doubtful as a hope?

316
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,200
 Are you with me?

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,440
 So because this is the case, here's what I've discovered.

318
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,200
 Christians don't really talk about hope very much.

319
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,440
 I mean, this fascinated me.

320
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,400
 I went to Bible school, to seminary for four years.

321
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,080
 We never did a class on hope.

322
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,000
 Faith, we did a lot of classes on faith, okay?

323
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
 Love, we nailed love.

324
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,720
 We talked about love all the time.

325
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,120
 We never once talked about hope.

326
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,080
 The only time that hope was mentioned at my seminary

327
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,360
 was by the teachers,

328
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,400
 because one of my classmates' first name was Hope.

329
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,920
 That was the only time when they ever mentioned

330
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,080
 the word hope.

331
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,640
 Us Christians, we don't talk about it

332
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,080
 'cause I think we're uncomfortable with it, and here's why.

333
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,440
 Because we're defining it in the same way

334
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,080
 that society defines it,

335
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,200
 and if hope is a desired positive outcome

336
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,760
 that is kind of uncertain,

337
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,120
 we don't wanna set people up for failure,

338
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,240
 so we've quietened our voice at the very time

339
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,440
 where the world needs to hear about hope again.

340
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,760
 The very people that should have the best thing to say

341
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,920
 about it are just not speaking up.

342
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,880
 Here's the funny thing.

343
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,480
 The Bible has a lot to say about hope.

344
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
 In fact, hope is mentioned over 600 times in our scriptures.

345
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,600
 Pretty much every book of the Bible

346
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,160
 has some sort of teaching or thought on hope.

347
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,680
 When you get to the New Testament,

348
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,960
 every second or third page in the New Testament

349
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,120
 speaks about this idea of hope.

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
 The Bible is filled with it.

351
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,320
 We should be filled with it.

352
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,800
 Paul, riding into the church,

353
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,280
 trying to help them to wrestle with this Advent thing

354
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,120
 that we've been talking about,

355
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,520
 the now but not yet, that Christ has come,

356
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,560
 that He is coming back, we're living in the in-between.

357
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,120
 Paul rides into his church,

358
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,160
 and he desperately wants them to understand

359
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,160
 that hope is a good thing, that hope is alive,

360
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,640
 that hope can change everything.

361
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,720
 But his church, like us today,

362
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,920
 are wrestling with the flimsy,

363
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,240
 uncertain kind of weirdness to hope.

364
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,280
 And so he writes in and he says,

365
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,720
 look, over 36 times in his letters,

366
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,200
 he mentions hope, 36 times.

367
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
 And every time he mentions hope,

368
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,280
 it's always embedded in a very important part of the letter

369
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,800
 and what he's trying to teach his church.

370
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,240
 And what I wanna do today is show you one of those moments

371
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
 'cause out of it, I wanna draw for you

372
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,920
 a better way of thinking about hope.

373
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,840
 And if you've walked in here today,

374
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,080
 again, a little bit like how I often wrestle with it,

375
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,280
 thinking like, when has hope ever done anything good for me?

376
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,040
 My prayer is that as you leave today,

377
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,240
 you will leave refreshed and renewed

378
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,080
 to become the voice that I think God

379
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,800
 is actually calling you to be

380
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,400
 in a time of a crisis of hope.

381
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,560
 Paul writes to one of his prodigies, a guy called Titus.

382
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,120
 You may not have looked at the book of Titus

383
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,400
 in the New Testament much, it's a very short book.

384
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,040
 Paul is writing to a man

385
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,400
 that he had spent a lot of time raising up,

386
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,040
 one of his prodigies, if you will.

387
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,160
 He was a church planter and a pastor in Crete,

388
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,800
 which is a small little island

389
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,760
 in the middle of the Mediterranean Ocean.

390
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,400
 And Paul writes to him and speaks to him

391
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,440
 about this idea of hope.

392
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,600
 There's just three verses, chapter two,

393
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,080
 starting in verse 11, let me read this to you.

394
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,880
 For the grace of God has appeared

395
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,800
 that brings salvation to all people.

396
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,280
 It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions

397
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,920
 and to live self-controlled and upright godly lives

398
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,720
 in this present age.

399
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,640
 While we wait, notice this, for the blessed hope,

400
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,640
 the glorious appearance or the appearance of glory

401
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,320
 of our great God and savior, Jesus Christ.

402
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,520
 In just these three verses,

403
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,840
 Paul does something that he does

404
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,960
 in many places in his writings.

405
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,080
 He often, in just three verses,

406
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,680
 gives you something that's in the past,

407
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,720
 something in the present and something in the future.

408
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,600
 And you can see that when we break down the passage here.

409
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,040
 He's got something about what's happened in the past,

410
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,680
 something that should impact what's going on in the present.

411
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,080
 And then he leans us forward to the future.

412
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,680
 This is Paul's now but not yet tension

413
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,400
 in the time in which we live in.

414
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,640
 Christ has come, we're living in this time

415
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,480
 and Christ is coming.

416
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,320
 And that's the second thing, notice,

417
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,280
 he speaks about the appearance of God

418
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,960
 in the first place in the past.

419
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,960
 That's speaking about his first advent, his first coming.

420
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,720
 And then he speaks about at the end,

421
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,000
 his glory of his second return.

422
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,400
 That's speaking about the end of all things.

423
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,640
 And Paul is wanting his church to understand

424
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,360
 that they're living in this time between those two events.

425
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,320
 But then notice what he says remains.

426
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,080
 This is kind of a parallel passage

427
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,800
 to that 1 Corinthians 13 passage.

428
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,280
 He says, "There is a blessed hope."

429
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,520
 I love that phrase, blessed hope.

430
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
 Because like I was saying earlier,

431
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,720
 I think so often we think hope is cursed.

432
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,560
 Oh, we tried, we hoped, it didn't work out.

433
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,560
 And we got burnt again and hope didn't come through.

434
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,400
 Paul's writing and saying,

435
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,640
 "No, you need to begin to think differently about hope

436
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,720
 'cause hope is not cursed, hope is blessed.

437
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,440
 Hope is a blessing, hope brings blessing.

438
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,040
 And when we begin to understand the power that is in hope,

439
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,880
 it changes the way you begin to think.

440
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,360
 And rather than the church being sort of alongside

441
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,680
 of the rest of the world and thinking that hope is cursed,

442
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,120
 the church could raise up and begin to be a blessing

443
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,360
 in a time of crisis.

444
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,920
 Now, he's saying this is a blessed hope

445
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,800
 because Paul is teaching and understanding something

446
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,440
 that we all need to understand.

447
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,960
 Paul is not placing his hope in circumstance.

448
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,760
 He's not placing his hope here in some positive thinking

449
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,520
 or a way of having kind of better thoughts about something.

450
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,800
 He's not even placing hope within himself.

451
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,400
 Oh, I know what God has done in me, or I know who I am,

452
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
 or I know what I used to be,

453
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
 but I also know who I am today.

454
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,480
 And that gives me great hope.

455
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,600
 Not even in himself.

456
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,080
 He's saying the only place where hope can be found

457
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,720
 is in the one who is certain, the one who is all loving,

458
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,560
 the one who's all good, our hope is blessed

459
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,360
 'cause it's not found in our circumstances, our situations,

460
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,240
 it's found in the one who's never changing.

461
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,560
 It's found in him, in God.

462
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
 God is hope.

463
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,480
 In other words, Paul is saying God doesn't give hope,

464
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
 God is hope.

465
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,040
 And when you begin to shift your thinking away from,

466
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,000
 hey, my hope is in something that's uncertain,

467
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,440
 of course, that's gonna be cursed most of the time,

468
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,360
 but when you place your hope in the certainty

469
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,880
 of the one who never changes, then your hope becomes blessed.

470
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,040
 Paul would write differently to the church in Colossae,

471
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,880
 and he would say, look,

472
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,520
 you've got to understand it like this.

473
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,160
 I know what it is to be wealthy.

474
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
 I know what it is to be poor.

475
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,240
 I know what it is to be hungry.

476
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
 I know what it is to be well-fed.

477
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,000
 I know what it is to be shipwrecked.

478
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I know what it is to be safe.

479
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,080
 He goes through all this list,

480
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,920
 and he says, no matter the circumstance in my life,

481
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,360
 I have come to learn what it is to be content

482
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
 in any circumstance.

483
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,120
 He's talking about blessed hope,

484
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,400
 and he's holding onto this concept of hope being blessed

485
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,520
 because he's placing it not in uncertainty,

486
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,400
 but in what is certain.

487
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,360
 My daughter is placing her hope

488
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,240
 in the uncertainty of Chris and I's bank account,

489
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,920
 and that is very uncertain.

490
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,000
 I can let you know that now.

491
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,720
 Paul's not making that mistake.

492
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,000
 He's placing his hope in the only one

493
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,960
 that can be the fullness of that hope,

494
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,920
 and that's a beautiful, glorious, good thing.

495
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,080
 Ah, hope is blessed, he's saying.

496
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,440
 Hope is not in us.

497
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,080
 It's not in circumstance, as it's saying here behind me.

498
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,080
 It's not in just idea of positive thinking.

499
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,320
 It's not in kind of facts that kind of work themselves out.

500
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,720
 No, hope is only ever in this unchanging, lovable,

501
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,880
 this incredibly purposeful God who speaks truth

502
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,120
 and can only speak truth.

503
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,760
 That's where our hope is found.

504
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,240
 Are you with me?

505
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,360
 Now, as we begin to place our hope in that,

506
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,680
 he says, this is a blessed hope,

507
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,800
 and he said, you need to realize why this hope is blessed,

508
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,280
 and this is where he speaks about two incredible things.

509
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,240
 He goes back to the first advent of Christ,

510
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,160
 and I want you to notice the word he uses.

511
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,880
 He says, there is the grace of God appeared to us before.

512
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,440
 So he uses a word to link that summarizes

513
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
 what it is that God did in his first advent.

514
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,520
 He calls it grace.

515
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,200
 In other words, that Jesus was born

516
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,120
 in that stable in Bethlehem,

517
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,760
 that Jesus grew up to inaugurate the kingdom,

518
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,120
 that Jesus went to the cross to die for our sins,

519
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,200
 that, he's saying, is a story of grace,

520
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,120
 and because God came before,

521
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,520
 our hope is based in a story of grace.

522
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,000
 This grace means that if you align your heart and your life

523
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,440
 to the saving power of Jesus,

524
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,800
 if you recognize that he went to that cross

525
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,000
 to pay for your sin,

526
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,120
 he did that whilst you were still a sinner.

527
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,320
 He did that before you even knew him.

528
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,120
 He so loved you that he responded to you

529
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,240
 before you even knew that you needed him

530
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,600
 to be responding to.

531
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
 That's the story of grace,

532
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,880
 and Paul's saying your hope is founded on the root

533
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
 of this crazy idea that God's grace saves you,

534
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,040
 changes you, transforms you, equips you,

535
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,280
 and it's all because you didn't earn it,

536
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,880
 you didn't do something good for it.

537
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,800
 Even when you were still in the darkest depths of your sin,

538
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,480
 he came and loved you.

539
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,280
 That's grace.

540
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,000
 So he's like, understand that your hope is not arbitrary.

541
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,880
 That hope came at a high price.

542
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,280
 It came at the gift of the grace of a God

543
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,200
 who sent his son to die for your sins.

544
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,800
 Blessed hope, he says.

545
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,640
 But it's not just based in grace.

546
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,560
 He then takes us to the return of Christ

547
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,600
 at the end of all things,

548
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,920
 and he uses a different word.

549
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,480
 He says when he comes back, you will see glory.

550
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,240
 So he says our story of hope

551
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,760
 starts in this grace that's brought to us,

552
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,080
 but it's completed in this glory that comes

553
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,280
 when Christ returns.

554
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
 The glorification of the whole redemptive story

555
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,680
 that what Christ began in his birth and in his life

556
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,320
 and in his death and his resurrection only gets completed

557
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
 when he comes back to this world

558
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,480
 to restore and renew all things.

559
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,320
 That is when we get to see him in the glory.

560
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,480
 And Paul's saying your hope

561
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
 is not just founded in the grace story,

562
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
 it's also founded in the glory story.

563
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,160
 In fact, if he doesn't return,

564
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,200
 that's an issue for the grace story.

565
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,240
 The grace story finds its fullness

566
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,720
 in the glory story of him coming back.

567
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,760
 The God who came to you in grace

568
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,520
 is returning to you in glory.

569
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,640
 And as you begin to really wrestle

570
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,480
 with the wonder of a God who is grace

571
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,560
 at the start of my story and glory at the end of it,

572
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,560
 then everything in between begins to fall into place.

573
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,320
 It doesn't mean, like Paul to the church in Colossae,

574
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,720
 that everything's gonna work out perfect.

575
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,120
 Doesn't mean that suddenly my circumstances

576
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,240
 are all gonna be perfect.

577
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
 Doesn't mean that I'm gonna get that iPad for Christmas.

578
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,160
 She's not.

579
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,520
 What it does mean is that if I have Jesus at the start

580
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
 and I have Jesus at the end,

581
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,160
 then I can have Jesus right now.

582
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,880
 It means that I can have a relationship

583
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 with this blessed hope that can raise in my spirit

584
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,720
 something that is different from the doom and the gloom

585
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,760
 and the despair that I see in this world.

586
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,080
 And I can begin to live on behalf of a hope,

587
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,960
 a glorious hope that's coming in the here and now.

588
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,760
 It's like Jesus said, "I'm the alpha and the omega,

589
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
 the first and the last."

590
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,040
 What he's basically saying is,

591
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,640
 "If you have me at your start,

592
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,360
 and if you're gonna have me at your end,

593
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,760
 then you have nothing to worry about in between."

594
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,320
 Doesn't mean that everything's gonna be perfect for you.

595
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,640
 It's gonna be some challenges.

596
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,480
 It's gonna be tough.

597
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,320
 It's gonna be hard.

598
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,960
 You will not go through it alone.

599
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,800
 I am Emmanuel, God with you.

600
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,040
 I'm at your start.

601
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,360
 I'm at your end.

602
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,640
 Everything else is in between.

603
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,640
 And Paul says, "This is blessed."

604
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,720
 He's like, "Could you imagine the privilege

605
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,360
 that it is to live in this time?"

606
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,580
 Imagine a church that would say,

607
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,040
 "Isn't it such a privilege to live in a time

608
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,480
 when everybody is doom and gloom?"

609
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
 'Cause then I've got something to say.

610
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,200
 I've got a hope to speak of.

611
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,480
 I've got a light that can shine,

612
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,540
 and that light shines brightest

613
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,320
 when it's pretty dark out there.

614
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,440
 It's interesting because it's not just Paul

615
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,600
 that speaks this way.

616
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
 There are writers throughout the New Testament

617
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,600
 that hold this idea of hope being this caught between time

618
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,580
 of the beginning and the end and the joy it is to live now.

619
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,100
 Let me just jump out of Paul for a second,

620
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,260
 take you to 1 Peter,

621
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,460
 and the apostle Peter is speaking here

622
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,700
 about the same kind of thing Paul's speaking about.

623
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,740
 Let me read this to you from 1 Peter 1, verse 3.

624
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,580
 Praise be to the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ

625
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,060
 for in his great mercy, he has given to us,

626
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,300
 notice this, new birth into a living hope.

627
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,820
 Isn't that beautiful?

628
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,960
 Christ has given us this grace that's appeared,

629
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,800
 has given us this new birth into a living hope

630
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,240
 through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead

631
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,880
 and into an inheritance

632
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,980
 that can never perish, spoil, or fade,

633
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,960
 kept in heaven just for you,

634
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,120
 who through faith are shielded by God's power

635
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,480
 until the coming of the salvation

636
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,280
 that is ready to be revealed in the last time.

637
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,360
 Can you hear what Peter's saying here?

638
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,040
 It's so similar to what Paul's saying.

639
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,360
 In fact, let me just bring the two things side by side here

640
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,480
 so you can see them next to each other.

641
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,200
 Peter is speaking very similarly to Paul here.

642
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,760
 He's saying, look, we've got to understand

643
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,800
 that Christ has come and in his death and his resurrection,

644
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,420
 he started a new life.

645
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,680
 We, if we're in relationship with him,

646
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:41,360
 can have a new birth into what he calls a living hope.

647
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,480
 In other words, it's not just a hope

648
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,880
 that's anchored to the starting point of Christ in the past.

649
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 It's not just a hope that's for us

650
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,740
 in the future at some point.

651
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,040
 No, he's saying the hope has resonance today.

652
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,880
 The hope brings life and is alive in us right here and now.

653
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,360
 And he's saying that hope is becoming

654
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,200
 because of this inheritance we have in Christ

655
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,880
 that we will be shielded by the power of God

656
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,440
 until we get there on that day

657
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,220
 and we will realize that we are dressed

658
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,200
 in his righteousness alone,

659
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,160
 so we'll have confidence to stand before the throne.

660
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,640
 That's a living hope that actually has pay,

661
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,980
 payback to our lives right here and now.

662
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,100
 Paul writes the same thing in the Titus passage.

663
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,980
 Look at verse 12 here.

664
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,180
 He says, here's what this blessed hope does.

665
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,020
 It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions

666
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,140
 and to live a self-controlled, upright,

667
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,260
 and godly life in this present age.

668
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,740
 See, both Paul and Peter don't want you to think

669
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,940
 that hope was for the past and it's only for the future.

670
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,240
 They want you to realize that this hope is alive

671
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,880
 right here and right now.

672
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,200
 It's a living hope, it's a blessed hope,

673
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,080
 and when you get that hope, guess what?

674
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,360
 You have the ability to say no,

675
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,560
 to say no to exploitation that you see in the world,

676
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,060
 to say no to rampant consumerism,

677
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,880
 to say no to the injustices that you see,

678
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,680
 injustices out there, but also injustices in here.

679
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,480
 It enables me to say no to ungodly passions

680
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,160
 that come up within me.

681
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,480
 It enables me to be more self-controlled.

682
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,960
 It enables me that when my life doesn't go well,

683
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,200
 sure, I feel the pain of that, the hurt of that.

684
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,960
 I'm impacted by that.

685
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,920
 I want my life to go well, and when it doesn't,

686
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,560
 that hurts and it's difficult, but I can be self-controlled.

687
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,840
 I can begin to live in a way that actually puts

688
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,040
 the blessed hope of the past and the future

689
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,800
 right into work in the present right now.

690
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,760
 Could you imagine a church that is not confined

691
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,400
 to thinking that hope is uncertain and a curse,

692
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,640
 but that hope was alive and true

693
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,760
 and meant something right here in Hong Kong

694
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,920
 when so many people are crying out for hope?

695
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,200
 It's interesting to me because the hope

696
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,960
 that the world is speaking about, this societal hope,

697
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,160
 is so whimsical and such the power of positive thinking.

698
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,560
 And Paul's saying here, you need to understand

699
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,680
 that biblical hope is not the power of positive thinking.

700
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,720
 It's not thinking better about your life

701
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,040
 or thinking better about the future and going,

702
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,440
 I just hope things get better in the future.

703
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,240
 He's like, also, biblical hope is not naive.

704
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,340
 It's not the sort of hope that shuts its eyes

705
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,320
 to the problems of the world.

706
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,560
 It's not a hope that's trying to bury its head in the sand

707
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,000
 and kind of pretend like it doesn't really matter.

708
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,760
 Hope in the Bible is not gathering in a building like this

709
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,160
 and kind of cushioning ourselves from the evil in the world.

710
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,040
 That's not biblical hope.

711
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,880
 Biblical hope lights a fire inside of us

712
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,600
 to be able to live in a new and a fresh way,

713
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,280
 representing the heart of God

714
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
 in the darkness that's around us.

715
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,600
 Hope, biblically, is not shy about the pain

716
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,120
 and the suffering of this world.

717
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,820
 Hope welcomes us into the process of lament,

718
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,560
 where we lament together on what we're seeing

719
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,280
 in this now but not yet,

720
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,800
 longing for the time when glory will appear,

721
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,300
 grateful for the fact that grace has already come,

722
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,760
 living in the wonder between those two things

723
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
 and declaring to the world

724
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,560
 that there is a better day ahead.

725
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,720
 That's a beautiful thing.

726
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,960
 That's how I think Paul wanted his church to be.

727
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,080
 I think it's how God wants his church to be today.

728
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,240
 Christians should be the most hopeful people on the planet

729
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,280
 and in an hour like this,

730
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,640
 we should be rising up and finding our voice.

731
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,640
 It's important you understand that this sort of hope

732
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,300
 is what the Christmas story is all about.

733
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,460
 This is really interesting.

734
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,920
 I don't know if you've ever thought of the Christmas story

735
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,280
 by like stripping out all of the kind of like decorations

736
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
 and the gifts and the celebrations

737
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,160
 and the nice carols and all of that

738
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,540
 and just actually looked at the rawness

739
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,440
 of what Christmas is all about.

740
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,280
 At the very heart of it,

741
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,400
 the Christmas story is essentially a story

742
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,160
 of a teenage crisis pregnancy.

743
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,200
 It's a story of a young girl who finds herself pregnant

744
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,520
 without having ever slept with a man

745
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,960
 and the reality of the shame

746
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,400
 that that was gonna bring upon her and her fiance,

747
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,640
 the person that she was pledged to be married to

748
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,240
 but had not actually gotten married and had not had sex

749
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,200
 and suddenly she finds herself in a place of pregnancy

750
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,640
 which even today is a vulnerable thing

751
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,840
 but that was even more of a vulnerable thing back then.

752
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,500
 I mean, you can imagine almost the whispers

753
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
 of the people around them in Nazareth at the time,

754
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,180
 I told you that those two were getting together.

755
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,620
 I told you they were doing some dodgy stuff

756
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,600
 after that party last week.

757
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,760
 Look at what's happened.

758
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,260
 These guys are so ungodly, so broken, so horrible.

759
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,020
 So this is a story of a young girl who's done nothing wrong

760
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,980
 and has to live in the shame

761
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,320
 of everybody pointing her finger at her.

762
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,060
 Not only that, but she's pledged to be married

763
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,700
 to a working class man who's a carpenter

764
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,460
 who ends up actually living

765
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,820
 and they're living in a small town in a small country

766
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,820
 that's under oppression by a major dominant empire.

767
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,980
 Not only that, but their freedoms are not their own.

768
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,540
 We hear in the story that if her pregnancy

769
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,480
 and the shame of that was not worse enough,

770
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,900
 they didn't have to uproot themselves

771
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,860
 and move to another place that they did not know

772
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,380
 although it was the fiance's family home

773
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,000
 in this place called Bethlehem.

774
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,020
 They didn't know it, but they had to go there

775
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,620
 because a census was taking place.

776
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,440
 And when they got there, here was their hope.

777
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,580
 Their hope was that family members that lived there

778
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,420
 of the fiance would open their doors to them

779
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,660
 and welcome them in because she was heavenly pregnant.

780
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,100
 And they get there and guess what happens?

781
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,060
 Their very flesh and blood,

782
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,500
 their relatives refused to let them in

783
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,660
 even though I'm sure they had plenty of space

784
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,980
 in their own homes because they didn't want

785
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,700
 to be associated with the shame

786
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,200
 of an unmarried pregnant teenage girl.

787
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,940
 Oh, we talk about it like there was no room in the inn.

788
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,340
 The reality is none of the family would let them in.

789
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,940
 And so they have to go to this cave.

790
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,080
 Mangers, again, on the Hallmark Christmas cards

791
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,260
 look so pretty and nice and clean, don't they?

792
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,140
 They were basically caves that happened

793
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,660
 under the houses themselves where the animals

794
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,160
 would be to stay warm in winter under the house.

795
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,020
 So literally Mary and Joseph go to a cave,

796
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,180
 a dark, damp place, and they have their child there.

797
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,900
 And you could imagine for the mother

798
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,700
 that this was not how she had planned anything to be.

799
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,420
 This is not circumstances how she wanted it to be.

800
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,340
 But she brings her child into the world

801
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,780
 in less than perfect circumstances.

802
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,440
 But she has this audacious thought

803
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,620
 that her child was special.

804
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,460
 And she believed that the location of his birth

805
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,160
 did not determine his destiny or his future.

806
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,220
 And really the rawness of the Christmas story

807
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:58,380
 tells us this, that no matter how bleak

808
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,440
 circumstances might seem, even though the bad guys

809
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,540
 are currently in power, even though winners

810
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,400
 are lording it over losers, even though even family members

811
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,160
 are rejecting you and hurting you,

812
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,500
 that anything that's happening right now is not permanent.

813
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,620
 That God is able to bring his child and his presence

814
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,020
 into the midst of that right here and now.

815
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,220
 And Emmanuel, God with us, can change everything.

816
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,100
 If the Christmas story is anything, it's a story of hope.

817
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,020
 Hope in the darkest of circumstances.

818
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,520
 That's a story that the world needs to hear again.

819
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,280
 And the church carries with it, in its heart,

820
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,340
 that story of hope.

821
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,420
 That all of us have been marked by that story,

822
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,280
 that we all realize that we're a dark, damp cave,

823
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,620
 if you will, but if Jesus can be born in Bethlehem,

824
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,740
 he can certainly be born in the coldness of my heart.

825
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,380
 That he can come and make new life and new home in me.

826
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,100
 That the place of that birth in me

827
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,900
 can make me into a living hope.

828
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,820
 A hope that now stands before the world

829
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,540
 and says the story of Jesus in his grace

830
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,660
 and the story of his coming in his glory

831
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,980
 is the story that I want my life to represent.

832
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,020
 No matter how difficult things might be around us,

833
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,660
 I want my life to speak of something better

834
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,940
 than what is currently seen.

835
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,740
 See, Jesus would go on to inaugurate his kingdom

836
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,100
 and he would teach what that kingdom would look like,

837
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,140
 turning everything upside down from the doom and gloom

838
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,980
 that's seen in the world.

839
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,520
 He would teach that the first would be last,

840
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,700
 that the last would be first.

841
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,140
 He would teach that the lowly would be lifted up

842
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,220
 and that the hungry would be fed.

843
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,700
 Isn't that beautiful?

844
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,500
 He taught that those who are mighty right now

845
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,460
 would be thrown off their thrones

846
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,220
 and that the proud would be scattered in their thoughts.

847
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,320
 He taught actually that it would be the meek

848
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,020
 that would inherit the earth,

849
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,340
 not those with guns or power.

850
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,100
 He said that those who are mourning right now,

851
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,500
 who are overwhelmed by a diagnosis,

852
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,300
 who are wondering when they're gonna get that job,

853
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,300
 who are wondering what purpose they have for being here,

854
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,060
 who are struggling with the depths

855
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,240
 of the things that are there,

856
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,440
 the realities of their life,

857
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,860
 that even those that are really struggling right now,

858
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,180
 they will be comforted, he said.

859
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,260
 And Jesus starts this story

860
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,660
 because he's birthing new living hope in his people

861
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,580
 and he wants his church to stand on behalf of that.

862
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,740
 You've gotta understand that this is hope.

863
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,660
 The idea that we believe in the coming vision

864
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,100
 of the kingdom to come and we live on behalf of it now.

865
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,740
 This is hope, that even though we're surrounded

866
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,800
 by some of that story of suffering and pain,

867
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,700
 we realize that we can bear witness today

868
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,120
 to the power of our God to bring salvation

869
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,480
 and bring justice and bring healing

870
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,580
 and bring liberation to those that need it.

871
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,160
 This is hope, that even though we're surrounded right now

872
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,400
 by the story of death, the story of life

873
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,820
 can still make its voice heard,

874
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,040
 that we might join with Martin Luther King Jr.

875
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,320
 and say that we're gonna carve a little stone of hope

876
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,900
 out of the mountain of despair.

877
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,680
 This is hope and it's hope not because we're better

878
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
 or we've done something or we've earned it,

879
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,420
 it's hope because it's found in the person

880
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,480
 that Christmas speaks of, this Jesus,

881
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,240
 all loving, all good, all personable, present here,

882
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,540
 the Emmanuel, God with us, walking beside us,

883
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,960
 living for us, inaugurating the kingdom,

884
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,280
 paying the price for our sin,

885
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,520
 raising from the death, coming together,

886
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,320
 now coming in his glory at the end of all things

887
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,360
 and we stand in the middle and we say,

888
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,640
 what a time to be alive.

889
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,120
 This is hope.

890
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,560
 We have something to offer the world

891
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,800
 in the pain that it's in.

892
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,400
 And here's what that hope should do in and for us.

893
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,360
 It should give us a divinely inspired urgency

894
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,480
 to live like Jesus.

895
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,000
 The hunger and thirst for righteousness,

896
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,560
 to decide that we're going to move out of passive comfort

897
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,000
 and into costly solidarity with the poor

898
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,040
 and the broken and the vulnerable.

899
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,240
 This kind of hope challenges us,

900
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,680
 that we should persevere when life takes a hard turn,

901
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,600
 when the news comes against us and the diagnosis is present

902
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,800
 and the job isn't there, whatever it is,

903
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,880
 when life is so pulling against us

904
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,360
 that we have this ability to persevere,

905
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,840
 even though we of course long for a change

906
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,560
 in our circumstance, that we join with Paul

907
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,080
 and we say, I've learned the secret of being content

908
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,560
 no matter what happens because my trust

909
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,960
 and my ultimate hope is not found

910
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
 in some change of circumstance,

911
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,720
 it's found in the grace and the glory

912
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,080
 of the one that I love.

913
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,400
 That I might find myself lifted out of myself

914
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,680
 and towards hope again.

915
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,680
 I think this hope teaches us that those who hope

916
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,360
 in the Lord will renew their strength,

917
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,760
 that they will rise up on wings like eagles,

918
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,120
 that they will run and not grow weary.

919
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,780
 This sort of hope shows us, teaches us, empowers us

920
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:31,560
 to understand that we can be steadfast in this life,

921
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,720
 that when opposition comes to the things that we believe

922
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
 and think about, that when oppression comes

923
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
 to the church body as a whole,

924
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,960
 that when we're facing perhaps in some years ahead here,

925
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,920
 some of the challenges to how we think

926
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,040
 or some of the challenges to what we believe,

927
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,880
 we can find a living hope within us

928
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,760
 that produces within us a steadfastness

929
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,960
 to stand against whatever power of oppression may come,

930
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,240
 that we would join with scripture and say,

931
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,880
 we might be hard pressed on every side,

932
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,760
 but we are not crushed.

933
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,920
 We might be perplexed, but we are not in despair.

934
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,520
 We might be persecuted, but we're not abandoned.

935
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,840
 We might be knocked down, but we are not crushed

936
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,120
 because there is a living hope within us.

937
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,320
 And I think this living hope does this.

938
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,300
 I think it makes us begin to reimagine a world today

939
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,760
 that might look like the one that is to come,

940
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,400
 knowing that not until when Jesus gets back

941
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,480
 will it ever be the way it truly should be.

942
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,400
 We're not gonna see perfection here

943
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,140
 in the right here and now,

944
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,160
 but we can look towards that vision and say,

945
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,120
 I wanna think about and begin to build a society today

946
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,920
 where everybody has dignity, everybody is loved,

947
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
 where everybody has right opportunity,

948
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,800
 where everybody feels the hope and the comfort

949
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,640
 and the love of an all loving father,

950
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,260
 where exploitation is spoken about and dealt with,

951
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,640
 where hate is spoken out against and dealt with,

952
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,240
 where we actually begin to align our values

953
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,440
 with the things that we know is on the heart of God

954
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,960
 and we produce something within us

955
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,260
 that says something hopeful to the world.

956
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,880
 That's a church I think many people

957
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,120
 would wanna be a part of.

958
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,080
 May we find our voice.

959
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,320
 And I wanna give you some homework

960
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,560
 to help you to do that in the week ahead.

961
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,260
 Get out your phones, take a photo of this slide right now.

962
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,720
 In general, would you describe yourself

963
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,200
 as hopeful person or not?

964
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,380
 Why or why not?

965
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,160
 Number two, where currently in your life have you lost hope?

966
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,000
 Why do you think this might be the case?

967
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,400
 Number three, biblical hope is rooted

968
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,500
 in both grace and glory.

969
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,160
 Which of these might be lacking more

970
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,520
 in your current understanding of hope?

971
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,700
 And then finally four,

972
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,860
 biblical hope is not only future focused,

973
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,100
 but a living hope that invites us to bear witness

974
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,920
 to God's kingdom in the here and now.

975
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,880
 So where do you sense the Holy Spirit

976
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,720
 is inviting you to do this in your life?

977
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,280
 And what might that look like?

978
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,960
 Paul writes this beautiful thing to the church in Rome

979
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,960
 when he's talking to them about hope and a living hope.

980
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,080
 He says these beautiful words.

981
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,400
 He says this, he says,

982
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,840
 and this is kind of like his prayer for the church.

983
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,320
 He's like, "May the hope of the Lord,

984
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,300
 "the Lord of all hope,

985
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,420
 "may he birth this joy and grace within you

986
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,220
 "as you trust in him,

987
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,900
 "so that you might overflow with hope

988
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,400
 "by the power of the Holy Spirit."

989
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,280
 And if there was ever a prayer on my heart

990
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,980
 for us as a church community

991
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,040
 at a time of hope crisis in the world,

992
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,680
 where despair seems to be so commonly spoken about,

993
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,160
 that we might actually be the ones who overflow with hope,

994
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,300
 because the power of the Holy Spirit.

995
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,120
 The hope isn't in us.

996
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,440
 The hope isn't in uncertainty.

997
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,120
 It's certainly not in some better positive thinking.

998
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,320
 It's certainly not in some change in circumstance.

999
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,900
 Our hope only is in the grace and the glory of Jesus Christ.

1000
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,040
 I hope that's been hopeful for you.

1001
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,240
 Can we pray?

1002
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,080
 Let's pray.

1003
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:13,400
 Father, I'm just so grateful for the people in this room

1004
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,480
 who carry within them a living hope.

1005
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,580
 And Lord, we recognize that the church is often quiet,

1006
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,400
 that we do so often define hope just like society does.

1007
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,880
 And because we define hope that way,

1008
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,560
 we don't talk about it very much.

1009
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,880
 Hope is an embarrassment rather than a badge of honor.

1010
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,720
 Father, we come to you now in this moment,

1011
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,320
 thankful that Paul and Peter and others

1012
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,880
 can help us to reimagine and reconnect

1013
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,120
 to what blessed hope, living hope looks like.

1014
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,120
 A hope that's not focused on our strength,

1015
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,640
 our goodness, having it all together.

1016
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,580
 A hope that's untethered from the changes of circumstance

1017
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,540
 as much as we may long for them.

1018
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:13,320
 A hope that is found in the unchanging,

1019
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,900
 loving and purposeful arms of the Father.

1020
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,720
 Father, I pray for people in this room

1021
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,120
 who maybe came in today and they've been weighed down

1022
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,720
 by brokenness in their past.

1023
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,000
 Maybe something's happened to them, no fault of their own,

1024
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,600
 but something happened to them in their past

1025
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,240
 and they're still carrying the trauma with that today.

1026
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,320
 Or perhaps in their past,

1027
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,920
 they went through some really difficult times

1028
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,620
 because of some choices they made.

1029
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,040
 Maybe some mistakes, things that they regret,

1030
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,980
 perhaps even some sin that they wrestled with

1031
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,640
 that led to some pretty poor choices

1032
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,360
 and some harsh circumstances.

1033
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,440
 Father, if anybody's come in today with a pain

1034
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,560
 when it comes to their past,

1035
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,000
 Lord, I thank you that you spoke to us of hope

1036
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,800
 that's founded in grace today.

1037
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,040
 And Lord, I wanna pray for anyone

1038
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,760
 where that's a reality for them in this moment,

1039
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,400
 that Lord, your spirit would minister them right now

1040
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,920
 in a place of hope,

1041
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,800
 that your grace would fall upon them again

1042
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,800
 and that grace would remind them

1043
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,880
 that they are forgiven from that brokenness,

1044
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,720
 forgiven from the mistakes they made,

1045
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,680
 forgiven from the sin of the past,

1046
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,160
 forgiven and wiped clean

1047
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,240
 that what was before a stain before you

1048
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,760
 is now white as snow.

1049
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,400
 Lord, those that are struggling from a trauma in the past

1050
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,000
 that was not their fault,

1051
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,400
 I pray that your grace would cover that multitude

1052
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,360
 for them as well.

1053
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,600
 I pray that your grace would reach into the depths

1054
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,680
 of where they're at

1055
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,520
 and begin that process of healing and renewal and life.

1056
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,760
 Lord, anyone where they're broken by their past,

1057
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,840
 Lord, we pray for the hope that is found

1058
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,240
 in the grace of Christ.

1059
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,480
 Lord, for those in this room

1060
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,240
 that are really worried about the future,

1061
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,040
 Lord, where they're anxious about what's ahead,

1062
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,920
 maybe their health gives them a bad picture of what's ahead.

1063
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,120
 Maybe the lack of a job and the pressures of finance

1064
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,960
 gives them a stress and anxiety about what's ahead.

1065
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,320
 Maybe they're looking for that full life relationship,

1066
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,440
 that person they're gonna spend

1067
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,480
 the rest of their life with

1068
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,320
 and that person hasn't come along yet

1069
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,240
 and they're wondering if it ever will.

1070
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,040
 Father, for those in this room

1071
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,160
 that are anxious about their future,

1072
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,000
 Lord, I wanna pray for the hope

1073
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,360
 that is founded in the glory of Christ Jesus.

1074
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,440
 The hope that is found in the sure fact

1075
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,800
 that Jesus is returning to this world again.

1076
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,560
 And when he does, all brokenness is dealt with,

1077
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,320
 sin is gone, death no more.

1078
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,720
 That there is healing and restoration for all,

1079
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,600
 that all things are made new.

1080
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,400
 That when we live in the beauty of the glory

1081
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,800
 of the return of Christ,

1082
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,480
 it releases us from the anxieties of what we think is ahead

1083
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,240
 'cause what ahead is good.

1084
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,560
 So Lord, I pray for anyone

1085
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,480
 who's struggling with their future,

1086
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,960
 that the glory that is found in the living hope today

1087
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,920
 would restore them.

1088
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,720
 And Lord, for us in this moment,

1089
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,080
 for us in the now that we're a part of,

1090
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,840
 Father, would your Holy Spirit come?

1091
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,120
 Would the God of hope bring joy and peace to this moment?

1092
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:29,160
 And perhaps if you're receiving this word today

1093
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,520
 as our eyes are closed, you just wanna open your hands.

1094
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,640
 It's just a simple way of just symbolizing before the Lord

1095
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,000
 that you wanna respond now

1096
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,480
 to the ministry of the Spirit of God upon you.

1097
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,960
 And I believe for some of you now in this moment,

1098
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,320
 maybe it's been a while since you felt joy and peace.

1099
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:54,520
 It's been a while since you felt true hope.

1100
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:00,600
 I wanna pray that the God of hope

1101
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,520
 would pour out joy and peace

1102
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,760
 and cause you to overflow with hope

1103
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,640
 through the power of the Holy Spirit.

1104
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,280
 So Holy Spirit, would you come?

1105
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,200
 And would you come and minister in this way right now?

1106
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,880
 Lord, for those people whose hands are open before you here,

1107
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,120
 would your Holy Spirit begin the joy and the peace

1108
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,000
 and the renewed life that is found in the grace

1109
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,640
 and the glory of Christ Jesus

1110
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,200
 and the living hope that is made true now?

1111
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:38,160
 I pray that you just receive the ministry of the Spirit.

1112
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,400
 Our choir are gonna now respond and sing over us,

1113
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,440
 but I wanna encourage you just to keep your eyes closed,

1114
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,080
 resist the urge to film it on your camera,

1115
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,240
 resist the urge to move from this moment.

1116
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,640
 This is a very important moment for most of you right now.

1117
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,280
 So as your eyes are closed, as your hands are open,

1118
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,440
 allow the lyrics of this song and the ministry of the choir

1119
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,960
 to facilitate what the Holy Spirit is doing in you.

1120
