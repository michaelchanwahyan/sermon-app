[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Amen.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.920]   Let's look at this first picture.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.340]   This is Immaculée Ilebagiza.
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.200]   In 1994, she was a university student in Rwanda.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.260]   During the Rwanda genocide,
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.460]   the genocide found its way to her village.
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.320]   During this time, a pastor grabbed Immaculée
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.700]   and seven other women and hid them in his en suite bathroom.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.540]   It was a small room, four foot by three foot.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.300]   He moved his dresser to hide the door,
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.440]   and it was there they stayed for 91 days
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.200]   in order to survive the genocide.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.060]   After the genocide was over,
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.420]   Immaculée found herself standing in front of the very person
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.680]   who killed her own mother and her brothers.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.020]   And she said the words, "I forgive you."
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.340]   She later went on to be an advocate for reconciliation,
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.060]   going on to speak all over the world.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.140]   And when asked about this encounter
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.380]   with this man who murdered her family, she said this,
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.120]   "I believe that we can heal Rwanda and our world
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.880]   "by healing one heart at a time."
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.020]   This next photo was taken in 1983.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.200]   This is Pope John Paul II
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.340]   visiting Mehmet Ali Aksa in his jail cell.
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.620]   Two years before this, Mehmet attempted
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.420]   to assassinate the pope,
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.660]   shooting at him multiple rounds in St. Peter's Square.
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.160]   Two of those bullets hit the pope.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.900]   While suffering severe blood loss,
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.400]   the pope was able to survive.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.980]   He made a full recovery, and when he was able to,
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.580]   about a year and a half later,
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.640]   he decided to go visit Mehmet in his jail cell
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.860]   to offer him forgiveness face to face.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.360]   This was the picture of that conversation.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.700]   27 years after this conversation,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.020]   it was the pope himself who advocated for Mehmet
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.660]   to be pardoned and released from jail.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.400]   In fact, at the end of his life, near the end of his life,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.560]   Mehmet was quoted as saying, "The pope is my friend.
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.200]   "The very man he tried to kill."
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.840]   This next photo is a picture of me with my own son.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.880]   I had the rare opportunity to spend a full day with him
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.300]   as my elder son was going on a school trip,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.080]   so we were planning what to do,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.460]   and he only asked for one thing,
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.800]   "Take me to Universal Studios."
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.240]   And I was like, at this point,
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.600]   we were in Singapore for about three years now,
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.660]   so we've been many times, okay?
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.360]   Universal Studios in Singapore is not even that big,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.480]   especially when one of the major areas being renovated,
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.880]   so I was like, "Buddy, we've gone a lot,
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.460]   "it's very expensive, let's do something else."
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.700]   I see some people, "Pfft."
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.360]   Visibly sad, my son gives me a hug,
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.560]   and he says, "It's okay, Dad."
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.440]   Now, my son's 10, okay?
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.500]   I didn't know he knew verse psychology.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.100]   I didn't know that he accessed Jedi mind trick powers,
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.060]   but where was that picture taken?
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.320]   Universal Studios.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.160]   On the Transformers ride.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.680]   Forgiveness has the power to change a country.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.280]   Forgiveness has the power to change a man.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.680]   Forgiveness has the power to change people's decisions,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.920]   and in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.180]   forgiveness has the power to change history.
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.440]   Today, I'll be continuing our forgiveness sermon series,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.000]   and I'll be looking at the more practical side
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.240]   of what forgiveness is.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.800]   Why don't you join me as I pray before we really start?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.840]   Jesus, let the words of my mouth
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.320]   and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.780]   O Lord, my rock and redeemer.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.420]   Amen, amen.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.800]   Right, as introduced, I am super excited
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.560]   to be back here at the Vine.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.600]   So yes, I know some of you, but I don't know a lot of you,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.440]   so I do wanna introduce myself again.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.600]   Yes, my name is Derek, I'm based in Singapore.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.320]   I work for a company called Momenta Group,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.680]   and I primarily function as an executive coach
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.720]   and a corporate trainer, and more recently,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.660]   I'm in charge of our sales team in Singapore.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.100]   I had a lot more to say about this,
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.440]   but Ellison told me, "Stop talking
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.760]   "about all this stuff that you do."
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.300]   Sorry that I have a job after pastoring.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.640]   Jeez.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.000]   He's praying for me to not be successful
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.600]   so I can come back to the Vine.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.640]   Anyway, so yes, I was a pastor, though,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.520]   and that's more relevant to everyone here today.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.040]   From 2003 to 2010, I had the honor of pastoring
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.320]   our young adults at 180, and a lot of the people
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.360]   that I pastored then are currently in leadership
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.800]   here at this church, and it's an honor
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.000]   to see a lot of you here still now.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.200]   2010, 2014, I went to seminary.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.240]   Yes, I served as a pastor, and then I went to seminary.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.100]   That's kinda how we rolled back then at the Vine.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.480]   Not anymore, not anymore.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.880]   I guarantee you we're different now.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.360]   2014, I returned to serve under a young man
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.560]   named Andrew Gardner and help pastor this church,
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.160]   and I joined with Pastor Carlo
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.720]   to form the pastoral leadership team.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.640]   In 2019, I felt the Lord called me to focus primarily
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.720]   on executive coaching and corporate training,
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.160]   so that's when I was last here to speak here.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.560]   So I have a deep, deep history with this church.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.840]   This is my home church.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.360]   In fact, in February 2001, I became a Christian
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.040]   at my very first Vine service, so this is home to me.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.880]   You all are home to me, and I celebrate you all
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.640]   from Singapore, and it is an honor to be back.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.440]   So pastoral team, oh, not pastoral, all right,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.400]   Carlo and Allison, thank you for having me back.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.680]   And of course, Andrew, I just wanna say
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.420]   I love you and I miss you.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.320]   We're doing fine.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.240]   Don't worry about us.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.440]   I know he's gonna watch to make sure I'm
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.760]   preaching from the Bible and all that stuff.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.800]   So, hi, Andrew.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.440]   Okay, so let's get going.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.120]   So for those of you that need it,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.720]   I'm gonna just share a roadmap for what I'm gonna do,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.800]   'cause some people really, ah, what are we talking about?
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.640]   Where are we?
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.760]   So I'm gonna look at what is forgiveness.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.860]   I'm gonna look at what is not forgiveness.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.160]   I'm gonna talk about why we should forgive,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.240]   how do we forgive, and then I'm gonna do
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.320]   a kind of a now what at the end, okay?
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.240]   So this is our roadmap.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.060]   This is where we're gonna go.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.400]   So firstly, what is forgiveness?
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.100]   And before I start this in earnest,
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.240]   my mandate was to not give the kind of
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.360]   biblical foundation of forgiveness.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.880]   Pastor Promise did that last week,
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.200]   and if you haven't done that,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.280]   please go listen to it if you haven't done so.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.800]   And if you are wondering, Promise,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   when I was, Promise came to us as an intern.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.160]   He came onto my team.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.560]   He's not here, so I can talk about him.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.560]   So he now has taken my role, my title, and my haircut.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.760]   So, you know, just give him some love.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.000]   He's wondering if it's a midlife crisis.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.960]   It absolutely is.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.600]   So just help pray for your pastors.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.200]   They need it.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.640]   So please listen to that sermon if you haven't done so.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.560]   That's the biblical understanding.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.800]   So I'm going to give more of a practical one.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.720]   So, and from apart from scripture
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.480]   and our shared experience as believers,
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.160]   there's actually been a lot of academic research
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.420]   on forgiveness, and really, it's incredible
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.360]   what the transformative power of forgiveness is.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.320]   And before we get into that part,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.680]   I must say that I am not a therapist, okay?
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.600]   I'm not actually a certified therapist,
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.200]   but what I am is I have over 13 years
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.400]   of pastoral experience and in counseling.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.280]   I also am a certified executive coach since 2011,
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.420]   and I myself have been through years of counseling.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.800]   So I come at it from a type of practitioner,
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.920]   and I'm also a client, you know?
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.420]   So I have a lot of experience in this.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.200]   So let's look at what forgiveness is.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.920]   The American Psychological Association, the APA,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.800]   puts it like this, and I really want you
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.960]   to open your mind to what the secular,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.160]   clinical description is.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.000]   It's fascinating.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.360]   Let's look at what forgiveness is.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.720]   Forgiveness involves willfully putting aside
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.200]   feelings of resentment towards someone
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.460]   who has committed a wrong, been unfair,
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.600]   or hurtful, or otherwise harmed you in some way.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.120]   Forgiveness is not merely accepting what happened
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.720]   or ceasing to be angry.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.560]   Rather, it involves a voluntary transformation
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   of your feelings, attitude, and behavior
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.400]   so that you are no longer dominated by resentment
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.740]   and can express compassion, generosity, or the like
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.440]   toward the person who wronged you.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.000]   This is the clinical description of what forgiveness is.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.640]   So if you break this down, there is a lot happening, right?
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.520]   Here, you have to willingfully decide,
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.480]   I am going to put aside resentment, right?
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.560]   I am going to decide to willfully put that aside.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.360]   It's not just stopping to be angry.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.040]   There is a decision that I was being full of resentment
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.760]   and anger, but now I'm not going to access that anymore.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.900]   But then there's the second part of transforming
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.180]   those feelings, and attitudes, and behaviors
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.180]   into something else, compassion, generosity, and the like.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:42.640]   So forgiveness, there's this both internal transformation,
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.000]   but there's also an external one as well.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.320]   There's a lot happening in this phrase
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.220]   that we say to forgive someone.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.980]   And actually, in my preparation, I came across a number
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.040]   of different adaptations of this,
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.780]   and for today's purposes, I came across another one
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.280]   which I think you'll find very interesting.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.500]   There are two therapists, Enright and Fitzgibbons,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.800]   and they wrote a book, "Forgiveness Therapy,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.520]   "An Empirical Guide for Resolving Anger and Restoring Hope."
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.080]   Fascinating title, and I'm working my way through this book.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.860]   But I want you to hear their definition of forgiveness.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:24.840]   A willingness to abandon one's right to resentment,
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.960]   negative judgment, and indifferent behavior
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.820]   towards the one who unjustly injured us,
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:36.820]   while fostering the undeserved qualities
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.280]   of compassion, generosity, and even love.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:50.040]   A willingness to abandon resentment,
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.240]   negative judgment, and indifference.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.220]   That phrase is powerful, because if you've ever been hurt,
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.120]   if you've been abused, if evil has been done to you,
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.880]   you have an internal right to access things like anger,
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.280]   frustration, right?
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.320]   If that has been done to me, especially if it was unjust,
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.640]   then surely, internally, I can be angry.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.240]   I could even want justice, maybe even revenge.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.380]   That's my right, 'cause it was done to me.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.080]   But in therapy, I love this definition,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.880]   'cause it's saying, yes, you have that right,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.660]   but you are willing to abandon that right.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.620]   That you are saying, I am no longer going to access
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.120]   this frustration, this anger, this pain, this revenge.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.240]   And then, not just not access this,
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   but then I'm going to now transform.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.800]   And I love this phrase, I'm gonna foster this thing,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.520]   and it says this, the undeserved qualities.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.780]   It's not deserved.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.520]   But I choose to offer it anyway.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.680]   You know what this is?
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.120]   I don't know if Enright and Fitzgibbons are Christian,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.000]   but I think they stumbled on a beautiful,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.920]   secular description of what grace is.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.600]   This is a beautiful description.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.640]   I am no longer gonna access that resentment,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.800]   and I'm gonna transform and foster
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.000]   something completely undeserved.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.760]   Compassion, generosity.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.360]   I love that, I love seeing this.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.600]   I was so struck,
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.300]   because I felt that this was
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.960]   the gospel being explained to me.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:35.200]   True forgiveness, then, is both an internal transformation
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.840]   and an outward change of feelings,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.140]   attitudes, words, and behaviors.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.520]   It is a both/and.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.680]   There are two things happening, my internal world
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.040]   and what's happening in my external world, too.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.760]   Not my words, this is the clinical definition.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.860]   So if that's the case, then,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.180]   if this is what forgiveness is,
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.660]   well, then we can talk about what forgiveness isn't.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.480]   And I'll say this, forgiveness is not just saying the words,
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.320]   I forgive you, right?
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.280]   It's not just saying, nah, I forgive you,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.080]   or in today's world, just send the text, I forgive you.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.320]   And that's not it, because what we read there
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.920]   is that there is an internal transformation
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.600]   and an external change as well.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.880]   So it cannot just be words.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.920]   And if any of you work with teenagers,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.280]   you can see how someone could say something
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.440]   like I forgive you or I'm sorry, and not mean it.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.220]   I have a teenage boy, when I catch them fighting
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.160]   with my other son and I make him apologize,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.600]   I can tell he doesn't mean it.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.720]   That's not what true forgiveness is, right?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.040]   There has to be both an internal and external change.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.400]   There's another phrase that you hear a lot,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.440]   oh, just to forgive and forget.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.360]   Let's just forgive and move on.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.980]   And you know, I fundamentally disagree with that.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.280]   Because you know what, even Jesus, in his resurrected body,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.800]   he did not cleanse his body of the scars, right?
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.760]   You ever think about that?
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.140]   He went to Thomas, put your hand on my scar, feel it,
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.260]   because that proves I have overcome death.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.300]   See, if Jesus didn't remove his scars,
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.120]   I know why I still have mine.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.860]   'Cause I can say, look at the power of Jesus
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.920]   through my scars.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.720]   So it's not about just removing these thoughts,
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.820]   it's about addressing them and saying,
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.900]   because of the love and power of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.340]   I stand healed.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.760]   So no, it's not about forgetting.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.900]   And this last one really triggers me.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.340]   'Cause people, I've actually been in a coaching situation
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.440]   where someone said, I'm not gonna forgive,
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.980]   because I don't wanna be seen to be taken advantage of.
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.120]   I don't wanna be weak.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.280]   And when I hear that, there's something inside me
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.980]   that breaks because of the situations
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.520]   I've been a part of in my life.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.380]   Now before I move on, this is a trigger warning.
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.580]   I'm about to talk about death by drunk driving
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.240]   and sexual abuse.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.980]   If you feel that you cannot be here for this conversation
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.220]   or that you need to take an exit,
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.500]   please go ahead, take a bathroom break, take a walk,
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.860]   come back in a few minutes.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.700]   Thank you.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:32.500]   When I hear this phrase, to forgive is to be weak,
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.760]   I think about when I was in university.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.300]   I was a first year in University of Michigan,
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.660]   which is in 1997, for those of you
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.060]   who wanna know how old I am.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.460]   And it was the middle of winter,
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.980]   so it was snowy on the ground, and my friend is a Korean.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.340]   And in Korean American culture especially,
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.740]   as soon as Koreans hang out,
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.340]   they understand immediately who's older, right?
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.700]   And they have this concept of hyun,
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.180]   which is the older brother, older student,
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.540]   and there's a respect factor.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.740]   And the older sibling, the older person
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.060]   is supposed to kind of protect the younger person.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.640]   So this is hyun, you're my elder, take care of me.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.780]   So these guys, I wasn't with them,
[00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.860]   but these guys were drinking,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.260]   and they were having a great time.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.660]   And the hyun, the older student says to my friend,
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.900]   "Hey, we need to get some cigarettes,
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.340]   "we're out of cigarettes."
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.460]   So he's like, "Okay."
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.740]   Jumped in the car, drove off.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.380]   Middle of the night, they were drinking,
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.580]   snow on the ground.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:34.420]   Sure enough, that's elder student skid off the road,
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.520]   smashed into a tree.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.480]   It was later reported because of the seatbelt,
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.280]   the driver sustained minor issues,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.320]   but my friend was not wearing a seatbelt.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.900]   Flew right through their windshield.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.840]   I'll spare you the details,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.040]   but he was later declared dead at the scene.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.840]   Two days later was the funeral.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.780]   And when my friend's mom came face to face
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.060]   with the driver of that car,
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.660]   she just broke and sobbed.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.940]   And she went to this young man,
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.940]   and she just kept hitting him like this,
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.220]   thumping on his chest.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.920]   And she was yelling something in Korean,
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.760]   and I turned to my Korean friends,
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.600]   "What is she saying?"
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.660]   And she was saying, "You were supposed to protect him!
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.500]   "You were supposed to protect him!
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.180]   "Because he's hyun, he's the oldest."
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.140]   And she just kept hitting him,
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.740]   and it was just this gut-wrenching moment
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.600]   where we were all just watching.
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.860]   And eventually she ran out of energy,
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.600]   and then she just hugged this man,
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.660]   and just continued to sob into his chest.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:51.280]   "You're gonna tell me that this woman was weak
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.260]   "to extend just that little bit of forgiveness
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.860]   "to this person who just accidentally killed her son?
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.300]   "No, no way.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.360]   "That was the most incredible example of strength
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.560]   "I could ever think of."
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.140]   As a pastor, I've literally stood with a person
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.580]   who has experienced sexual abuse in their life,
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.900]   and they decide to, in prayer,
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.820]   forgive the person who abused them.
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.420]   And then this person was gripping their fists so tight,
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.620]   tears streaming, and their whole body was tense,
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.580]   and they uttered the word, "I forgive them."
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.140]   Is that weakness?
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.560]   It is the most powerful, strongest thing
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.980]   you could possibly do.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.660]   To forgive is no weakness.
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.200]   It is powerful.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   So what's actually happening when you forgive?
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.900]   What's going on, both internally, what's happening?
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.740]   What is the process?
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.000]   Why should we even do this?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.100]   Let me give you the academic research, okay?
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.480]   Look, I'm not a therapist,
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.940]   but I wanted you to see all of the research
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.920]   that I brought here.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.120]   And when I say research, I do mean Chat GPT,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.560]   in case you're wondering.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.120]   I told you that I'm not a therapist.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.160]   You're all wondering, as soon as I put this up,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.300]   yes, it is Chat GPT,
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.660]   but I did at least check these resources.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.500]   Come on now.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.360]   But look at this list.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.640]   Reduce blood pressure.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.920]   Lower stress levels.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.120]   Improved heart health.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.380]   Reduce chronic pain.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.800]   Better sleep quality.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.380]   Improved immune function.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.740]   Lower risk of heart attack.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.220]   These are all proven by academic research.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.680]   This is what happens when we forgive.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   So this list alone should be great reasons
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.220]   why we forgive, right?
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.460]   There's so many amazing benefits.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.760]   Yet we don't.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.060]   Right?
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.400]   Okay, maybe you're not a therapist.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.540]   Maybe you don't do research,
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.160]   but maybe you can anecdotally also prove this.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.000]   Think about it like this.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.680]   Think about the opposite.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.580]   Let's say you've been abused.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.920]   Let's say you've experienced some evil.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.040]   Something has happened where you hold this resentment,
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.620]   this anger, this bitterness,
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.280]   and instead of releasing it in forgiveness,
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.500]   you put it inside you and you carry it.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.500]   What is that gonna do to you over time?
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.020]   Think about the stress that you're gonna live with.
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.940]   Think about how your quality of sleep
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.620]   is gonna be impacted, right?
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.600]   All of these things we know
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.580]   because probably many of us experience this.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.340]   So you can appreciate this research
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.080]   because we know the opposite.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.900]   And maybe you're experiencing exactly that right now.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.700]   If you live a life of forgiveness,
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.240]   we know from the research it increases your health
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.880]   and your quality of life.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.460]   That's not me.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.140]   That's the research.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.980]   But why don't we do this?
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.540]   Because it's so difficult, right?
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.420]   I mean, I'll say, so Dr. Aaron T. Beck,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.780]   who is another clinical psychologist,
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.740]   and he was considered to be the father
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.200]   of our modern day style of therapy,
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.220]   which is cognitive behavior therapy, so CBT.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.880]   He was known to say virtually all of human disturbance
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.860]   is the result of blaming others,
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.220]   blaming society or blaming self
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.620]   for things that have happened.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.620]   And for such blaming, the need for forgiveness arises.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.500]   So what he's saying is virtually all of the things
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.740]   that we struggle with in therapy
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.580]   is that we need to forgive someone
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.540]   and we can't do it on our own.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.660]   That's why there's so many therapists.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.260]   That's why there's so many counselors in this world.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.980]   And what the predominant thing that people need to do
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.880]   when they see a counselor is to forgive.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.760]   And you know, honestly, I am really amazed and impressed
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.980]   and hopeful for the younger generations,
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.860]   for the Gen Zs and the Gen Alphas,
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.240]   because they're trailblazing to normalize therapy.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.740]   Right, do you know how hard it is to get a boomer
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.920]   or my Gen Zs, Gen Xs,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.080]   do you know how hard it is to get us to therapy?
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.880]   We need to be falling apart before we're gonna admit
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.440]   that I need help and I'm gonna talk to someone about it.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.160]   But the younger people,
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.440]   some of the younger people that I lead,
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.200]   no, I'm going to therapy, it's Friday.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.260]   I'm like, okay.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.880]   You know, I'm like, great.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.860]   You know, not only are you doing it,
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.560]   but let's just talk about it.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.340]   Like, the older generations, you'll never know.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.640]   And that's why I think there's hope.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.840]   Things are gonna change.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.800]   But if this is a kind of physical, academic reason,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.240]   what about a spiritual, scriptural reason?
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.760]   Now, I know my mandate isn't to do a biblical thing,
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.320]   but I'm gonna do it anyway, 'cause I am.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.760]   So, number one, right?
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.960]   This is a biblical, scriptural, theological construct
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.840]   for why we should forgive.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.840]   One, 1 John 4, 7-8, we were dead in our transgressions.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.200]   Right, we are separate from God.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.780]   Our destiny was determined to be separate from God
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.240]   because of the sin in our life.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.880]   That is truth as we understand it as believers, right?
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.320]   So, our destiny is broken,
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.660]   and we're gonna be separate from God.
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.300]   However, we know that Jesus has come.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.840]   In Romans 3-23, it says that all have fallen short,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.800]   but Jesus redeems us through the cross, right?
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.280]   So, our eternity now has changed.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.400]   We have been justified to be
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.280]   in eternal relationship with Jesus,
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.880]   but that's in eternity.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.960]   What about today?
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.160]   Well, right now, you and I have the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.420]   We are currently and consistently,
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.480]   in every single moment, sanctified by the presence
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.560]   of the Holy Spirit, according to 1 John 1-9.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.520]   So, not only is our eternity set,
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.920]   but our current presence now is sanctified
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.520]   and cleansed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.640]   But not only that, our status has changed,
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.320]   because now, Romans 8-17, we are co-heirs with Christ.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.800]   What an amazing thing, that our eternity is now changed,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.720]   and our presence is now forgiven,
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.200]   and we are now status changed,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.680]   because we're co-heirs with Christ.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:30.340]   Now, what do we do with this new life and new status?
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.880]   Ephesians 4-32 says, "Love."
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.900]   Love one another,
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.520]   because love, 'cause you have been loved.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.040]   And the exclamation point is in Colossians 3-13,
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.660]   "Forgive, because you have been forgiven."
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.580]   (claps)
[00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.500]   So, not only do we forgive as believers,
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.180]   because we have been forgiven,
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.540]   because Jesus, our Lord and Savior,
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.820]   has exemplified a life of forgiveness,
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.480]   and we have been commanded to do so.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.320]   So, if you want a scriptural foundation for this,
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.020]   this is it.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.960]   We have been redeemed.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.520]   What do we do with that redemption?
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:26.020]   This is a theological construct for forgiveness
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.500]   based on the life and work of Jesus,
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.000]   but what about outside of Jesus?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.140]   What about the whole Bible?
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.180]   Well, the Old Testament is full of examples
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.260]   of God forgiving his people.
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.500]   They constantly turn their backs on them.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.780]   The Israelites say, "We don't even remember who you are,"
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.640]   and God delivers them and forgives them, repeatedly.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.260]   The New Testament, after Jesus was resurrected,
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.020]   and he ascended to heaven,
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.340]   the early church is full of stories of forgiveness,
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.800]   but I'm gonna bring out one, and that's Stephen.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.180]   After Jesus ascended to heaven,
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.900]   the early church started to erupt,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:07.780]   and people were saying, "Jesus is the Messiah,"
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.800]   and Stephen was calling out the Pharisees,
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.840]   the religious order, saying,
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.860]   "And you were the ones that killed him."
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.180]   Now, to say that someone was Messiah in those days,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.320]   it is punishable by death because it is blasphemy,
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.740]   so the religious leaders had every right
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.260]   to take Stephen out and to stone him to death,
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.360]   and that is exactly what they did.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:36.940]   Acts 7, 59, as they started to stone Stephen,
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.020]   Stephen says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:45.220]   He falls to his knees, and as he was being stoned,
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.220]   he said, "Jesus, do not hold their sin against them."
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:58.620]   You want examples of forgiveness?
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.900]   This man was being stoned to death,
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.400]   and his last words were, "Forgive them."
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:08.760]   This is the rich history we have as believers.
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.340]   We forgive because there are physical and mental benefits.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.420]   We forgive because we have the example of Jesus,
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.240]   our Lord and Savior.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.900]   We forgive because we've commanded to,
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.540]   but we also forgive because we have this amazing history
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.860]   from creation all the way till today,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.320]   and it will continue forevermore until Jesus comes back.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.180]   Forgiveness earmarks us as believers.
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.140]   And you know, honestly, I forget
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.080]   that this is our foundation sometimes.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.860]   Now, since I've been coaching since 2011,
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.540]   and since 2019, I've been coaching primarily
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.980]   in a non-Christian space,
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.300]   and honestly, it's just been amazing sometimes.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.460]   There was a situation where I was coaching
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.420]   the number three person in an organization,
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.060]   and it just so happened this person
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.820]   had developed a very negative relationship with their CEO.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.720]   It was so bad that this person would just be triggered
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.580]   seeing that person, and they couldn't communicate,
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.220]   and she was losing sleep, and she was just having anxiety,
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.480]   and so it ended up, she decided,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.040]   "I'm gonna resign from this position," which is fair,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.560]   but her contract stipulated
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   that she had many months left to serve out.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.820]   So as I coached her, I was saying,
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.620]   "You know, how do you want these last few months to go?"
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.200]   I don't know, maybe I'll just avoid him.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.480]   And I said, "Well, I don't know if that's really possible.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.840]   "Four months is a long time, and you gotta hand over."
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.980]   And I just explored.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.840]   I said, "Is it okay if I have a suggestion?"
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.680]   I said, "Would you like to kind of
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.820]   "take a look at this relationship?
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.480]   "There's a lot of time for us to just address it."
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.960]   I used that phrase, "Let's just address it."
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.180]   I didn't say, "Why don't you forgive him?"
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.300]   I didn't say, "Hey, let's forgive this.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.820]   "Let's reconcile."
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.840]   I didn't say any of that.
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.040]   And I'll never forget this, and forgive my language.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.420]   She looked at me and she said, "What?
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.760]   "No, I'm gonna make his life a living hell."
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.960]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.520]   I didn't say that, 'cause if I'm doing that
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.580]   in a professional context, that would not be appropriate
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.320]   for me to say, "What, what's wrong with you?"
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.560]   But I realized, this is a clash of values.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.040]   Because for me, when I heard that this person
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.200]   was experiencing anxiety, that there was a breakdown
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.480]   in the relationship, that she just struggled
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.920]   to even see that person, I'm like, "Why don't you forgive?"
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.800]   And I say that because I've been forgiven by Jesus.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   Why not?
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.320]   This is on the tip of my tongue.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.720]   It's right there because I'm a believer.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.880]   She does not have that context.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   So for her, it was extremely natural
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.240]   for her to access revenge.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.360]   Right?
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.520]   This person hurt me, wronged me,
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.200]   therefore, I'm gonna, I have, remember the definition?
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.660]   I have the right to access resentment.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:22.440]   And I was like, "Wow, we have completely
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.840]   "different foundations."
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:29.760]   If you call yourself, if you identify as a believer
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.640]   in Christ, we have this foundation of forgiveness
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.720]   that should always be somewhere in our consciousness.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.840]   And experiencing the life of people who don't know Jesus,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.360]   I realized, wow, sometimes they do not.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.800]   Now, if this is why we should forgive
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.280]   and what happens when we forgive,
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.120]   how do we actually do this?
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.560]   What does it even look like?
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.960]   Now, remember the definition is that there's both
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.200]   an internal addressing of the situation,
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.360]   but there's also an external change as well.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.440]   So taking the definitions that I shared earlier,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.240]   here are some steps for forgiveness.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.920]   And if any of you are therapists or have been to therapy,
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.000]   you'll recognize these steps.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.080]   First is you need to choose to act.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.120]   Going to therapy and dealing with forgiveness,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.640]   you need to do something.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.640]   I cannot reach into your heart and make you forgive someone.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.820]   You have to do that, right?
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.240]   You cannot sit there and say, "Well, make me."
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.120]   It doesn't work like that, right?
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.920]   So forgiveness needs to first and foremost
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.060]   be a decision that you make.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:49.680]   Then, whatever it looks like,
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.600]   whether you're talking to someone
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.200]   or you're actually going to therapy itself,
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.080]   be willing to abandon your rights to that as resentment.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.640]   What that means is you have to choose to address the issues.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.520]   I have literally been in coaching
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.600]   and in pastoral counseling situations
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.760]   where the person in front of me was forced to be there.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.500]   Either it was a child, like their parents made them,
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.480]   or their spouse or significant other made them.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.840]   And they're sitting there and they refuse to talk about
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.320]   what they really need to talk about.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.200]   It is the most frustrating thing I'm doing
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.840]   when somebody is forced and they don't talk
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.800]   and I'm like, "Buddy, it's been 50 minutes.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.080]   "What are we talking about?"
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.680]   That is not how I coach, by the way.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.320]   That's just my internal mind.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.300]   I feel like I'm confessing a lot here.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.120]   But if you're going to act on forgiveness,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.100]   you need to be willing to go there.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.960]   And that's hard, I understand that.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.080]   But you need to be willing to address that resentment
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.880]   and start that process of abandoning your rights
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.780]   to that resentment.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.620]   And you know what?
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.080]   If you've ever been to therapy,
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.380]   you know it is not a one-time thing.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.260]   It is a constant, repeated thing.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.100]   Why?
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.040]   Because you go one week, you peel back a layer,
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.500]   ho, there's another one, oh, there's two more.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.160]   And you just keep going and then you're like,
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.920]   "What are we talking about?"
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.960]   Jeepers, we're covering everything because it goes deep.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.860]   So it's a repeated process.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.280]   But it isn't just not feeling anger or resentment.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.160]   It's, remember, it's fostering something else.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.200]   It's transforming into something else.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.040]   And I love this phrase by Enright and Fitzgibbons
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   that it is fostering the undeserved qualities of compassion.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.000]   People who have hurt you,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.320]   they may never deserve your grace and forgiveness.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.160]   Full stop.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.020]   But forgiveness is a choice that you make
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.420]   in light of that situation.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:58.460]   So you foster the undeserved qualities of compassion,
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.240]   generosity, and according to Enright and Fitzgibbon,
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.720]   maybe even love.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   And again, it's not a one-time thing.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.680]   It's rinse and repeat.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.280]   Keep doing it.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.040]   Until, remember, this is the outcome,
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.920]   that you are no longer dominated by resentment.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.720]   Now, as I say this repeatedly,
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.880]   I know some of you right now are looking at me
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.380]   and you are honestly dominated by resentment.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.640]   And as I am speaking, I am inviting the Holy Spirit
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.720]   to just knock on your heart.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.100]   And the question is, maybe it's time.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:40.280]   So this is the clinical process of forgiveness.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.600]   This is what happens when you go see a therapist.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.800]   Of course, it's different ways,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.960]   but this is how I was brought through forgiveness.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.760]   But let me give you a scriptural one.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.060]   Let me give you a scriptural how to forgive.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.240]   And I was introduced to this translation.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:55.900]   It's called the Passion Translation.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.160]   It's a paraphrase, kind of like how the message was.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.880]   So it's called the TPT.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.340]   So in the TPT, let me read you Proverbs 20, verse 22.
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.760]   Don't ever say, "I'm going to get even with them
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.400]   "if it's the last thing I do."
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.520]   That's revenge.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.340]   Don't do that.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.840]   Wrap God's grace around your heart,
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.900]   and he will be the one to vindicate you.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:24.040]   Wrap God's grace around your heart.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.900]   Your heart may be broken, battered.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.060]   You may have been abused.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.220]   You may have, you may even struggle
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.620]   to get up in the mornings
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:39.260]   because of the pain that you have suffered.
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:40.840]   How do you forgive?
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.100]   You allow the grace of God to surround your heart,
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.900]   and then you let God vindicate you.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:56.500]   This is not something you can do easily.
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.220]   But thankfully, as we learned from last week's
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.820]   Talk by Promise, we don't do this in our own strength.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.220]   We do this by the grace and the power
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.220]   and the love and the mercy of the presence
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.900]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.220]   Let him wrap his grace around your heart,
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.500]   and then let him vindicate you.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:25.380]   So if it's so powerful,
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.660]   if that's what we do scripturally,
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.940]   if that's what we do physically,
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.860]   what are we supposed to do with this?
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.980]   What now?
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.820]   Am I supposed to forgive in every situation?
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.860]   Am I supposed to just say, "Oh, I forgive you.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.820]   "You can do whatever you want to me
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.900]   "because I'm gonna forgive you."
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:46.500]   Let me say this, and I cannot say this any stronger.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.140]   If you are currently in a situation of abuse,
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.900]   physical, sexual, emotional, psychological abuse,
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.260]   get out.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.700]   Talk to somebody.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:00.460]   To live a life of forgiveness
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.380]   doesn't mean you have to accept abuse.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.720]   Get safe, get out, talk to someone.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.420]   If you don't trust a family member,
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.500]   go and talk to a friend.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   If you don't trust friends,
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.420]   go and talk to some of the pastoral team.
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.940]   If you don't trust them, go and talk to a counselor,
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.580]   but do not accept the abuse that's happening.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.980]   I'm personally a mandatory reporter.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.100]   If I see or hear about anything
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.780]   in the realm of physical or sexual abuse,
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.500]   I am mandated to report it directly to the police.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.780]   Now, I don't know about that in Hong,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.300]   I don't know what the laws are in Hong Kong,
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.420]   but that's what I practice,
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.820]   and I know there's nuance here,
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.380]   but do not accept abuse
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.700]   just because you think that's the Christian way.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.700]   Get help, get out, and get safe.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.560]   In fact, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.700]   the QR code for Oasis Counseling Center.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.780]   This is the counseling center
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   that's attached to the Vine Church.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.900]   Now, if those of you who need it,
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.740]   I wanna ask you to do it,
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.260]   but to protect the identity of those
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.420]   who genuinely need to reach out,
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.700]   I'm gonna ask all of you to take out your phones
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.820]   and just at least do the act of it
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.620]   so that someone who really needs it
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.860]   is not feeling like, oh, everybody's looking at me.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.080]   Obviously, I need help,
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.380]   so let's all do it.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.600]   Now, some of you who are laughing and doing this,
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.980]   you need to go!
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.300]   So let's just protect those who really need it,
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.220]   but if any of you need to get out
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.540]   and you don't know what to do,
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.260]   please contact our counseling team.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.340]   They would love to,
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.900]   all of our trained professional counselors
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.200]   would love to talk to you.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.700]   But let's say you're clear of the abuse.
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.260]   Maybe it happened a while ago,
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.860]   weeks, months, years, maybe even decades,
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:37.740]   but that phrase, dominated by resentment, still stands.
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:41.480]   Maybe when you think of what happened to you
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.940]   or what was done to you,
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:47.640]   you still have rage or anger or pain
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.700]   or you want vengeance or,
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.600]   it's just uncontrollable, a negative response.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.360]   And I bet you some of you are looking at me
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.200]   and intently you're saying,
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.320]   "You don't know how hard it was.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.860]   "You don't know how painful it was.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.400]   "You don't know what I've been through, Derek."
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.120]   And you're right, I'll never know,
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.320]   but Jesus does.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:16.780]   Jesus knows every single thing that has happened.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:23.240]   And you can say to me, "Oh, well, why wasn't he there?
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.040]   "Why did he allow this to happen?"
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.120]   I will never be able to explain that to you
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.480]   and I'm not even gonna try.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.280]   But I wanna tell you that Jesus understands your pain.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.960]   The perfect, sinless Son of God came to earth
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.100]   to experience life on earth to its fullness.
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.120]   And near the end of his life,
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   he was accused of being a blasphemer,
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.080]   tortured, stripped down, humiliated,
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.020]   forced to wear a crown of thorns,
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.280]   paraded through the city
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.780]   for nothing of his wrongdoing of his own,
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:11.120]   but because he went to take yours and my sin.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.320]   You think Jesus doesn't understand betrayal?
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.860]   You think Jesus doesn't understand pain and suffering?
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.820]   He absolutely understands it.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:29.080]   Luke 23, "And when they came to the place
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.800]   "that's called Skull, there they crucified him,"
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.000]   being Jesus, "with the criminals."
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.560]   They treated him, our Savior, as a criminal
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.680]   because of my sin.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.840]   And they hung him there,
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:49.000]   bleeding, alone.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   And what does he say?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.160]   He said, "Father, forgive them,
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.800]   "for they know not what they do."
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.840]   (chuckles)
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.840]   Our Savior, in the midst of being betrayed
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.560]   by the very people he came to save,
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.160]   he says, "Forgive them."
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:15.580]   This is our God.
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:22.680]   See, forgiveness is the central core aspect of our faith.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.360]   There's no justification.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.400]   There's no sanctification.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.720]   There's no nothing without forgiveness.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.240]   We don't have a faith.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.540]   We don't have a Savior without forgiveness.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.040]   And so the only way we can experience the true fullness
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.640]   of what God has for us is that we receive that forgiveness
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.040]   and then we extend it to others.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   Because if we don't, who are we to say,
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.080]   we receive all that forgiveness, and then we say,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.480]   "No, I'm not gonna forgive others."
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:56.200]   Then we become a block to the love
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.760]   and the power of forgiveness in this world
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.960]   because we hoard it for ourselves.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.720]   Or we don't think Jesus has the power to forgive,
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.560]   which both is not true.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.740]   Is forgiveness easy?
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.520]   No, it's absolutely not.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.480]   But thankfully, we have the person of Jesus
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.240]   in the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.040]   I'm not gonna tell you what to do.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.180]   I'm going to ask the Holy Spirit to do that.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.140]   I'm gonna share one last story.
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.040]   Can I get the pen?
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:35.960]   I grew up in a Chinese family.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.460]   My parents are from Hong Kong.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.280]   And my dad immigrated to the States,
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.780]   had a great upbringing there.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.940]   And then we came back to Hong Kong
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.780]   and I lived the expat life.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.820]   I went to island school,
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:48.220]   if there's anyone who went to island school.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.940]   I went to, you know, I was able to have all the things,
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.540]   you know, tennis club, golf club, woo-hoo.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.500]   I lived the life, right?
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.840]   I even went to university in the States.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.820]   So my father being a very Chinese man,
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.820]   loved us in the way that Chinese men do.
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.700]   He provided for us, right?
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.340]   Did I have a relationship with my father?
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.380]   No.
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.620]   Did I sit down and talk to my dad
[00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.760]   about all my hopes and dreams?
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.600]   No.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.080]   Did I sit there and just ask him how his day was?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.040]   No, that's not the relationship that I have with my father.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.080]   In the late stages of his life,
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.160]   he had severe dementia
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.080]   and a number of other ailments with his body,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.740]   but then he developed a cancer in his jawbone.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:36.120]   And because his overall health was so poor,
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.760]   the doctors said, "We cannot operate on him.
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.560]   "He won't survive the operation."
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.840]   So essentially they said, "There's nothing we can do."
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.720]   So we just tried in the later stages of his life
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.360]   to have his quality of life as positive as it could be.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.040]   But the cancer grew to a point
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.760]   where it fused his mouth shut.
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.780]   So he could no longer chew.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.120]   And if there was one thing that my father loved doing,
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.960]   it was eating.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.320]   He was diabetic, but he loved his ice creams
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.160]   and he loved fatty char siu.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.680]   It was just ridiculous.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.880]   But once he could no longer take solid food,
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.860]   he just disintegrated.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.320]   And so we're very thankful that he didn't suffer very long,
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.420]   but ultimately he succumbed to the cancer.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.760]   A few hours after he passed,
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.440]   I was outside in the hospital,
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.080]   outside the operating room,
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.680]   and I was able to go and say my farewell to my father,
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.880]   just a few hours passed.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.720]   I stood there
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.060]   and I said, "Dad, thank you so much for the life
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.400]   "that you provided for me."
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.640]   Then I found myself saying,
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.500]   "You know, Dad, I forgive you for not being the father
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.460]   "I wish you were."
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.380]   And I would love to tell you
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:51.760]   that I had this wave of emotion, of tears of joy,
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.800]   and this just release, but I didn't.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.840]   You know what I felt?
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.020]   Shame.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.680]   I don't have very many regrets in my life,
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.520]   but I felt in that moment, shame.
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:09.200]   Because why didn't I care enough
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.800]   to say this to my father when he was of sound mind
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.920]   and of sound health,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.560]   so that we could actually build the relationship
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.560]   that I wish we had?
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.280]   So what I'm saying is when it comes to forgiveness,
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.560]   don't be like me.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:27.800]   Don't wait.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:33.300]   'Cause then you don't know if you have the chance.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.340]   Why don't we all stand here today?
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:49.520]   Maybe if you could just close your eyes.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.360]   (gentle music)
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.160]   Heavenly Father, I thank you for every single person
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.800]   here in this room and everyone online who's watching.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.040]   I don't know their story.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.240]   I don't know their pain.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.420]   I don't know where they're at, but you do.
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:11.400]   So Father, I ask right now by the power and mercy
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.820]   and grace of your Holy Spirit,
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.780]   come and minister to your people now.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.560]   It is not in our strength that we can do this,
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.960]   but wrap your grace around our hearts
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.540]   and help us to be conjurants of forgiveness.
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:35.240]   No matter how painful or difficult it is,
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.840]   Jesus, you promise that you are with us.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.520]   So guide us now, minister to us,
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.080]   and we thank you in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.660]   (gentle music)
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.240]   (gentle music)
