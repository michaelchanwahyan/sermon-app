1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 Have you ever found yourself in one of those moments in life where everything feels like

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,360
 it's out of control?

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,760
 Where there's literally nothing you can do to advance, to work through your situation.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,360
 One of those moments where there's no amount of resources or money or networking or friendships

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:31,840
 or like there's just nothing you can actually do to get out of a situation, to reach a goal,

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,840
 to change a bad medical report.

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,360
 One of those moments where if God doesn't show up, and I don't mean like you get a little

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:51,440
 bit of luck, like I mean if you don't experience something that's undisputably a miracle, you're

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,920
 not going to be able to make it through.

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,080
 You're not going to be able to accomplish or reach that goal.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,120
 Has anyone been in that space before?

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,960
 For me, I found myself in that very same spot in 2013.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,520
 So 2013, I was graduating from university.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,120
 I was super young, younger than I am now.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,080
 And yeah, I was graduating from university and I knew that God had called me to move

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,200
 to this side of the world.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
 I was pretty convinced God wanted me to come to Hong Kong, but there were these massive,

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,080
 massive barriers in my way.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
 There were three things.

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
 So let's break them down.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,880
 The first thing, probably the biggest thing was this.

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,120
 I was not a citizen of any country.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
 That's kind of hard.

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
 I had no passport.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,560
 See, my family moved from Liberia.

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,360
 No, my family fled Liberia as refugees in 1994 during the Liberian Civil War.

27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,000
 So I came to the US under what's called a United Nations travel document, which meant

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,160
 I couldn't just leave and go to another country.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,120
 And so if I wanted to come to Hong Kong without a passport, without belonging to anyone, that

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,360
 would have been extremely difficult.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,160
 Now, my family had experienced going through this process of trying to get my citizenship

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,560
 so that I could have a passport.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,440
 We tried years and years and spent thousands of thousands of dollars and to no avail.

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,020
 Every time something was wrong or I needed to send another document, there was always

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,020
 something extra.

36
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,520
 And we tried for up to seven years and could not break through this.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,240
 And now I was needing it in three months.

38
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,560
 It felt like a proper uphill battle.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,300
 The second thing was this.

40
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,920
 As I was in university, I was a broke college student.

41
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,760
 I had no money.

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,880
 Literally I had no money.

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,760
 So in order for me to come to Hong Kong, I don't know if you guys are aware of this,

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,960
 but Hong Kong is, and they hold the number one ranking in this, the most expensive city

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,720
 to live in for someone who's an expat.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,880
 So you can't just show up to Hong Kong and I'll make it.

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
 Doesn't really work that way.

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,640
 You kind of have to have some money to be able to get around in the city.

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
 And I had none.

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,680
 I had zero, well, not zero.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,520
 I had a total of, big number here, 11,000 Hong Kong dollars.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,280
 It's not gonna get you very far if it even covers rent, right?

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,120
 We know how expensive it is here.

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320
 So that was the second big obstacle.

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,760
 The third obstacle was around my degree.

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,080
 Now I was studying psychology.

57
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,240
 Yes, I studied psychology.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,800
 I can help you with your problems.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
 But I was in this course.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,160
 In order to graduate, I needed to pass neuroscience.

61
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,080
 Who even knows what neuroscience is?

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,600
 Don't raise your hand.

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
 Don't do it.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,080
 I studied it then and I still can't tell you what it is, but this course was extremely

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 difficult.

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,080
 I was coming through Greek 1 and Greek 2, Hebrew 1 and Hebrew 2, and I would much rather

67
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,120
 take those again than neuroscience.

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,200
 Yeah, so I struggled in this course.

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,320
 I remember taking a test and actually being present and going through and filling out

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,760
 the answers and getting my score and getting a zero.

71
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,960
 I needed, so you're saying, three massive obstacles, citizenship, finances, and needing

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,760
 to graduate in order to come here.

73
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,040
 I knew God wanted me here.

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,280
 I think we've all been in that space before.

75
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,920
 We knew God is doing something.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,300
 We know He has a plan.

77
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,720
 We know He's building something.

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,080
 But unless the Lord Himself does something, intervenes in our space, we're not going to

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,600
 be able to get there.

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,760
 Like think about how we are now.

81
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,080
 Like what do we do when we face that?

82
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,440
 When we're in those moments where your best effort just isn't good enough.

83
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,840
 How do you respond?

84
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,120
 Like that.

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,680
 When life seems to not be responding to you, think about what Hong Kong feels like now.

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,760
 We've been through massive political changes.

87
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,560
 The political landscape of our city is vastly different.

88
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,480
 We have friends and families who are leaving the city.

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,640
 There's nothing we can really do about that.

90
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
 Think wider.

91
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
 It's going to the third year of COVID.

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
 It was COVID-19.

93
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
 Now it's COVID-20.

94
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
 It's COVID-21.

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,120
 It just keeps going.

96
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,600
 And there's nothing we can really do to change that.

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,680
 Our best effort doesn't stop these things.

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,920
 They're bigger than us.

99
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:28,320
 And we sit in this space of anxiety and tension and frustration where we start to lose hope

100
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,920
 in the promises of God.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:38,520
 We start to forget who he is because we are engulfed in our fears and our anxieties.

102
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,000
 It makes us feel restless and tired.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 It makes some of us tired of being tired.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,800
 These tensions that we face now are nothing new to what the biblical audience would have

105
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 experienced.

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,080
 When we look at scripture, we see that the people of Israel, they had some pretty rough

107
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 experiences.

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,240
 These are the same people who were once exiled out of their country.

109
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,280
 So people came in, the Assyrians and the Babylonians came into their country, burned down Jerusalem,

110
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,820
 burned down their temple, took them back as slaves.

111
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,040
 They had no country.

112
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
 They were exiled.

113
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,480
 Their identity ripped from them.

114
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,160
 They know a thing or two about tension, about anxiety.

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,360
 These are the same people who had foreign people living in their country, occupying

116
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,720
 their land.

117
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,600
 If we look at the day and age of Jesus, he had the Romans occupying Palestine.

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,800
 They know a thing or two about the tension.

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
 They know a thing or two about anxiety.

120
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,400
 And actually, as we look to scripture, that context is what I want us to think about when

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,600
 we look at Psalms 127.

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:56,160
 See, 127 is written by Solomon, and he's addressing these very tensions in a unique way to bring

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,240
 peace to the followers of God, which sounds odd because there's tension, so how can you

124
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
 have peace?

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,560
 But Solomon was the wisest man in the world, so he was able to get us there.

126
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,040
 Psalm 127 sits in the middle of a bunch of Psalms.

127
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,160
 There's Psalm 120 to Psalm 134.

128
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,520
 These are called the Psalms of Ascent.

129
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,560
 What would happen here is that the Jewish people would keep these songs on their mind

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,280
 as they would travel into Jerusalem.

131
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,920
 Jerusalem was located on a hill, hence why it was a song of ascent, right?

132
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,800
 So they would remember these truths.

133
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
 They would speak these truths.

134
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,360
 They would recite them.

135
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,600
 It would prepare their hearts for something about God in order that they might worship,

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,880
 in order that they might connect with him.

137
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,040
 There was something in these Psalms of Ascent, especially when we look at Psalm 127, that

138
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:52,840
 really reshaped and reframed perspective.

139
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,000
 It's how they would remember who God was.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,400
 God's word here was a reminder for them, for those moments when it does feel like things

141
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,200
 are literally out of control, so those moments where you do lose hope and lose perspective

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,720
 on who you are and potentially even on who God is.

143
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,760
 So I want us to crack our Bibles open today and look at Psalm 127 and see what King Solomon

144
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,800
 writes and how that might change our perspective, how that might remind us of some truth to

145
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,400
 address our anxieties, to bring stability into our attention.

146
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,840
 Psalm 127 reads like this.

147
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,920
 It says, "Unless the Lord builds the house, the builder labors in vain.

148
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,880
 Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.

149
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,440
 And in vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat.

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,480
 For he grants sleep to those he loves."

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 He grants sleep to those he loves.

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,760
 See, this Psalm is speaking about the role of God.

153
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,600
 It's helping us understand a little better what is God's role, what is our role.

154
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,680
 Who is God and what is his role?

155
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,520
 Who are we and what is our role?

156
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,640
 The first thing we can see about this is unless the Lord builds the house.

157
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,160
 See, who is the house builder?

158
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,040
 The Lord is, right?

159
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,480
 And so we look at this and we see that God is the one who is responsible for building

160
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,680
 your house.

161
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,260
 God is responsible for building your house.

162
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,480
 It's up to him.

163
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
 It's not solely up to you.

164
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,640
 It's not solely up to me.

165
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,280
 This is good news.

166
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,960
 This is really good news, actually, because God is the one that's building.

167
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
 He's all powerful.

168
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,380
 What can he not do?

169
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,560
 If it's up to him, it's significantly better than if it was stuck with just you and stuck

170
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,840
 with just me.

171
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,800
 So the house that's being spoken here can refer to two things.

172
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,120
 The first thing being the family household, the actual mom, dad, children, all of that.

173
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,040
 So potentially you're here today and you're in that space.

174
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,280
 You're experiencing a difficulty maybe being a parent.

175
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:17,720
 Maybe you're here today and you're trying to have a family and it's hard.

176
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,240
 Maybe you're here today and you don't know how to respect your mom and dad.

177
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,920
 I want to encourage you that God comes alongside.

178
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,280
 These efforts are what builds us into what we need to be in order to have a successful

179
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
 family.

180
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,960
 It's God who establishes the family.

181
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,840
 It's God who builds the family.

182
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:46,160
 Please don't take that responsibility on only your shoulders.

183
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,520
 The house also represents a second concept.

184
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,760
 When we think about a house, we think of basic needs, you know, a roof over your head as

185
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,100
 a basic need.

186
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:01,040
 So when we see it in that light, we realize it is God's responsibility to provide for

187
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,240
 our basic need.

188
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,620
 Maybe you're here and the financial times has been a hard struggle for you.

189
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,860
 Maybe you haven't found a job yet.

190
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,120
 Maybe you're in between jobs.

191
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,840
 Maybe you're unhappy at your job.

192
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,800
 Maybe you feel like you're just waking up to work.

193
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,200
 I encourage you that God builds our house.

194
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
 God's there.

195
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,320
 He knows.

196
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
 He's with you and He's building alongside you.

197
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,160
 You don't have to burden and carry that on your own.

198
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,680
 Building the house, building the temple.

199
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,920
 See, we actually talked about this earlier in the year.

200
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,320
 Pastor Andrew went through a series.

201
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,280
 I remember the one thing I remember from that sermon is God bless it, God bless it.

202
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
 Was anyone here for that?

203
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 All right.

204
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,480
 So it's about Zerubbabel back in Zachariah chapter four.

205
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,720
 And Zerubbabel has laid the foundation for the temple.

206
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,760
 And God speaks to him and He's talking to these people who are going to be laboring,

207
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,080
 physically building things, people who need strength and who need power.

208
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:06,040
 And He says that it's not by might, it won't be by power, which is conscious.

209
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,480
 How do you build something without might and power?

210
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,800
 God says it's by my spirit.

211
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,960
 We must be partnering with God to build anything.

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,640
 It must have something of God in it for it to be built.

213
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,740
 This verse is telling us that apart from God, we actually can't build or accomplish anything

214
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,400
 that matters, that's lasting.

215
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,640
 God is the chief builder.

216
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,400
 He's the actual one building.

217
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,920
 He's the only one that can properly establish.

218
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,000
 He brings into existence what is not.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,640
 Further it says that He is leading the charge and He's building the whole thing.

220
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,360
 And if He is not doing that, then our efforts are in vain.

221
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,560
 Maybe vain's a fancy word.

222
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
 I'll break it down.

223
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,960
 It's a waste of our time when we put our efforts into the things that God isn't building.

224
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,560
 Like you waste your actual time.

225
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
 And why is that?

226
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,800
 Because unless the Lord is actually building it, the things that we might be building end

227
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,040
 up being void of meaning.

228
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,160
 And who wants to work?

229
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,360
 Who wants to sweat?

230
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,560
 Who wants to pour resources and years and tons of energy into something that will not

231
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:35,720
 last, something that does not ultimately matter?

232
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,120
 Notice that God is calling us into this.

233
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,800
 I think it's a little tricky sometimes.

234
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,840
 We hear this, that God is building and we have to leave it up to God in order for it

235
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 to be accomplished.

236
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,720
 And some of us might think that that means we get to sit on our hands.

237
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,680
 It's not what it means.

238
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,480
 No, we don't get to just give it all to God and say, "Okay, you figure it out.

239
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
 I'm going to go take a nap."

240
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,160
 That's not what it's saying.

241
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,360
 No, see, there's the builder and then there's the laborers.

242
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,280
 There's God's role and then there's your role.

243
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,680
 We are called to, as the New Testament would say, co-labor with Christ.

244
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,680
 We are called to be a part of what He's doing.

245
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,960
 He has invited us in.

246
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,880
 It's an invitation to join with what God is doing in the world.

247
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,300
 No, we have a role.

248
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,600
 This verse is not an excuse to put down the things that God has put in your hands, but

249
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,120
 instead it's to put down the desire to control your life.

250
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,880
 We build alongside Him.

251
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,760
 We build alongside Him.

252
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,960
 See, this is ultimately because you and I, we have a limited perspective.

253
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,800
 What we see, where we are, what we can fathom is limited.

254
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,720
 But God isn't in that same space.

255
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,560
 See, God is above these things.

256
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,280
 He's the alpha and the omega.

257
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,600
 He's the beginning and the end.

258
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,280
 He knows how the story goes.

259
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 He knows how it ends.

260
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,060
 He wrote it.

261
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:17,040
 And so when we build what He has designed, it has meaning.

262
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,120
 Unfortunately, we can find ourselves attaching ourselves to things that have no meaning,

263
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,400
 building and sweating and toiling behind things that have no meaning.

264
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,760
 And the only way for our lives to be fruitful, for the things that we are building to last

265
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,720
 and to matter is if it's partnered with what God is doing.

266
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,480
 See, God has done this funny thing.

267
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,320
 He's put us in a position of not ultimately being in control of our own lives.

268
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
 I think about that.

269
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,560
 You actually don't have ultimate control of your own life.

270
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:57,080
 He's caused you to have to be dependent on Him on purpose.

271
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,960
 That's by design.

272
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
 And that's probably a scary reality.

273
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,360
 I mean, think about how our world operates today.

274
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,640
 It's so overemphasizes what we can do.

275
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,320
 If we just get the right job, if we just marry the right person, if we just go to the right

276
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:20,040
 school, get the right grades, have the right internship, grease the right elbows, that's

277
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,560
 actually not what the Scripture is saying though.

278
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,760
 See, the Scripture is countercultural.

279
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:31,460
 And the things that our culture and our present age promotes and are overexerting ourselves

280
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,760
 is tiring.

281
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,440
 It does lead us to anxiety.

282
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,040
 What happens when we do all that and we still don't get there?

283
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,200
 We live in this space, in this cloud of anxiety.

284
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,800
 Remember, Jesus tells us that following Him is different than living in the world.

285
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,960
 He says His burden is light.

286
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,880
 Did that sound light to you?

287
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,760
 His yoke is He and His burden is light.

288
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,360
 He's not called us to carry all these things.

289
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,360
 See, if we don't let God build, if we don't allow Him to be the chief architect of our

290
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:12,680
 lives, we end up building a fallen version of God's plans, something that will break,

291
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,120
 something that will wither, something that's imperfect.

292
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,120
 See, the version that God wants to build is meant to be unshakable.

293
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,720
 The version that God wants to build is meant to last.

294
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,360
 And that can only happen if we let God in the driver's seat, if we allow Him to assume

295
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,320
 control, if we build alongside Him and we learn to be dependent.

296
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,360
 And there's actually a peace in this.

297
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,880
 Like, there is genuine peace in knowing that.

298
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,520
 This peace comes from knowing that it's not just up to us.

299
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,360
 It's not just up to you and me.

300
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,360
 God is actually the one who's responsible for His people.

301
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,400
 So yes, God is building and He's responsible for the building project.

302
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,280
 He's responsible for your future and for building up these things.

303
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,680
 But ultimately, He's responsible for those things because He's responsible for you.

304
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,280
 He's responsible for you.

305
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
 Like, you are His.

306
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
 We belong to Him.

307
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,320
 We're not left to fend for ourselves.

308
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,120
 We've been grafted into His family.

309
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,320
 So whether it's your five-year plan, whether it's your family, whether it's your future,

310
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,560
 whether it's getting into a certain school, know that it all belongs to Him because you

311
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,720
 belong to Him.

312
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,680
 So we can breathe, people of God.

313
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,080
 We can take a breath.

314
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,440
 He's got it.

315
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,840
 He's got the house.

316
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,760
 He's got our future because He's got us.

317
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,280
 See, for me, I got to witness this firsthand.

318
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,760
 Coming to Hong Kong was the uphill journey like I explained, right?

319
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,840
 The three things, the passport, the money, and the grades.

320
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,120
 So what happened to me was, again, miraculous.

321
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:09,120
 We'd been trying for seven-plus years to get my naturalization to the US.

322
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,480
 And within three months, we get a call from immigration saying that my papers had been

323
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,800
 approved, which was massive.

324
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,520
 I mean, we kept trying.

325
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,720
 Someone would misspell a name or would say something about this or would write this and

326
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,280
 there'd be something wrong that would restart the whole process, not just like back a step,

327
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,920
 the whole thing.

328
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,040
 The papers were approved.

329
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,440
 They set a date.

330
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
 This date normally is set for anywhere within the next two years.

331
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,040
 It was set for that month.

332
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,360
 I mean, I'm not that smart, but I passed the test.

333
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,960
 It was great.

334
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
 But you see what I'm saying?

335
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,280
 Like, this is something I couldn't do on my own.

336
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
 I genuinely had no control.

337
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,240
 I had to let go.

338
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,840
 I had to let God do it.

339
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,920
 I didn't know anyone.

340
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,640
 I couldn't navigate that space, but God came through for me.

341
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,440
 God broke through the impossible for me.

342
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,640
 Do we see what he does when we allow the chief architect?

343
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
 He was building this.

344
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
 This was his goal.

345
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,440
 Do you see what happens when we allow him to step in?

346
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,320
 Let's talk about finances.

347
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,200
 Remember I was a broke college kid.

348
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,040
 So coming to Hong Kong was going to be difficult.

349
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,020
 My friends, Irem and Rick, and I prayed.

350
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,720
 We said, "God," and you know, when you're young and in your 20s, you can pray crazy

351
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
 prayers.

352
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,480
 We're like, "God, give us a free flat."

353
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,240
 Looking back on it, I realized how much faith we had.

354
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,600
 You're not going to get a free flat in Hong Kong.

355
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,800
 You're not going to get free anything in Hong Kong.

356
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
 We prayed and we believed.

357
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,720
 We said, "God, you want us to get there?

358
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,440
 We don't have...we need this.

359
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,640
 We genuinely need it."

360
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,680
 And you know, God didn't give us a free flat.

361
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,880
 Instead, he gave us a flat where we paid one US dollar for a whole year.

362
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,640
 I think that does the trick, right?

363
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,840
 Was that good on his end?

364
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,360
 God provided, guys.

365
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,200
 Like, again, this was...I didn't know anyone here.

366
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,520
 I'd actually never been to Hong Kong before I packed my bags and moved all the way over

367
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
 here.

368
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
 So I didn't know people.

369
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,760
 I didn't have networks and communities and I knew no one.

370
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,800
 Unless God went before me and did the things God did, this wouldn't be possible.

371
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
 God built the house.

372
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,480
 He got me here.

373
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,360
 And I believe God wants to do the same thing for us.

374
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,880
 He wants to get rid of the void of us having to stress and toil and strive and live in

375
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,120
 deep anxiety, questioning who we are and questioning our maker.

376
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
 The verse continues.

377
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,320
 Solomon then reveals a second characteristic of God that's pretty important as well.

378
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 Speaking to our attention.

379
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,200
 See, he says, "Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchmen watch in vain."

380
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,760
 So now he's talked about God's ability to build these things up.

381
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,560
 Now he talks about God's ability to protect.

382
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,360
 And what we see here is that God is the guardian.

383
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,720
 He assumes that role.

384
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,240
 We see that only God can protect what only God can build.

385
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,960
 Now, this can be hard for some of us because we realize God gets us here and we think that,

386
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
 "Okay, God's got us here.

387
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,760
 Now it's up to me to keep God's promise alive."

388
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,640
 There's a freedom that it's not all on your shoulders.

389
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,280
 Consider that the sovereignty of God is what brings protection to us as individuals and

390
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,560
 to our wider communities.

391
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,960
 God will protect what God will build.

392
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
 You don't have to fight alone.

393
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,500
 There is another person fighting on your behalf, fighting with you because he's responsible

394
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,720
 for you and he's got your best interest in mind.

395
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,360
 See, God will build and he will protect what he builds.

396
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,800
 God will build and he will sustain what he builds.

397
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,040
 The second thing we get from this space is that God sees and cares about what happens

398
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,800
 to us and what's happening around us.

399
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,640
 Now, I think it's awesome that the verse doesn't just say, "God gives the plans for building

400
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,480
 and then the builders have to do it."

401
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,640
 Notice it's not what Psalm 127 says.

402
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,480
 It speaks of what God does as a verb, an action.

403
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,320
 It says, "Unless the Lord builds."

404
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,480
 So he's involved in the building process.

405
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:38,480
 He's not sitting far away, removed from us, expecting us to figure it out.

406
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,360
 No, God is there and because he's there, because he's a part of the building, he sees.

407
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,680
 He sees what's happening.

408
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,540
 He knows the context.

409
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,600
 He's aware of the surroundings and the environments.

410
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,240
 Therefore, God knows the things that we need.

411
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,520
 See, God sees and because he sees, he cares.

412
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,460
 He knows what's on our heart.

413
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,000
 He knows how difficult COVID's been.

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,880
 He's not unaware of it.

415
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,260
 He's still building.

416
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,780
 He knows what 2019 looked like for Hong Kong in the aftermath.

417
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,080
 He's not unaware.

418
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,860
 He's not confused up there, detached from our reality.

419
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,000
 He knows and believe this, he's still building.

420
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,040
 He's still building you.

421
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,400
 God knows what's around us.

422
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,440
 He knows the things in our space and he cares for us.

423
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,080
 He cares about the things that we face and it's really great.

424
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,000
 Peter in the New Testament actually says this.

425
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,600
 He says, "Cast your burdens onto him because he cares for you."

426
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,860
 Like, yes, our God is able to build and sustain but he does it out of care, not just out of

427
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,720
 almighty power.

428
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,740
 So could we cast our burdens today?

429
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,440
 See this is where I find my rest when I'm in moments of anxiety, when I'm afraid.

430
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,960
 It's this idea that we can rest when we know he is still fully in control even when we

431
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,820
 are not.

432
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,400
 God's still building.

433
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,140
 Here and now, God's still building.

434
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,100
 God's still sustaining.

435
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,300
 This is where rest comes from.

436
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,540
 This is where stability comes from.

437
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,640
 This is how you can sleep better at night.

438
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,180
 We find peace when we realize that God's gonna build it and God's gonna be the one to protect

439
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,980
 it and he invites us to be a part of it.

440
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,060
 So I get to Hong Kong.

441
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,180
 We are all learning so much about me today.

442
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,740
 I get to Hong Kong and obviously I'm not still living in a flat that's only $1 a year.

443
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
 That bit ran out.

444
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:51,540
 That would have been great if it stayed this long but it didn't.

445
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,660
 So yeah, I'm here and I'm actually working as a volunteer, aka I'm not getting paid.

446
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,740
 I am volunteer working.

447
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,780
 And it's quite hard to live in Hong Kong as a volunteer, right?

448
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,860
 I think we all, not as many people here are just living as volunteers from what I can

449
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
 tell.

450
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
 I needed money.

451
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,860
 I had none and it was really interesting how God put the right people in front of me.

452
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,540
 He literally put people in my life that I would have never thought to ask for money.

453
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,180
 I'm really bad at asking for money by the way.

454
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,260
 I'm glad I didn't have to ask too much or I would have not made it.

455
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,180
 But I had friends or acquaintances, maybe not even friends from university, people that

456
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:35,720
 I didn't really talk to that much that would send me near about three and a half thousand

457
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,900
 a month just because they were praying and they felt like they wanted to support Promise

458
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
 where he was.

459
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,860
 Like a guy who I had gotten into a fight about relationship stuff with who tried to date

460
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,980
 my now wife.

461
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,860
 He sent me money.

462
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,860
 Get that.

463
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:54,460
 Only God can make that kind of stuff happen, right?

464
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,980
 Like there's no smoothing.

465
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
 We're best friends now.

466
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
 He just had a baby.

467
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
 I just had a baby.

468
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
 We're great.

469
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,740
 But the point of the story is God was watching out for me.

470
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,600
 He was the one sustaining me.

471
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,300
 Another man in Hong Kong was sending me 2,000 a month.

472
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,540
 Okay, so we got a little bit here, a little bit there.

473
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,300
 At that time, my wife and I were not married.

474
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
 We were dating.

475
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
 I was in Hong Kong.

476
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,300
 She was in the US.

477
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,340
 And I needed money to be able to propose to her because I wanted to get married.

478
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,580
 And I wasn't making any money.

479
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,540
 And the money that I had, I was eating McDonald's with it.

480
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,860
 So I was not able to save it up and propose to her.

481
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,100
 And I just remember there was this Sunday I led worship at the church that I was serving

482
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
 at.

483
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,180
 And this couple came in.

484
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,440
 It was their first time.

485
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,500
 The guy was this tall, slender, white guy.

486
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,820
 The woman was a Chinese lady.

487
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,820
 They're from Shanghai.

488
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,940
 They've been living there for years.

489
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
 And they're just up in Hong Kong.

490
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,380
 And afterwards, they were like, "Hey, let's take you for a meal."

491
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,380
 And I said, "Yes."

492
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
 Because you know what?

493
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
 It would be free.

494
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,380
 So we go to a meal.

495
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,100
 We go to Tai Heng.

496
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,420
 I get good cha siu and good iced milk tea, living my best life.

497
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,820
 And I'm just telling them about my life.

498
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,460
 You know, again, I'm bad at asking for money.

499
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
 So I'm not asking.

500
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,020
 I'm just telling them what I'm doing in Hong Kong and how long I've been there.

501
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,800
 And I brought up the fact that I had this beautiful girlfriend back in America who I

502
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
 couldn't wait to marry one day.

503
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,520
 I was deeply in love with her.

504
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
 She was going to move to Hong Kong.

505
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
 We were going to have babies.

506
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
 And this whole...

507
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,640
 I had this whole plan mapped out.

508
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,920
 And the very next Sunday, I come back in and I do my thing, get up there, plug the guitar

509
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
 and lead worship.

510
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
 After worship, the sermon comes up.

511
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,680
 After the sermon, we're getting ready to go.

512
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,480
 And they bring me an envelope.

513
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,960
 And it's full of cash.

514
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,020
 Literally $25,000.

515
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,940
 Y'all, that's unreal.

516
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,940
 That's unreal.

517
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
 $25,000.

518
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:46,080
 They said, "We feel like God wants us to bless you."

519
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,500
 The ring that my wife wears now is because of God providing then.

520
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,980
 To make it even crazier, we go to the jewelry store and I only have my 25K, which is like

521
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,440
 a trillion dollars in my mind at the time.

522
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,620
 And I'm like, "I need a ring, but I know nothing about rings."

523
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,900
 And rings are expensive.

524
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
 Diamonds cost a lot of money.

525
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,060
 I learned that.

526
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,460
 And I talked to the guy and he was like, "Oh, I'm a Christian and you work for a church.

527
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,380
 I will give you the ring you want for however much you have."

528
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,720
 Again, this isn't normal.

529
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,980
 This doesn't happen every day.

530
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:35,160
 God continued to provide, continued to sustain.

531
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
 So what do we do with that?

532
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
 You've heard my story.

533
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,000
 You've heard what God's done for me.

534
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,640
 And we hear that God builds and He protects what He builds and aligning ourselves with

535
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
 Him.

536
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,620
 How do we enter into that space?

537
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,640
 Maybe the first thing we can do is in our circumstances, where we are, in the tension,

538
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,440
 in the here and now, the first question I think is good to ask yourself is this, is

539
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,160
 this something God is building or something I'm building on my own?

540
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,760
 I think that's really critical, right?

541
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,480
 Because I could not on my own have accomplished those things.

542
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,760
 I had no shot at doing any of that.

543
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,920
 But because the Lord was building, those things were able to be accomplished.

544
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,240
 Ask yourself, is this something God is building or something I'm building on my own?

545
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,580
 Because if God is building it, hear this, it will not fail.

546
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,960
 At the same time, it'll probably be hard.

547
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,800
 Like let's not live in a Christian fairy tale where it's like, "God's doing it.

548
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,280
 Therefore, I will have no problems and butterflies and rainbows everywhere."

549
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,560
 That's not our reality.

550
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,520
 See God grows us in that tension.

551
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,760
 God anchors our faith through those difficulties, but he comes through.

552
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,280
 He doesn't start what he's not going to finish.

553
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,840
 That's not our God.

554
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:02,360
 It may look different and it will cost you, but your time and your commitment to God will

555
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,040
 not be in vain.

556
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,520
 So let me give us a couple of things that we can do, a couple of little practical steps

557
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,240
 that we can take in order to address the fear in our hearts, in order to address the anxiety

558
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,360
 that we feel, in order to find some sense of peace and stability here and now.

559
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,560
 The first thing is this, it's a realization that we have to keep with us.

560
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:32,240
 We must first realize that we are positioned for success when we are dependent on God.

561
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,640
 Not when we're dependent on ourselves, not when we're dependent on our paychecks or on

562
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,800
 our GPAs or on the people that we know, but when we are dependent on God.

563
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,680
 God builds and guards by his grace, therefore we need him.

564
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,520
 We need him.

565
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,320
 John would say in the New Testament that apart from him, we can do nothing, right?

566
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,400
 He's the vine where the branch is, apart from him, we can do nothing.

567
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,180
 But then Paul would say that I can do all things through him.

568
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:09,240
 You see that this big thing that we have to have God as a part of it.

569
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,080
 We're dependent on him and one of the best ways that we can be dependent practically,

570
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,040
 I was going to get practical, is this thing called a Sabbath.

571
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,520
 Now I know it's not popular.

572
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,240
 It probably sounds like some old Hebrew word.

573
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,960
 I think it is an old Hebrew word.

574
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,960
 But the Sabbath was instituted from the very beginning for us, for our good.

575
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,800
 We look back at the creation story and we see that after six days of working, God rests.

576
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,480
 And perhaps that is a pattern that we are meant to live within.

577
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:47,360
 Perhaps God is actually asking us to take a day where we don't assume the position of

578
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
 the person who applies or who provides for ourselves.

579
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,080
 Perhaps there's a day where we physically rest, where we mentally rest, where we bring

580
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,880
 our anxieties and our cares to God, where we remember who he is.

581
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,480
 See in the Old Testament, when God's people would rest, God would, he would provide for

582
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
 them.

583
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
 It's interesting.

584
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:13,700
 It requires you to rest before you get that provision, but he will provide.

585
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,920
 Do we have faith enough to take a day, a week, and dedicate it just to remembering that we

586
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,680
 are ever dependent on him?

587
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:30,960
 The second thing, point number two, submitting what we have to him.

588
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,880
 See, submitting is an interesting word because I don't think we fully, I won't use the word

589
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
 submit.

590
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,160
 Let's take what we have and let's bring it to God in prayer.

591
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,640
 That's a bit more straightforward, right?

592
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,600
 Let's bring what we have to God in prayer.

593
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,160
 Maybe you don't know if what you're building is aligned with God.

594
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
 That's okay.

595
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,600
 You can bring it to him in prayer.

596
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
 You can ask him to search your heart.

597
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,940
 David, the man after God's own heart, is the one that writes the Psalms saying, "Search

598
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,760
 my heart.

599
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,680
 Look and see if my motives are clean.

600
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,040
 God, am I aligned with you or am I not?

601
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,160
 I don't want to be building what you have no part of."

602
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,120
 Can we submit ourselves to God in that way?

603
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,520
 One of the ways I think we can do this is through confession, and not just a confession

604
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,960
 of what we've done wrong, but the confession to God of how we actually feel.

605
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,520
 Guys, we're tired.

606
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,920
 It's been a strong and difficult couple of years.

607
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,480
 I don't know how long it's been now.

608
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,000
 It's been a long time.

609
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,520
 Maybe we can get honest with God.

610
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,560
 He doesn't just want to hear your good thoughts and your good prayers.

611
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
 Get real with him.

612
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,640
 Tell him that you hurt.

613
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,160
 Tell him where it hurts and tell him why.

614
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,040
 Tell him the things that are on your heart.

615
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,080
 Bring to him your actual fears.

616
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,260
 Let him know, "God, I'm anxious.

617
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,520
 Could you help me?

618
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,540
 God, I fear.

619
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
 Could you help me?"

620
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
 Guys, he listens.

621
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,600
 Remember what we said earlier, he cares for us.

622
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,340
 We can cast those burdens.

623
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:14,120
 We can bring that stuff to him because he cares for us.

624
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,040
 The third thing I want to say is this.

625
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,280
 Seek him first.

626
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,640
 The idea of striving and worrying and anxiety, trying to control things, is all a coping

627
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,600
 mechanism.

628
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,700
 It's all a coping mechanism.

629
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,680
 It's what happens when we try to meet our needs and protect ourselves, and that's completely

630
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,440
 normal.

631
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,220
 You're not odd for feeling that way.

632
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,800
 But here's the thing, Psalm 127 is telling us that we don't have to feel the pressures

633
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,400
 to do that on our own.

634
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,440
 We're not ultimately responsible for just ourselves.

635
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,900
 Jesus does something really interesting in Matthew 6, piggybacking off of Psalm 127.

636
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,000
 He gives this fantastic example.

637
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,920
 He says, "Look at the flowers."

638
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,640
 These are probably big, tough religious guys.

639
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,960
 He's like, "Look at the flowers."

640
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,080
 So then they all come down and look at the flowers.

641
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
 "Let's look at the flowers."

642
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,500
 He's like, "Look at how they just flower around.

643
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,120
 They just do flower things.

644
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,160
 You don't see flower number one talking to lily number two being stressed.

645
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,760
 You don't hear the rose over here be like, 'My anxiety this week.'"

646
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
 Right?

647
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,760
 Like they just do flowery things, hang out in the wind and sway and get picked by kids.

648
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,800
 But they are flowers, and that's it.

649
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,160
 And yet God provides for them.

650
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,920
 They don't have to worry.

651
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,760
 Guys, flowers don't have to worry.

652
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,040
 And then Jesus is like, "Okay, let's take it a little further.

653
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
 The birds."

654
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
 So they've looked down, now look up.

655
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,520
 "Look at the birds.

656
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,360
 They're just tweeting," and not Twitter, but tweeting.

657
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,700
 They are singing their songs.

658
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,000
 They are being birds.

659
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,120
 They can't populate the ocean with the fish they need.

660
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,860
 They can't populate the ground with the worms they need.

661
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,280
 But they don't stress over it.

662
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,300
 They're not anxious over it.

663
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,820
 God takes care of that for them.

664
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:12,520
 And how much more will your Father in heaven do for you?

665
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,240
 See, it's a really cool principle.

666
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:23,240
 He's calling us not to seek the things we need, but to seek God, to seek Him first.

667
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,600
 So what it comes down to is this.

668
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,680
 It's not by seeking after the things that we need that we're actually built and sustained.

669
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,400
 It's the opposite.

670
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:43,540
 It's by seeking after the builder and the sustainer, focusing on His heart, asking what

671
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:50,620
 He's doing, asking for a new perspective, asking Him to change our hearts.

672
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,140
 That's what the birds do.

673
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,820
 They just do bird things.

674
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,500
 The flowers, they don't have to be anxious.

675
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,540
 They don't have to worry about tomorrow and their needs.

676
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,900
 God does it for them.

677
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,980
 God's building us, guys.

678
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
 He's building us.

679
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,040
 He's building our futures.

680
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,580
 He's finding us where we're weak, and He's saying, "It's okay.

681
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580
 Come.

682
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,740
 Come to me because I can do it.

683
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,740
 I can build.

684
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,720
 Cast your anxieties on me.

685
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,900
 Choose to boast in my strength."

686
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,580
 Do you feel tired?

687
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,620
 Has it been a hard couple of years?

688
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:31,420
 Do you feel like you've hit that spot where there's just nothing left that you can do

689
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,980
 to move forward?

690
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,180
 God invites us to Him when we're there.

691
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:43,700
 He invites us to dependency on Him, yet to a collaboration into these big, eternal things

692
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,140
 that He's building.

693
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,340
 Will we submit ourselves today?

694
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,300
 Will we seek after Him today?

695
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,300
 Let's stand and pray.

696
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,900
 God, we come before You.

697
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,580
 God, we just thank You for Your Word.

698
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:08,220
 We thank You that You are the Creator God, the one who creates and who builds and who

699
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,220
 establishes.

700
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:18,380
 But God, we come to You as people who experience what the world has, and we come to You broken.

701
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,380
 We come to You tired.

702
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,020
 We come to You with actual anxiety.

703
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:28,540
 And we say, "God, come and speak to us.

704
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:34,940
 Come and remind us more deeply, more personally, that You are the God who is for us, that You

705
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:40,980
 are the God who builds, who protects, who what Your hand pushes forward, no one can

706
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
 stop.

707
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:48,620
 Give us the rest that we can find only in You, God."

708
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,260
 Perhaps you're here today and you're just broken.

709
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,340
 You're just tired.

710
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,660
 You don't have much hope left.

711
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,380
 I feel God saying, "You are welcome.

712
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,580
 Come in.

713
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,180
 Come into His rest.

714
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:09,300
 Take off the burdens that you're carrying, for you were never meant to actually carry

715
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,300
 them."

716
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,660
 That's not what He has for you.

717
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,580
 See, He sent Jesus so that He would carry those things for you.

718
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:24,940
 And what that looks like is submitting to Him.

719
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:32,740
 So God, we choose to submit to You today, and we ask Your Spirit to come and to reveal

720
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,420
 to us the things hidden in our hearts, the things that You're calling us to release and

721
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,300
 let go to You.

722
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,300
 Come Holy Spirit.

723
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,780
 Come Holy Spirit.

724
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,360
 (gentle music)
