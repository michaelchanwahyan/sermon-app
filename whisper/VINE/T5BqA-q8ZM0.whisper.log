[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.640]   Amen, amen.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.600]   Okay, can we take our worship team as always?
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.400]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.720]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.440]   As always, we're incredibly full here.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.120]   So as you sit down and you realize
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.780]   that you might have a seat next to you,
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.680]   maybe just raise your hand.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.960]   Our host will try and come and place people in seats.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.540]   We have a couple of seats here.
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.960]   There's one here.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.160]   There's one here, is that one?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.560]   There's one here, you guys.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.160]   (clicking)
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.580]   Anyone else need a seat?
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.920]   There's some seats around.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.960]   If you're new to The Vine, welcome.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.780]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.620]   My name's Andrew.
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.400]   I'm one of the pastors here,
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.080]   and we're glad that you guys are a part
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.280]   of what we're doing here at The Vine.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.480]   And if you're joining us online,
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.800]   welcome for wherever it is that you're tuning in online.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.360]   We're in week three of a four-week series
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.440]   that we're starting at the beginning of this year,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.400]   where we're looking at this idea
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.760]   that there are four mindset shifts
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.300]   that we need as people
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.360]   if we're gonna transition from the year of 2024,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.540]   which here at The Vine was a year of intimacy with Jesus,
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.080]   to a year of what we're saying 2025 is about,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.760]   a year of harvest, a year of birthing, a year of action.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.160]   If we're gonna move from a place of intimacy
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.800]   to a place of action,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.680]   there are four mindset shifts that are needed
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.360]   for us to move into all that God has for this year.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.400]   And so this series,
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.600]   we're basing in the lives of Samuel and David,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.280]   and we're looking at a very critical time
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.900]   of biblical history,
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.400]   the time where at the end of Samuel's life,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.480]   he finishes his work as a judge
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.220]   and he anoints first Saul to be king,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.200]   and then he anoints David to be king.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.480]   And then David begins this moment in his life
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.880]   where he's preparing himself to become the king
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.200]   that the Jewish people in the Old Testament speak of
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.600]   as this Davidic dynasty.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.200]   This time where the bloodline of David himself
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.680]   will go all the way to bringing in Jesus Christ.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.040]   That moment of history
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.400]   is what we're looking at over this series.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.100]   And it's such a critical moment
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.460]   because there is a transition that happens
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.520]   for both Samuel and David
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.040]   from a place of deep intimacy with the Lord
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.180]   to a place of being used by him
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.060]   to use their story for his glory.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.500]   And as we dive into this,
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.140]   as I was just saying a moment ago,
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.920]   it's so easy for us to end up living someone else's story.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.500]   It was tempting for Samuel and for David
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.180]   to remain in the story
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.100]   that someone else had written for them
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.740]   rather than release themselves
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.580]   with courage and boldness and bravery
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.180]   into the story God was asking them to live.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.060]   And I honestly wanna just say one more time,
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.260]   as I look over you guys,
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.900]   I have such a burden in my heart.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.700]   I'm so excited about the potential that is in this room,
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.420]   about the stories that God is already writing
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.580]   on your lives and in your hearts.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.040]   And I believe that we can be released
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.300]   into that story even more
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.960]   as we open ourselves to what happens here.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.440]   In the first week of this series,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.920]   we talked about what it is to have a right start,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   how we can position ourselves to begin the journey well.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.160]   Last week, Ellison took us through this incredible message
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160]   where he spoke to us
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.040]   about the power of making the right choices,
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.400]   not only realizing that we need to start
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.240]   from the right place,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.260]   but we need to make the right choices
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.600]   in the journey that we're in.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Today, I wanna talk to you about wearing the right clothes.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.840]   That's right, the right clothes.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.380]   Now, what on earth is that all about?
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.180]   Well, to understand that,
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.120]   we need to pick up the story
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.680]   from where Ellison left off last week.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.040]   We saw at the end of last week
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.100]   that Samuel pours out that oil,
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.680]   the horn that he had filled with oil,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   he pours it out over the top of David
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.760]   and he makes the right choice.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.040]   He doesn't look by the surface of things,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.040]   he looks in the heart and he chooses David.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.340]   He pours and he anoints David to become king.
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.480]   Now, here's the fascinating thing.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.880]   I want you to hear this.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.000]   David doesn't actually become king for another 12 years.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.720]   It's really fascinating that.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.800]   There's actually a whole sermon here
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.000]   that I don't have time to preach right now,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.160]   but I'm gonna preach you the minimum sermon, okay?
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.360]   I'll preach you like the one minute version of that sermon.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.600]   Just because God has anointed you for a task
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.800]   doesn't necessarily mean that it's the right time
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.860]   to start that task.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.360]   Because you see, David was anointed to be king,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.600]   but it would be 12 years
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.160]   before he actually became king of Israel.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.600]   And if David's anything like me,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.760]   there's a lot of frustration in that break,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.280]   between I'm anointed, God's called me,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.360]   God's asked me to do something,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.340]   but it's 12 long years before I can actually do it.
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.760]   But God understood that David needed some training.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.400]   He understood that there needed to be a season
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.560]   of waiting in David's life.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.040]   He knew that actually David needed a time
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.000]   to embrace the character by which he would need
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.960]   to hold him in the place of anointing.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.360]   And although he was anointed 12 years,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.800]   he would then have the character and the skill
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.480]   and the vision to be able to stand as king
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.840]   and be one of the greatest kings that Israel has ever had.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.800]   Some of you right now, you've been anointed for a task,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.080]   but it's not necessarily the right time
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.960]   for you to move into that task.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.520]   There's a time of anointing,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.960]   and then there's a time of waiting.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.680]   And then there's sometimes a time of learning,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.360]   and then some discipleship, and a time of equipping,
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.340]   and then a time of releasing.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.320]   So David is anointed to be king, but there's this period.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.200]   And what happens in that period is that Saul
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.120]   invites David into his household.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.480]   This is really interesting because Saul sees in David
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.360]   that there is this incredible potential in him,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.200]   and he invites him in.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.320]   Now, the reason why he invites him in
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.520]   is because Saul at this time
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.000]   is having demonic manifestations.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.320]   He's struggling with a demonic spirit,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.280]   and only when David plays a harp
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.720]   does that demonic spirit quieten in his life.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.080]   And so he brings David in,
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.840]   and anytime he feels this demonic spirit coming on him,
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.080]   he asks David to play the harp,
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.140]   and David plays the harp, and it chills him out.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.120]   Now, Saul is so pleased with this.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.960]   In fact, the Scriptures say that he so likes David
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.880]   that he makes David his personal armor bearer.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.800]   Now, this has a lot to do with what I'm gonna say,
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.400]   so just listen to this for a moment.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.360]   He makes David his personal armor bearer.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.080]   What that means is that David was responsible
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.880]   for Saul's battle armor.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.060]   So whether that was his tunic that he would wear under it,
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.800]   the armor itself, the weapons of battle
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.640]   that the king would have,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.280]   it was David's responsibility to make sure
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.840]   that those things were always battle-ready,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.240]   so to make sure that the sword was always sharp,
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.340]   to make sure that the tunic was always folded neatly,
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.400]   to make sure that the armor was prepared and oiled rightly
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.640]   so it would move with flexibility on the battlefield.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.160]   It was David's responsibility to prepare the armor
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.640]   for whatever battle might come.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.160]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.200]   Now, interestingly, a battle comes.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.080]   In fact, very soon after he's made armor bearer,
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.680]   just as these sort of stories go,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.120]   suddenly a nation rises up to attack Israel.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's the nation of Philistia.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.520]   And Philistia rises up and goes to the borders
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.600]   of Israel's land and threatens to attack Israel.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.920]   So Israel's army move up towards the borders,
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.960]   and there's this standoff on the border.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   Now, here's the interesting thing.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   In those days, battles could actually be fought
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.760]   by a peculiar kind of custom.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.680]   What it was is that one kind of warrior from one side
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   and one warrior from the other side could fight,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.900]   and whoever won that battle, the whole nation wins.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.440]   So it was a way of kind of making sure
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.400]   there wasn't like bloodshed for everybody
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.040]   in this long protracted war.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.120]   Just one warrior versus one warrior, fight it out,
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.040]   and then the nation, whoever warrior stands
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.520]   at the end of it, the nation wins.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.040]   This is what happens.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.560]   So Philistia sends forward their best warrior.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.520]   You probably know this story.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.040]   His name's Goliath.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.840]   Goliath is described in the Bible as being nine feet tall.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.240]   Don't ask me to explain that.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.480]   He is nine feet tall, and he is terrifying.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.400]   And the Bible says that he's been a champion
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   since his youth.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.700]   Now, this is interesting because Israel's response,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.660]   the Scriptures write this,
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.440]   Israel's response is one of fear and dismay.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.200]   They look at the nine foot giant
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.000]   who's been a warrior since youth,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.320]   and they're thinking maybe it's better
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.760]   of the whole army's battle right now,
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.480]   'cause if one of us has to go against that one,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.960]   there's no way this is gonna work out for us.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.560]   And they're so filled with fear that nobody in Israel
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.120]   is willing to put their hand up to fight Goliath.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.720]   And so the Bible says for 40 days,
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   Goliath would come to the edge of the battlefield,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.040]   dressed in all of his armor,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.880]   and he would shout at the Israelites
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.280]   who were about 100 whatever yards away,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.480]   and he would shout and say,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.560]   isn't anybody willing to come and fight me?
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.020]   Are you all chickens?
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.240]   Are you all feeble?
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.400]   And then he would shout down Israel's God.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.320]   Your God is nothing, blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.880]   He would come and say all this verbal insults
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.840]   to the people, and for 40 days, Israel just sat in terror.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.320]   Until one day, when David is so frustrated
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.800]   that no one is doing anything, that he decides to act.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.560]   He's like, well, if none of you are gonna do it,
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.560]   well then, then I'll do it.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.600]   And he starts to think,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.040]   well, maybe I can go before this Philistine.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.240]   He's just an uncircumcised Philistine.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.520]   He doesn't have the power of God behind him.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.520]   He represents something that is uncircumcised,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.640]   something that is defiled,
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.600]   and he's standing before us and defiling the name of our God.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.520]   This cannot happen.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.920]   And so he goes to Saul and he says, I'll fight him.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.280]   And Saul looks at him and says, no, you won't.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.520]   Like, 'cause if you go, this whole thing's over.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.280]   Like, if you go, we'll lose everything.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.080]   He literally says, you're just a boy.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.240]   Like, you're my armor bearer.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.200]   That's basically like, it's like, you're not even,
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.080]   like, you've never been trained for war.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.560]   You're not a warrior.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.880]   You're not even a trainer.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.160]   It's like, you know, in boxing,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.400]   there's like the one guy that like tapes the gloves
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.040]   around the boxer's arms, right?
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.880]   That's basically David, right?
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.760]   And so Saul's like, sensibly, no, no, no, no,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.800]   you're not gonna do this.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.680]   And then David, I love the courage of David.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.560]   He goes through his resume.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.600]   Ever done this with someone?
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.920]   Oh, but you don't know who I really am.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.800]   You don't understand that I'm a shepherd.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.680]   You can imagine Saul going, great,
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.280]   that's gonna work really well.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.960]   He's like, I'm a shepherd, right?
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   Like, and he said, you gotta understand,
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.720]   I tend the flocks of my father,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.920]   and when the bears come, and when the lions come,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   I run after them, and I defeat them.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.960]   I kill them.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.680]   And this Philistine, this Goliath,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.960]   he's just like an oversized bear.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.520]   He's like an oversized lion.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.760]   If you let me, I will go and fight him.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.120]   And for some reason, the Bible doesn't tell us why,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.240]   Saul changes his mind, and he says, okay, then, go.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.760]   And you're like, hang on, at this point in the story,
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.920]   you're like, what is going on here?
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.520]   Here's what I think is going on.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.560]   Saul realizes that because none of his army
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.440]   is going to fight, everybody's looking at him to fight.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:39.400]   And he's so afraid himself to fight
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.520]   that he's willing to let a shepherd boy go fight.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   Great leadership.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.880]   [audience laughing]
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   So, so we know the rest of the story, don't we?
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.840]   He lets David go.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.800]   David puts five little pebbles in his pouch,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.920]   and he takes his staff, and he takes his shepherd's bag,
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.760]   and he runs after Goliath, and he says,
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.360]   you're just a stinky, little, uncircumcised Gentile.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.920]   [imitates gun firing]
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.720]   Hits him first try, stone in the forehead.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.040]   Doesn't kill him with that shot.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.880]   He falls on the ground and literally is passed out.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.320]   And then he takes a sword, and he cuts off Goliath's head.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.360]   That's what kills him, cuts off his head.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.960]   And he holds his head up in front of everybody,
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.400]   and he says, look what my God has done.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.760]   And we have, for all history,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.600]   one of the greatest stories of an underdog
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.960]   winning for everyone, amen?
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.880]   There's a moment in the story, though.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.400]   There's this moment in the story
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.920]   that is the real reason why I think
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.160]   David actually wins the battle.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.760]   And it's not because he has these five stones in a sling,
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.040]   and he has his shepherd's staff,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.040]   and he has a sword that he cuts his head off.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.040]   Actually, I think he wins the battle much earlier than that.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.640]   And there's this little part in the story
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.560]   that is very often overlooked.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.120]   In fact, most of the times the story's told,
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.240]   this part isn't even told with it.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.880]   But I think it's this moment in the story
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.320]   where actually the victory takes place.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.400]   And I think if we can understand the principle
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.560]   of what David does in this part of the story,
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.640]   it might actually set you up for the battle
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.720]   that God has put before you.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.800]   So I wonder whether we could look at this
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.160]   little moment in the story.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.200]   We're gonna jump back to the moment
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.760]   where David is giving his resume to Saul
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.240]   about being a shepherd.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.200]   So this is picking up in 1 Samuel 17,
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.360]   starting in verse 34.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.080]   But David said to Saul,
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.200]   "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.520]   "When a lion or a bear came and carried the sheep
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.640]   "from the flock, I went after it,
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.800]   "struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.320]   "When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair,
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.960]   "struck it and killed it.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.080]   "Your servant has killed both lion and bear.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.240]   "The uncircumcised Philistine, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.920]   "will be like one of them,
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   "because he has defiled the armies of the living God.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.600]   "The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.760]   "and the paw of the bear will deliver me
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.200]   "from the hand of this Philistine."
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.120]   So Saul said to David, "Go."
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.840]   And the Lord be with you.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.080]   Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.680]   He put a coat of armor on him
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.680]   and a bronze helmet on his head.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.560]   David fastened on his sword over the tunic
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.800]   and tried to walk around because he was not used to them.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.120]   "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.720]   "because I'm not used to them."
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.240]   So he took them off.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.760]   Then he took up his staff in his hand
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.520]   and he chose five smooth stones from the stream
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.160]   and he put them in his pouch of his shepherd's bag.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.720]   And then with his sling in his hand,
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.160]   he approached the Philistine.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.560]   There's this beautiful moment that happens here
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.400]   where Saul finally says, "Okay, you're gonna go
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.840]   "because I don't wanna fight, so you're gonna go."
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.040]   And he says these really quite important words.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.880]   He says, "Go in the Lord."
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.520]   Doesn't that sound great?
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.260]   Doesn't that sound faithful?
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.920]   But he does this really interesting thing.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   He says to David, "Go in the Lord,"
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.440]   but then he does immediately something
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.760]   that seems to contradict that very thing.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.600]   Notice this.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.280]   He says, "Go in the Lord,"
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.400]   and then he dresses him like himself.
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.120]   He says, "Go in the Lord, but I want you to look like me."
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.400]   Go in the Lord, but you're gonna wear my clothes.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.560]   Are you following?
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.760]   Which seems kind of contradictory
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.840]   'cause you just told me to go in the Lord,
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.300]   but now you're telling me how you want me to go.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.320]   I thought this was the Lord,
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.400]   but now you're making this again about yourself.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.920]   But I want you to see what happens here.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   He says, literally, it says,
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.880]   "Saul, then dress David in his tunic."
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.200]   It's like Saul, his thinking is this.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.520]   Now notice this, don't be upset at Saul
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.980]   because Saul loves David, remember?
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.740]   And Saul's sending David into a battle
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.920]   that he thinks David is not gonna win.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.060]   So he wants to set David up for success.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.220]   His intentions are really good.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.220]   Are you following this?
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.660]   His intentions are pure.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.100]   He says, "Look, you're gonna go into battle,
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.700]   "and I know that's gonna be hard
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.080]   "because there's a nine-foot guy
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.360]   "and you're just a shepherd's boy,
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.620]   "so you're probably gonna lose,
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.040]   "but I wanna give you the best thing I can give you.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.580]   "I wanna help you to be best prepared
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.780]   "for the battle that's ahead.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.100]   "I wanna do all that I can."
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.940]   So you know what?
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.620]   I'm gonna give you my armor.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.580]   This is the best armor in Israel.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.180]   Nobody else's armor like this.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.260]   In fact, no one in the history of Israel
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.500]   has ever worn the king's armor.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.700]   It's reserved specifically for the king.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.940]   It's the nicest, most expensive, best prepared.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.540]   It is the best armor that they could possibly be made.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.120]   And my heart for you, David, is that you would succeed.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.060]   So I'm gonna give you the best of myself,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.140]   the best of me to you,
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.620]   so that you can do your best on the battlefield.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.140]   His heart and his intentions are good.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.300]   Do you follow that?
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.660]   But notice what the Bible tells us
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.420]   about the physical stature between Saul and David.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.140]   Saul, we're described a couple of chapters earlier
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.180]   as head and shoulders above everybody else in Israel.
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.340]   He was tall, he was broad, he was big, he was muscular.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.540]   And then we learned that David himself
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.460]   was small of stature, was a little boy,
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.140]   didn't have much muscle.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.860]   You could think the two of them are like peas apart.
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.520]   Like way apart.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.500]   So when Saul goes,
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.220]   "Here's the best thing I wanna do for you.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.080]   "I want you to take the best of me.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.260]   "I'm gonna put it on you,
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.720]   "so that you can kind of wear it in the battlefield."
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.680]   It was literally like if somebody came to me and said,
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.480]   "Andrew, I've got this beautiful jacket
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.020]   "that's really expensive, and I want you to put it on
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.880]   "'cause you're gonna look awesome
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.420]   "when you preach on a Sunday."
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.980]   And you put it on, and you're suddenly MC Hammer.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.780]   That's a reference from my era, by the way.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.580]   But you suddenly put it on, and you can imagine David,
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.620]   he's honored.
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.900]   Follow this, church.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.160]   He's honored because Saul has looked at him and said,
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.140]   "I want the best for you."
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.320]   And David loves Saul too.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.860]   And so he takes on what it is that Saul wants to give him,
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.900]   and he puts it on.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.420]   But you can almost see him putting it on,
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.520]   and Saul going,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.060]   and David going like this, you know?
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.820]   Because he realizes that the tunic wasn't made for him.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.700]   It wasn't designed for him.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.900]   It didn't fit him, are you with me?
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.980]   It was comfortable for Saul.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.980]   It was the best armor possible, but it fitted Saul.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.900]   It didn't fit David.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.220]   And yet now David's wearing it, and David's thinking,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.080]   "Well, he's got the right heart for me.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.140]   "He's got the right intentions for me.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.680]   "I don't wanna upset him.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.940]   "I don't wanna put him off, so I'll take it, I'll wear it."
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.860]   But suddenly he's like, "Hang on a sec.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.940]   "This does not feel right for me."
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.300]   I want you to see this.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   See, David is dressed for the right battle.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.140]   He's just wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.820]   Like he knew the battle was the one
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.580]   that God was calling him into.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.420]   He knew that he was being released to fight this.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.860]   He had the courage to believe that if God was with him,
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.980]   the battle would be won,
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.340]   but he's suddenly dressed in the wrong clothes.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:43.660]   See, this is 2025, and if you live here in Hong Kong,
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.540]   if this is your home city,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.700]   if this is where you work and where you live
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.020]   and God has planted you here,
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.980]   I want you to hear this.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.420]   No matter how you feel about Hong Kong,
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.860]   no matter whether you like it or you don't,
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.180]   whether you wanna be here forever or you don't,
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.060]   whether you're excited about its future or not,
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.880]   you need to understand
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.760]   that if this is where you are currently living,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.220]   you are in the right battle.
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.540]   Like this land, this place,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.180]   is the place where he wants to use your God-given gifts,
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.420]   your talents, your heart,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.940]   to sow the gospel into this land.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.260]   He wants you to fight with love and justice
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.980]   and heart and forgiveness.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.500]   He wants you to bring the gospel
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.060]   into your sphere of influence.
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.140]   You are in the right battle.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.540]   My question to you is,
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.340]   are you wearing the right clothes?
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.580]   Because you can be in the right battle,
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.900]   but wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.460]   And David sort of realized that he was in a situation
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.880]   where things didn't quite seem to be right for him.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.320]   And it's really important that we come to recognize
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.040]   that this doesn't just happen for David.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.400]   This happens for all of us.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.880]   That oftentimes, people in our lives
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   who are really well-intentioned,
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.400]   who actually love us,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.200]   who want the best for us,
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.860]   they want us to win our battle,
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.160]   they put their clothes on us.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.760]   Because they love you and they want you to succeed.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.880]   They want you to win the battle.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.240]   And from their perspective,
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.200]   if only you could be a bit more like this,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.080]   if only you could look a little bit more like this,
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.680]   if only you could act a bit more like this,
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.880]   then you will actually survive and thrive in this world.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.300]   So there are people with good intentions
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.200]   that will try to put their clothes on us that don't fit.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.300]   Are you with me?
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.800]   But there are also people with bad intentions,
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.240]   people that don't have our best in mind,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.040]   people that actually want us to fail,
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.680]   that don't want us to succeed.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.580]   David had someone who wanted his best.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.120]   We can often have people that don't want our best,
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.360]   and they're still putting their clothes on us.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.040]   What sort of clothes do people place on us?
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.520]   Well, let me go to my clothes rack
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.680]   and show you some of the clothes
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.540]   that I think people place on us.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.640]   I think, first of all,
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.200]   they place their own expectations on us.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.400]   They place their expectations,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.560]   the thoughts that they have
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.200]   about what they're expecting you to do,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.920]   how they expect you to act in certain situations,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.280]   and how they expect you to be.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.060]   And they have their own expectations
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.200]   for what they think is best.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.060]   And again, it can come from a good place,
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.260]   but it can also come from a bad place.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.820]   Either way, there are many of us in this room
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.540]   who are wearing somebody else's expectations,
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.460]   and it's weighing us down.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.300]   Guess what?
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.500]   It doesn't fit,
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.740]   'cause it's not the expectation
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.660]   that God has asked you to wear.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.700]   But you've put on somebody else's expectations.
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.740]   They've put those things on you,
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.220]   and you're now wearing them,
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.320]   and you're wondering why you're exhausted.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.700]   What other clothes do we wear?
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.220]   I think sometimes we do this.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.680]   We wear the values of others.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.100]   Other people put their values upon us.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.800]   Hey, this is how you should be.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.460]   This is what you should stand for in this world.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.940]   Hey, you should just sleep around.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.420]   Everybody else is doing it.
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.260]   Hey, it's fine.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.080]   I know you're a Christian,
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.920]   but hey, guess what?
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.020]   There's this really hot girl in the office in Singapore.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.300]   I can hook you up when you're next there
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.260]   on a business trip.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.080]   My values are the best values for you.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.740]   And if only you could live a little bit more
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.160]   with my values in mind,
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.340]   I think your life would go a little bit better.
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.500]   And so whether we're good intentions or bad intentions,
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.460]   some of us in this room,
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.020]   we're wearing the values
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.740]   that we're not supposed to be wearing,
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.700]   the values that somebody else has placed upon our shoulders.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.220]   Are you with me?
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.580]   Or if I can get a little bit more personal
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.180]   with us in our culture here in Hong Kong,
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.780]   look at all of these ones right here.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.580]   Maybe some well-intentioned people in our lives
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.380]   have said, "Here's the university you should go to."
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.680]   Hey, if you just do the good grades,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.460]   you'll get this university.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.420]   Or maybe they're like, "Hey, here's the career.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.200]   "You know, I know you are a dancer and you love to dance,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.040]   "but guess what?
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.860]   "You're a lawyer.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.820]   "You're a banker.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.740]   "I know this 'cause I've seen your future.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.940]   "And I know what's best for you.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.080]   "You know, if you tried to dance,
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.800]   "you're gonna be unemployed working in Starbucks.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.080]   "You don't wanna work in Starbucks.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.240]   "Forget the creative arts.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.600]   "Look, you can do that as a hobby,
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.800]   "but you're a lawyer."
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.040]   Or maybe someone said like,
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   "Hey, here's the person you should marry."
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.120]   Oh yeah, I've got the person for you.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.200]   You should marry this person because of what they can do.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.040]   Or here's the company that you should work for.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.900]   You're getting the point, right?
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.220]   So we have all these things, all these clothes
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.240]   that other people have placed upon us
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.200]   that we've either accepted and they've either done it
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.520]   because they love us or they've done it
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.720]   because they don't love us and they want us to fail.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.520]   Either way, we're wearing stuff that doesn't fit
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.460]   and we're dressed for the right battle
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.840]   and we're wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.440]   And if 2025 is gonna be a year of harvest
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.600]   and growth for us, if we're gonna be living our faith
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.280]   more publicly in the world around us,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.760]   then we need to realize that we're sometimes not dressed
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.720]   in the right way for the battle that we've been placed in.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.120]   Now, I want you to also hear this.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.080]   This doesn't just happen
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.840]   because other people place their expectations,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.920]   their choices or their values on us.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.720]   This also happens because we take other people's
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.280]   expectations.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.720]   We take other people's values
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.160]   and we place them on our own shoulders.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.720]   So sometimes it happens because somebody does it to you.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.080]   And some of you in this room,
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.880]   maybe you're well-meaning and well-loved parents
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.680]   or maybe it was a boss or maybe it was someone in your life,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.000]   maybe it was a past relationship.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.600]   They've placed some expectations and choices on you
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.760]   and it's weighing you down.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.080]   But the reality is for a lot of us,
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.880]   we place those things on ourselves.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.400]   Let me tell you this.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.680]   I became senior pastor here at the Vine in 2013.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.400]   And in 2013, I was 37 years old, don't do the math,
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.720]   but I was 37 years old at the time.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.840]   And John and Tony, who are our previous senior pastors here,
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.040]   they did a fantastic job of taking a church of 40 people
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.440]   and growing it into this big
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.020]   and successful church in Hong Kong.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.960]   And I was 37 years old
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.060]   and I had no idea how to be a senior pastor.
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.060]   I mean, I'd been to Bible school, I'd been prepared,
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.000]   they had done a great job preparing me.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.520]   But as I stepped into the role,
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.440]   I felt overwhelmed with what it was.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.560]   And I thought, I'm gonna be the senior pastor,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.880]   the first in the Vine's history
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.240]   who's gonna take the church off the cliff.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.940]   And the church has had this kind of trajectory growth
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.240]   since day one and then Andrew takes over.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.400]   Are you with me?
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.240]   And now, hear this,
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.840]   John and Tony didn't put any expectations on my shoulders.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.600]   I mean, I'm sure they had dreams for me
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.080]   and they had dreams for the church,
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.020]   but one of the things that they did
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.480]   most powerfully and beautifully
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.860]   is when I became senior pastor,
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.280]   they were like, be your man.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.160]   Follow your dreams, listen to the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.240]   They did all the right things.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.880]   I did the wrong things.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.880]   I was the one like, well, the Vine has always been this way.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.560]   John and Tony have always done it this way.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.040]   And if we're gonna continue to be successful,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.920]   I guess we're gonna have to do it that way.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.640]   And although maybe I've got some new ideas,
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   I think actually I've got more fear in me than faith in me.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.280]   And that fear is causing me to take on board what they did
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.480]   and try to be the same senior pastor that they were.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.000]   And after a year of this,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.320]   I was so emotionally and spiritually exhausted.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.960]   I took my wife out for dinner.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.840]   We sat down at this very public restaurant
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.760]   and I just started weeping like a baby in the restaurant.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.200]   Everybody was looking at me like,
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.640]   what is going on with that guy?
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.160]   And I just started crying and crying.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.400]   And I said to my wife, I said,
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.340]   what if I'm the first person in the history of this church,
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.840]   the first leader that actually ruins this church?
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.040]   What if people stop coming?
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:08.920]   What if people leave?
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.360]   What if we don't get our debts sorted out?
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.520]   What if all of this stuff happens?
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.240]   And I had all these fears in me
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.380]   'cause I had taken on someone else's expectations
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.260]   that I had chosen to wear myself,
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.280]   even when they weren't asking me to wear it.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.160]   And my wife said something very important.
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.600]   She said, how long are you gonna go
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.700]   trying to pretend to be someone you're not?
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.280]   I wanna say that over some of you here this morning.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.080]   How long are you gonna go
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.360]   trying to be actually someone you're not
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.700]   and instead try to be someone
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.400]   that someone else wants you to be?
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.920]   And David had to realize, hang on a sec,
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.640]   something's not quite right here.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.920]   I want you to hear it this way.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.120]   You cannot go into your battle
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.060]   wearing someone else's armor.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.700]   I'm gonna say that one more time.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.260]   You cannot go into your battle
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.380]   wearing someone else's armor.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.180]   That never works.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.240]   So what do we do?
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.140]   Notice what David does in verse 39.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:06.980]   It says this.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.180]   David fastened on a sword over his tunic
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.620]   and tried to walk around because he was not used to them.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.460]   And then he says this.
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.340]   I cannot go in these, he said to Saul,
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.860]   because I'm not used to them.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.440]   Can you see the courage that sits in David?
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.860]   Remember, David respected and loved Saul.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.640]   And he so honored and respected him
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.320]   that he was very conscious of that.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.780]   But notice what David does here.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.080]   He doesn't honor and respect Saul greater
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.920]   than his conviction that God is calling him
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.720]   to live a life how he should be living it.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.180]   He honors and respects Saul,
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.480]   but that honor and respect is not greater
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.680]   than his faithfulness to be committed and convicted
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.460]   to live how God's called him to live.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.760]   So he takes the oversized jacket,
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.960]   he puts it on, he walks around,
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.520]   and then he has the courage in him
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.240]   to humbly, beautifully, kindly go up to Saul
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.440]   and say, Saul, I cannot go in these.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.080]   I love you.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.920]   I love you.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.620]   And I know you have my best intentions in mind,
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.540]   but I cannot go in these.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.600]   And I want you to hear this.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.400]   Some of you here at the beginning of 2025,
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.280]   you've been wearing other people's expectations
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.320]   far too long.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.480]   You've been wearing the heavy garments,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.040]   the heavy clothes of other people's choices,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.080]   of how other people want you to be,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.040]   of how the dreams that they've had in their heart for you,
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.920]   and you've been sat under the weight
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.680]   of somebody else's dreams.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.240]   And perhaps at the beginning of this year,
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.880]   you need to find the courage to say,
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.280]   I cannot any longer go in these.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.480]   I cannot any longer go forward wearing
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.840]   what other people have asked me to wear.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.160]   And I know they did it out of good intentions.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.680]   I know they love me deeply.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.080]   I know they want my best,
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.000]   but just like David does to Saul,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.680]   I can't, I can't go in these.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.720]   I'm just not used to them.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.960]   They're not me, they're you.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.480]   And they served you well.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.520]   This battle armor was custom made for you.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.120]   It served you well, but it will not serve me.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:07.940]   David understood.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.600]   He was more in danger in the battlefield
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.820]   wearing Saul's armor than in the courage to actually say,
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.360]   this is not gonna work for me.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.560]   Oh, that we would get a spirit inside of us
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.520]   here at the Vine, where because we wanna go forward,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.680]   because we wanna move,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.560]   because we want the gospel to change our city,
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.720]   because we're so excited about how God's at work
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.040]   in the people around us,
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.200]   that we would realize that we need to take ownership
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.160]   of the clothes that we're wearing and decide,
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.200]   I am not gonna take another step forward.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.400]   I'm not gonna move another inch forward.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.620]   I'm not gonna go forward this year
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.580]   in the clothes that other people want me to wear.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.980]   I cannot go in these.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.020]   That prophetic prayer,
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.380]   that prophetic utterance in our hearts changes everything.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:02.700]   And it changes everything for David.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.740]   Do you know what he does next?
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.560]   Follow this.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.880]   Is this helpful so far?
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.720]   Follow this.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.540]   Look what he says here.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.100]   I love this.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.180]   In verse 39, he says,
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.620]   I cannot go in these, said Saul,
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.700]   because I'm not used to them.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.180]   So he took them off.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.580]   Everybody say amen.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.620]   He took them off.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.800]   Simple.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.860]   So simple.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.220]   I wish I could give you a more complicated process,
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.540]   but here's the reality.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   If you're wearing somebody else's clothes, take them off.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.140]   First of all, you have to go, I cannot go in these.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.420]   That's the first step,
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.160]   to realize this is not what I was designed to carry,
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.000]   to wear.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.300]   I look kind of ridiculous in these.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.420]   Then the second thing is, take them off.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.820]   Now, this is really interesting,
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.460]   'cause it sounds so simple, doesn't it?
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.060]   Just take them off.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.400]   But if it's so simple, why do most of us fail to do it?
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.080]   Because if you're anything like me,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.940]   so often we actually fail to remove the clothes
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.120]   that we know we shouldn't be wearing.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.860]   Those false expectations that have been placed on us.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.260]   Those values that other people want us to live.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.620]   Why is it that it's simple to take them off,
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.500]   but we very rarely do take them off?
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.180]   And instead, we live in the opposite of this.
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.140]   Instead, rather than take off the old,
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.980]   here's what we do.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.820]   I'm just gonna put on the new.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:17.780]   Like, I know I'm wearing stuff
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.940]   that I shouldn't be able to wear,
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.780]   but maybe I could just put on the new thing,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.160]   and in putting on the new thing,
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.360]   no one will know that I'm still wearing the old.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.300]   See, I think us Christians, we're good at this,
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.220]   'cause we're like, look, I know that there is
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.100]   this beautiful custom-made gown or jacket
[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.940]   that God's made for me.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.360]   This jacket, guys, was tailor-made for me.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.340]   My wife tailor-made this jacket for me.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.300]   Oh, this was expensive.
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.340]   This thing fits me like a glove.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.740]   This thing's perfect for me.
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.460]   And as Christians, as we come into faith,
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.580]   we're like, Christ has his righteousness for us.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.860]   Christ has his grace for us, his forgiveness for us.
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.100]   Christ has all these things that he wants us to be.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.840]   He's got values and expectations
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.420]   that are given to flourish us,
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.300]   and we know as Christians that Christ has done this,
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.380]   and so here's what it is.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.500]   We're wearing our old self, but we're like,
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.740]   I'm just gonna put on the new self,
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.860]   and if I put on the new self well enough,
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.720]   no one will know that I'm wearing the old.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:19.340]   So we show up in church on Sunday wearing our new coat,
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.520]   custom-made for us 'cause of the blood of Jesus
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.040]   poured out into our lives.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.820]   The cross paid the price so that I could be free
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.500]   in the expectations of Christ,
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.620]   and no one notices that I'm still wearing the old coat.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.900]   I hope no one sees it.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.740]   Maybe they see it.
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.140]   Maybe I'll just raise my hands a little bit more,
[00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.580]   and then no one will see it at all.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.580]   And the thing is, we think that actually
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.560]   we can get away with two coats on.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.240]   Here's the thing.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.180]   Then we go into our offices,
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.100]   or we go into our social circles
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.660]   outside of our community of faith,
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.840]   and we're like this.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.220]   And we play down the Christian bit, you know?
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.580]   And we just embrace the other jacket that we've always had,
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.740]   and it's like, hey, I'm just like you.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.380]   I look good just like you.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.620]   Are you with me?
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.140]   And we begin to sort of show that,
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:06.740]   or think that we're showing that we're a certain way
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.180]   and that this is the way we should be.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.620]   You can't really see my Christian thing.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.940]   Oh, and then somebody comes around the corner
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.760]   and goes to the vine.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.980]   Oh, hi, how are you?
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.900]   Yeah, it's great to,
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.860]   [audience laughing]
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.820]   great to see you again.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.980]   Nice to have you here.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.460]   Yeah, good.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.300]   Praise Jesus.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.120]   Have a good day.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.980]   [audience laughing]
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.980]   I joke, but I do this, and I'm a pastor.
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.340]   I found myself doing this at times.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.740]   Perhaps you found yourself doing this at times.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:37.100]   Why is it that we know we should take off the old clothes,
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.180]   but we actually just try to hide the old clothes?
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.260]   That we think Jesus will just cover everything up for us,
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.260]   and it'll be okay,
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.340]   even though we're still committed to two sets of values,
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.460]   two sets of choices, two sets of decisions.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.620]   We've begun to define ourselves in that way.
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.260]   And we need to break out of this.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.740]   David says, no, no, I'm gonna actually,
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.140]   as much as I love you, Saul,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.300]   I respect you, I honor you,
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.540]   but you know what, I cannot go in these.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.260]   I cannot go kind of holding two things of value
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:09.100]   at the same time.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.900]   I need to kind of take these things off,
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.780]   and I need to change how I am,
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.260]   because you know what, it's just not me,
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.340]   and I know it's you,
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.700]   and I know you've got my best intentions.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.260]   I know you love me, but you've gotta let me be me.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.060]   Gotta let me be the way that Christ has called me to be.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:26.260]   And I accept you, I love you, I honor you,
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.860]   but I cannot go in these.
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.540]   I take them off before I put anything else on.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.460]   Some of you just need to realize
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.820]   that you've been trying to wear two jackets for too long,
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.940]   and that is not gonna help you
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.900]   to move forward in Christ in 2025.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.860]   You cannot be a witness for Christ in public
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.180]   with your faith wearing two jackets.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.380]   You know what people call that?
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.980]   Hypocrisy.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.500]   And hypocrisy has killed the church
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.180]   so many times over 2,000 years.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.220]   I do not want us at the Vine to be hypocrites.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.420]   So let me challenge you strongly.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.940]   Take off the old clothes.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.060]   Have the courage and the bravery to remove them.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.780]   Now, also follow this.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.180]   Notice what happens next here from David.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:14.540]   He takes off his clothes, and he says in verse 40,
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.780]   "Then he took his staff in his hand,
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.780]   "and he chose five smooth stones from the stream,
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.180]   "and he put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag."
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.180]   Notice this, he takes off the old clothes,
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:26.980]   but he doesn't stand around naked.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.580]   The call is not to nakedness.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.540]   He picks up his staff, he picks up his shepherd's pouch.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:39.060]   Now, he did not wear those when he was an armor bearer.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.620]   So this is David not taking off the tunic
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.820]   and picking up some other armor.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.820]   It's not him trying to still be like a battle-worn warrior.
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.660]   This is him saying,
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.260]   "I need to be who God has called me to be.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.620]   "I need to embrace the very thing
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.060]   "that God has put into my life.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.140]   "I need to go back to receiving the identity
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:58.540]   "that Christ has given me.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.180]   "If I can't live out of my true identity,
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.700]   "then I cannot fight this battle.
[00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.900]   "So I'm gonna remove the identities and the pressures
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.140]   "and the expectations and the choices
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.740]   "that everybody else has placed on me,
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.860]   "and I'm gonna lay them down,
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.380]   "and I'm gonna pick up the only thing that I can wear,
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.300]   "and that is the righteousness of Christ,
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.980]   "how Christ has called me to be."
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.660]   And he picks up the shepherd's clothes again,
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.980]   and he goes into battle.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.340]   And there's this beautiful thought here
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.500]   that our call is not to nakedness.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.620]   The world does that for us.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.620]   This is fascinating to me.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.420]   The world has a movement right now
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.340]   that comes to define what true freedom is.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.460]   It says true freedom is basically getting rid
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.740]   of all expectations in your life.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.180]   True freedom is getting rid of all responsibilities,
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.180]   all expectations, all responsibilities.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.020]   Release the shackles of everybody else's expectations.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.660]   Release the shackles of responsibility.
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.100]   Just strip it all away,
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.500]   and if you can just be your own boss,
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.860]   if you can rule your own life,
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.180]   if you can just get rid of every responsibility,
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.020]   every expectation, every person's choice,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.460]   and just be you, that's freedom.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.180]   The Bible does not describe freedom that way.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.980]   The biblical invitation is not to nakedness
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.340]   and the stripping away of all shackles of responsibility.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.140]   It's actually about taking up more responsibility
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.420]   than we've ever had.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.540]   But it's not a yoke that is heavy
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.500]   and a burden that weighs us down.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.180]   It is, as Jesus described,
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.580]   "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.980]   "and I will give you rest.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.220]   "I will place my yoke on you, and my yoke is light.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.980]   "My burden is easy."
[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.100]   And he places it on us.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.100]   In other words, there's a responsibility we have
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.780]   to die to ourselves, pick up our cross,
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.780]   and follow after Jesus.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:46.220]   The biblical call is not to nothing.
[00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.300]   It is not to be naked.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.940]   The Bible does not call you to a responsibility-free life.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.540]   Come on, church.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.580]   The Bible doesn't call you just to do whatever you want,
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.140]   just to wear whatever you want,
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.180]   just to kind of work it out,
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:01.580]   just to derobe yourself from everything.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.260]   No, the Bible does call you to recognize
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.340]   that you're wearing the wrong clothes,
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.340]   to recognize how you've been a part of that
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.380]   and how others have placed that upon you.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.580]   It does call you to take off the old.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.540]   Basically says anyone who is in Christ Jesus
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.580]   is a new creation.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.860]   The old is gone, the new has come.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.540]   You cannot put new wine into old wine skins.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.060]   There's this challenge to remove the old,
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.580]   but then there's an invitation
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.540]   not to just stand around naked,
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.420]   but actually to be dressed in the clothes
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.620]   that Christ has paid the price for you for.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.140]   I love this in Genesis 3.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.700]   There's this beautiful moment, right?
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.140]   In Genesis 3, here's Adam and Eve.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.860]   And they're naked and they're unashamed
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.300]   because sin hasn't yet come into the world.
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.780]   So in that time, humanity naked was a good thing.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.180]   But then sin comes in through their own disobedient choice
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.660]   and they realize suddenly that they're naked.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.260]   And the Bible tells us that the first thing they do
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.980]   is they're ashamed of their nakedness.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.180]   And so they decide, okay, I need to cover myself.
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.500]   I need to make myself more presentable to God.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.980]   I'm going to try my best to put clothes on
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.340]   that I think will earn my kind of relationship back with God.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.340]   And so Adam and Eve, they clothe themselves
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.260]   with little fig leaves to cover up
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.780]   some of the parts of their bodies
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.820]   so that they could be more presentable to God.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.660]   And God shows up.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.620]   And first of all, because of the whole sin thing,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.540]   there's a judgment that comes from him on Adam and Eve.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.260]   But at the end of Genesis 3, he does this beautiful thing.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.580]   He says, you tried to clothe yourself,
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.620]   that's never going to work.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:36.660]   And he takes animal skins and he fashions garments for them.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.100]   And he puts clothes on them.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.700]   And out of those clothes, Adam and Eve
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.340]   have a restored dignity and grace before the Lord again.
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.380]   See, the Bible does not call you to nakedness
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.460]   and tells you that's freedom.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.420]   The Bible doesn't call you to realize that you're naked
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.140]   and then challenge you to clothe yourself.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.380]   As much as you shouldn't wear somebody else's clothes,
[00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:04.180]   you also shouldn't try to clothe yourself.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.460]   You following this, church?
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.220]   As much as you shouldn't wear other people's clothes,
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.620]   you shouldn't try to clothe yourself.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.660]   You're never going to put on an armor or a battle armor
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:14.380]   that's going to justify you before God.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.380]   There is no amount of good works
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.700]   that is going to justify you before God.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.900]   The only way that takes place
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.700]   is through the righteousness of the blood of Christ
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.100]   that was poured out in his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.180]   In our recognition of the sin in our lives,
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.820]   the repentance of that sin, and the receiving of his grace.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.820]   Then we get clothed like God closes in grace Adam and Eve.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.060]   Then he comes and clothes our nakedness,
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.340]   our shame with his glory.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.420]   We begin to wear the righteousness of Christ
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.620]   and we are transformed.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.500]   Take a look at all of these verses coming up behind me now.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:52.220]   This is the flow of scripture in this idea.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.740]   Isaiah 64, eight starts with,
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.860]   "All of us have become like one who is unclean.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.940]   "All our righteous acts are like filthy rags."
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.020]   We can't wear clothes that are going to justify us
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.100]   back in a relationship with God.
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.780]   Then Isaiah 61, 10, "I delight greatly in the Lord,
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.500]   "for my soul rejoices in my God,
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.700]   "for he has clothed me with garments of salvation
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.100]   "and arrayed me in robes of his righteousness."
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.780]   I'm going to, I love 24, 49,
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.060]   "I'm going to send you what my father has promised,
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.740]   "but stay in the city until you've been clothed
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.220]   "with power on high."
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.980]   Galatians 3, 27, "For all of you who have been baptized
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.940]   "into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ."
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.900]   Even in 2 Corinthians, "Meanwhile, we groan,
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.700]   "longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling,
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.860]   "because when we are clothed, we are not found naked."
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:36.940]   Amen.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.900]   The call is not to nakedness.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.100]   The call is to a responsibility,
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.060]   to live in the way that Christ has called you to live,
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.460]   through his mercy and his grace,
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.180]   his forgiveness placed on you.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:50.100]   You are to remove the expectations and choices
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.340]   and decisions that have falsely been placed on you,
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.600]   either by others, whether with good intention or bad,
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.740]   or by yourself on your shoulders.
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.060]   You are to remove those things, not be naked,
[00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.620]   but then in your nakedness, come to the Lord and say,
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.100]   "Would you clothe me in righteousness,
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.840]   "that I believe that your blood clothes me
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.940]   "in righteousness."
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.180]   So I want you to see the process as we close,
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.180]   what David does here.
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.500]   He does three things.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.340]   He realizes he's wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.380]   He removes the clothes,
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:21.700]   and then he receives the right garments,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.500]   the ones that he had been given at the very beginning
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.320]   to wear, his true identity, as God has called him,
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.160]   to be a shepherd.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.500]   And he would go on to be a shepherd king.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.860]   He would go on to lead his people much through the wisdom
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.860]   that he gained when he was in that time of being a shepherd.
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.060]   And so for you, some of you here are living
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.640]   somebody else's story.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.180]   Whenever you do that, here's what happens.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.520]   You become a poor imitation of somebody else's life.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.900]   Some of us here have been weighed down way too much
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.700]   with good intended responsibility,
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.760]   expectation from others, and we've carried it around
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.020]   and decided that's the life we're going to live.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.780]   And Christ says, "I've got a story for you to write,
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.880]   "but in order for you to write it,
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.580]   "you've got to be dressed in your clothes."
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.540]   Or you're in the right battle,
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.020]   but you're wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.920]   You need to come and receive what it is
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:18.460]   that I've custom made, tailor made for you.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.660]   And in these clothes, you will find true life.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:25.860]   You'll be able to realize that you're not always wearing
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.060]   what it is that you should wear,
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.420]   and you'll take ownership in removing those things.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:34.020]   And in removing them, you take action before the Lord,
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:39.020]   and you take what is rightfully his onto yourself.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.060]   And in receiving, you take responsibility then
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.260]   to live the life that Christ has called you to live.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:47.800]   That three-part process is what I believe
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.700]   sets David up for success before Goliath.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.620]   And sure, he was good with that sling,
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.540]   and he was smart with how he did it,
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.820]   but the decision he made to remove Saul's clothes
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.940]   was the reason why on the battlefield
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.860]   he could truly be used by God.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.020]   It'll be the same for you.
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.280]   And for you here today, some of you don't wanna leave
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.100]   this place until you've done some of that processing work
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.640]   with the Lord, realizing what it is
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.940]   that you might be wearing.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.000]   For some of us here in this room,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.820]   it's come from our parents.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.340]   And our parents are amazing people,
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.020]   and just like Saul, all the best intentions.
[00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.000]   They wanted the best for you.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.700]   They wanted you to live the best life,
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:29.800]   and yet they've placed expectations on you
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.580]   that have been a weight and a burden.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:35.840]   I believe the Holy Spirit can release that from you today.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.460]   Some of us here as parents, perhaps this is real for us.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.540]   We recognize that we've placed some of that weight
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.260]   on others, and maybe the invitation for the work
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.140]   of the Holy Spirit today for us is just to come
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.620]   and ask him to free us of that guilt,
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:51.660]   or free us of that shame that we might be carrying
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.500]   that makes us feel like maybe I've done that to others.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.140]   Just ask him to forgive us and make us new.
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.180]   Some of you in this room, you've chosen to put stuff on
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.020]   because you've wanted to be like everybody else.
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.220]   You haven't wanted to be alone.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.300]   You've wanted to fit in.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.480]   You wanted to be accepted, and so you've chosen
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.460]   to place on your shoulders how you think other people
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.940]   want you to act so that you would be accepted,
[00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:16.700]   loved, and fitted in to those around you.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.960]   And perhaps today, it's the bravery that David had
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.280]   to say, "I cannot go in these,"
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.240]   and then pick up the true righteousness of Christ
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.340]   that has been provided for you so that you can put on
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.360]   the very thing that was tailor-made, custom-made,
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.840]   so it would fit perfectly on your body,
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.580]   and you would feel like this was the way
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.680]   I was designed to be.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.540]   That's the story for you to write in the year ahead.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.520]   Can I pray for you?
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.360]   Let's pray.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.860]   Father, I thank you for everybody here.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:51.340]   Lord, I thank you for the work you're doing
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.480]   in your spirit and by your presence.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.640]   And Holy Spirit, as we come now to the most important part
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.640]   of the service, we bring you our clothes.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.140]   And I want you just to take a moment,
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:11.140]   and if this message has been speaking to you,
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.220]   this is the time where the Holy Spirit wants to begin
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:17.640]   to speak and do and change and renew for you.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.940]   Perhaps for some of us here today,
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.980]   we recognize that we have been wearing those oversized
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.740]   jackets of other people's expectations,
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.580]   other people's burdens.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.260]   We try to be like others too much.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.060]   Perhaps we've done it from a good place of a good heart,
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:36.080]   or perhaps we've done it because we wanted to fit in
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.740]   or be accepted.
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:40.880]   However it might be, we know that we're trying
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.840]   to be more like someone else than the person
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.920]   Christ has called us to be.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.680]   And because of that, you're living right now
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.740]   somebody else's story and not your own.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:53.440]   So whilst our eyes are closed, I wanna just pray
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.840]   if you would like the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.440]   to help you to realize the clothes that you're wearing,
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.920]   to give you the courage to remove them,
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.900]   and then put you in a place to receive once again
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.000]   the forgiveness and the mercy and the righteousness
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.320]   of Christ for you.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.440]   Maybe just as our eyes are closed,
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:12.800]   you just open your hands where you are.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.900]   And I just wanna pray for you each,
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.680]   whether you're in the overflow, watching online,
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.280]   whether you're in this room, as your hands are open,
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.760]   you're saying, "Lord, I realize that there are just
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.960]   "too many clothes on me."
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.640]   Some of you in this room, I wanna repeat it,
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.100]   are wearing too clothes.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.520]   You're trying to embrace the values of the world
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:37.500]   on the one hand, and then the values of Christ on the other.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.480]   You cannot live that way.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.160]   And if that is you, then this is a time
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.300]   of repentance for you.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.480]   The Bible says His kindness leads us to that place
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.760]   of repentance, and maybe it's just an encouragement
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.200]   to ask the Lord to just be at work in your heart
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.420]   and to say, "Lord, I wanna ask for your forgiveness.
[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.840]   "I don't wanna wear two jackets anymore.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.320]   "I'm tired of it.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.400]   "But Lord, I'm gonna need strength,
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.000]   "'cause it's not easy when I'm in that workplace.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.560]   "It's not easy when I'm out having drinks with my friends.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.660]   "It's not easy when that's happening.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.300]   "And it's so easy for me to slip back into the old jacket.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.780]   "Lord, would you give me strength and courage
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.860]   "to stand apart, to be holy, to pick up that cross,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.360]   "to wear it daily?
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.160]   "Lord, would you help me?
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.280]   "'Cause I know that in my own strength,
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.240]   "I'll just fail again."
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.480]   Some of you just need to ask Jesus to help.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   (gentle music)
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   And maybe for some of you, it's just this joy of knowing
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.560]   that you are to write a new story this year,
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.280]   and that you are to move forward
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.440]   in the righteousness of Christ, as he's called you to do.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.120]   So Holy Spirit, for whatever reason,
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.120]   for those whose hands are open now, come, Lord Jesus, come.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:52.180]   Just receive from him.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.120]   He loves you so much.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.200]   There's so much joy in his heart for you right now,
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.040]   'cause he's looking on you and he's seeing the future
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.480]   and he's seeing the potential, and he's like,
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.920]   "Oh man, this is gonna be amazing."
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.220]   He's like looking at you and saying,
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.640]   "Man, there's a David who's gonna be running
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.340]   "towards their Goliaths this year,
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.360]   "in the right battle, wearing the right clothes."
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.060]   So come, Lord Jesus, come.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:23.520]   Just come, Lord Jesus.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.280]   Thank you for your goodness to us.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.480]   Thank you for your love.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:35.240]   Just take some time to receive from him.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.660]   (soft music)
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.080]   (soft music)
