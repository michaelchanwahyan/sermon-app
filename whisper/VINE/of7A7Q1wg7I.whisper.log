[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Have a seat, have a seat. We're in our final week of Exodus. This has been a 30
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.200]   week series. If you are new to the Vine, this is your first week with us. You've
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.060]   come right at the end, well done. You're here, we're glad you're here. The majority
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.080]   of us, I'm sure, we've been journeying, whether you've been here for the whole
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.040]   30 weeks or maybe you've been here for some of the weeks of this series, but
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.000]   we've been journeying together and what it is for a God to look down on a people
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   who are scattered and enslaved and oppressed and have compassion for them
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.560]   and want them to go out of a place of slavery into a place of freedom. Not, as
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.040]   I've said, just for freedom's sake, but freedom to be able to then be planted in
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.200]   the land of God's promises and His blessings. And as we come to the end of
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.160]   our series today, we come to this moment where Israel steps into, prepares
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.800]   themselves to step into the promises and the blessings that God has and I've
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.960]   just so enjoyed this journey with you. But before we get into what I want to
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.280]   share with you in this final week, I want to pause just for a moment to honor and
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.280]   recognize some incredible people that have worked so hard to pull off a series
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.080]   like this. This is the third film series that we've done here at the Vine and
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.400]   this one was by far the most complex, the most crazy, the most delayed. One of the
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.880]   series that we thought at one point would never even happen. It's taken us
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.160]   about five years from conception to completion of the series. We shot this
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.480]   series in two Middle Eastern countries over the process of about 40 production
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.800]   days over a one-year period during a global pandemic. It was crazy and you can
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.680]   imagine that although I'm perhaps the one that you see regularly up here
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.920]   communicating this series, the series has really only been possible because of the
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.640]   dedication of so many men and women that you haven't seen regularly but have been
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.040]   working so hard behind the scenes to make this happen. So I want to honor just
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.200]   some of them here today. This is just a kind of a collage of a bunch of our
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   production team and our filmmakers that journeyed with us to Egypt and to Jordan.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.560]   This person right here in the middle of this photo is Riley Sue. Riley was the
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.240]   producer on this series. She's actually been the producer that's worked with me
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.160]   over the last three film series that we've done. Riley is an incredible person
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.880]   and you can imagine what it would have been like over a five-year period to do
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.920]   something like this where you have to get visas and permits and you have to
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.080]   hire production companies and get permits and security clearances to film
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.000]   in some of the most hostile places in the Middle East and be able to do that
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.160]   over a global pandemic with all the delays, all the frustrations. Riley is
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.040]   incredible. Can we honor Riley just a bit? She lives here in Hong Kong
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.880]   but right now she's visiting her husband who's based in California. So thank you
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.480]   Riley for all your incredible hard work. This guy right here is Toby Thomas. He
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.680]   was the director of the whole series, the film director. Toby, a good friend of mine,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.520]   he's actually also, as well as a filmmaker, he's an Anglican priest based
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.280]   in London. So five years ago in 2018 I called him up and I said, "Hey, I've got
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.720]   this crazy idea to do this crazy series." He was in it from day one and we spent
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.640]   the first three months just on Zoom together reading the book of Exodus
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.000]   together and plotting and scheming and dreaming and praying. A lot of the
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.440]   content that we've delivered in this series has come out of those times. His
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.840]   creativity throughout this whole series has been fantastic. This guy here is
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.880]   Oliver James. Oliver was our director of photography on the shoot in both Jordan
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.760]   and in Egypt. Oliver was the guy that was behind the camera when I was in front of
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.040]   it doing whatever I needed to do. He was an incredible person. Right here at the
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.560]   back is actually Anthony Gibbs. Anthony was the second camera operator, the
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.320]   director of photography for our B-roll. B-roll is basically like all the rocks
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.040]   and beautiful vistas and pyramids and all the stuff that I'm not in, all the
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.640]   beautiful shots. Those were the shots that Anthony did. All the shots that I
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.840]   were in were the shots that I did with Oliver and all the other shots
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.400]   were Anthony. So if you loved any of the vistas or those close slow-mo shots of
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.000]   ancient rocks, that was that man right there at the back. But he was also the
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.720]   editor of the whole series. He edited, there was in total about 35 films in
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.800]   total across this series. He edited every single one of them. I spoke to him this
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.440]   week. He said, "I am so sick of hearing your voice." And I understand that.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:38.200]   This guy down here, this is Devin. Devin was on our shoot in Egypt. He was
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.360]   supposed to be on our shoot in Egypt for the whole time, but his wife was pregnant
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.080]   and she was gonna give birth about seven weeks after we were finished the filming.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.400]   So we figured and Devin figured that everything would be fine. About six days
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.680]   into the shoot in Egypt, his wife's waters broke and he had to jump
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.440]   on a plane and emergency fly back. They delivered a very healthy child, which is
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.280]   fantastic. But he was with us for about six days. So as he was stepping off,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.480]   we were like, "We need someone to step in." And Riley was also supposed to come with
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.800]   us on the shoot, but she fell pregnant in all the delays that happened. And so we
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.760]   invited this incredible guy right here. This is Benjamin Chase on our production
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.040]   staff here at The Vine. And he stepped in and literally at the last minute learned
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.600]   how to do all the sound stuff that we needed on the ground. And he's standing
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.800]   right here looking at me. Can we give him a lot of love? Yes. I love it. I love it. I
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.360]   love it. And as well as everybody who was involved in all the filming side of
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.400]   the project, there was an incredible team behind the scenes here at The Vine who
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.040]   was working on taking once the films were produced and made, turning those
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.080]   films into the reality of what you've seen. And so I really want to honor
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.000]   Promise Armstrong and his whole creative team and all the work that they've done
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.800]   over this time. Every single person in his team has put a lot of hours into
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.240]   this series. I particularly want to highlight Balana Soriano. She's the lady
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   that's done all of the graphic design work for this series, whether that's the
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.160]   posters that you've seen throughout the series, whether it's the logo that was
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.840]   designed, the devotional books that you got, all of that was designed and made by
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.480]   Balana. So I really want to honor her. Onshun was somebody in our team who did
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.520]   all the translation work. Zoe Chan did the translation itself. She did a
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.680]   phenomenal job. And then Onshun took that translation and put it into the films
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.200]   so that we have English and Chinese there for every film. That was amazing.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.680]   And then finally, I really want to honor Chris Webster, one of our congregation
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.640]   members, who spent about a year and a half writing all those devotions that
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.920]   you've been reading, and those devotions have been phenomenal. So for all of those
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.760]   people, can we put our hands together and just honor them?
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.120]   And one of the things that, you know, as the leaders here and pastors here,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.400]   often we get some of the feedback around the series and what God has done, but so
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.960]   often we don't hear of all the spiritual work that happens through a series like
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.120]   Exodus. And I know that so much has happened spiritually in your individual
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.680]   lives over this series. And so what I thought, different from what we've done
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.720]   in other series, I would love to actually hear from you about what God might have
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.640]   done in your life over this series. And then I'm going to collate together a lot
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.360]   of that, and then we'll be able to feedback some of that to us as a church
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.400]   at a later date. So if God has spoken to you in this series, if there's been a
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.080]   significant breakthrough for you or something spiritually that God has done,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.760]   I want to invite you to email me this week. This is my email. You could just
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.840]   shoot me an email and say, "Hey, here's what God has done in my life. I just want
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.760]   to, you know, testify really about what God has done through this series." And then
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.520]   we'll bring some of that testimony. You know, Ephesians speaks about that
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.880]   actually the church is built up when the glory of Christ is made known within the
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   church. And I think this will be one of the ways that we can make known the
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.840]   glory of what God has done amongst us over these 30 weeks. Does that sound
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.080]   all right? All right. Enough of all of that. We'll put that now to one side.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.840]   And here, as we enter into our final week of Exodus, we actually enter into a
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.520]   concluding moment in the story that sets up everything that is about to happen next.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.320]   Because the reality is, at the end of the Exodus, although it's the end of the
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   Exodus narrative, it's actually the beginning of a whole new story.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.280]   It's the beginning of Israel moving into the promised land and establishing for
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.480]   themselves a nation within that land and establishing eventually the city of
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.680]   Jerusalem, eventually the temple that's built there. There are so many years of
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.160]   flourishing and growth in the promises and the blessings that are ahead.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.800]   But as we come to the ending point of this series, we have to now prepare
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.720]   ourselves for the beginning point of something new. That was the call on Israel.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.440]   Right at the end of this story, the call that God brings them is,
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.840]   "Are you prepared? Are you ready now to step into the land of blessings?"
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:02.280]   They came to a decision point. And it might sound funny that there's this
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.800]   decision point about whether they're going to enter the promised land or not,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.000]   because surely they're going to want to enter the promised land.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.120]   I mean, this has been something that's been like a carrot on the end of a stick
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.840]   for them for over 40-something years by this point. And they've longed to be in
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.600]   that place. So you would think that this isn't much of a decision,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.240]   but God knew that there was one more thing that they needed to transition
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.960]   within themselves to enable them to now walk into the land of blessing.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.120]   Because remember, up until this point in their kind of existence as a nation,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.680]   all they've known for so many years is slavery, then God's liberation,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.400]   but then a journey without a home. They've been homeless in the wilderness.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.480]   But now they're about to move into a new season where they'll have a home,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:54.960]   and they need to flourish, and grow, and put roots down, and take their place
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.080]   in the land of promise. And God understood that for that transition
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:06.880]   to happen, another transition needed to take place. And it's the same also for you.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.520]   If you've been a part of this journey at all through our Exodus time,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.920]   you're now also now at a transition moment. Will you step into all of the blessings
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.560]   and promises that God has for you? Or will you decide to remain at the distance,
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.880]   perhaps free from some of that slavery in the past, but not yet walking in to the
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:35.960]   promises that God really has for you? This challenge is really a challenge,
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.560]   not just for the end of this series, but one we've seen almost every step
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.040]   of the series on its way. The challenge is essentially this,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.640]   will we move forward in the new despite its uncertainties, or will we remain
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:59.520]   in the old despite its deficiencies? That's the challenge that Moses finds
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:06.400]   himself at as we come to the conclusion of the story. And the fascinating thing is,
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.680]   Moses doesn't actually have to answer this question for himself because Moses is
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.640]   told by God that he will not enter the land of promise and blessing.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   In fact, Moses learns as they get ready to transition in that he is not going to be
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.880]   the one that would lead his people into that place of great blessing and purpose.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.800]   And I wonder if you could imagine how that must have felt for Moses.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.560]   And Moses realizing that he's going to have to hand over his whole leadership
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.560]   of Israel, having worked so hard to get Israel to this point,
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.800]   he now needs to hand over the leadership of Israel to one of his mentees of the next
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:51.200]   generation, a man called Joshua. And this whole process of him being willing
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.160]   and prepared and able to hand over is really what the book of Deuteronomy
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.640]   is all about. If you were here a couple of weeks ago,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.840]   you'll remember that I said then that the Exodus story doesn't finish in the book
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.480]   of Exodus. When the book of Exodus comes to an end, there's two other books that
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.240]   carry on the story, the book of Numbers and the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.360]   Numbers picks up from where the book of Exodus leaves off.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.720]   As Israel is departing Mount Sinai, it's picked up in Numbers and they come
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.880]   to Kadesh Barnea. And it's where in Numbers that they send
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.000]   out the spies into the promised land. The spies come back with the report they
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   have. Fear fills the nation of Israel and they decide not to move forward.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.760]   And because of that, God says, "You're going to have to wander now
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.120]   for 40 years in the wilderness, one year for every kind of day that they were
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.840]   in the promised land, spying it out because they didn't have the faith to move
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.520]   forward into the promise." That's the book of Numbers.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.520]   The book of Deuteronomy picks up right where Numbers finishes off.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.760]   The 40 years of the wandering in the wilderness is now complete and now Israel
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.480]   is about to move forward towards their first steps in the promised land.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:03.240]   Let me read this to you right at the start of Deuteronomy 1, verses 1 to 3.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.760]   These are the words that Moses spoke to all of Israel in the desert east of the
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.080]   Jordan, that is, in the Arabah, opposite Suf, between Paran and Tufel,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.040]   Laban, Heresof, and Dischbab. It takes 11 days to go from Horeb to
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.760]   Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir Road. In the 40th year, on the first day of the
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.720]   11th month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the Lord had
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.080]   commanded him concerning them. Right here in this moment,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:39.160]   Israel is moving. They're moving from Kadesh Barnea now up to a new place where
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.040]   Moses is going to draw them together and speak some final commands to them before
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.400]   they enter into the promised land. And so let me just remind you of the geography
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.120]   of this moment one last time with us. Last time that we did the series,
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.080]   two weeks ago, we looked at Kadesh Barnea and the wilderness.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   This is where they wandered for 40 years. But now they come on this 11-day journey,
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.280]   and they come all the way up here to roughly what is this area here,
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:11.360]   which is the area of the modern city of Amman in Jordan today.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:16.720]   But in those days, it was known as Moab. Arabah was all up in this area.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.480]   And this is a mountain called Mount Nebo. That mountain is still there today.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.040]   It's still called Mount Nebo. You can go to Amman in Jordan,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   and you can visit that mountain. It is this mountain that Moses comes
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.640]   to with Israel, and they stay at that mountain. And God calls Moses to go
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.600]   up that mountain so he can see for the very first time the promised land
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.800]   for himself, which you can imagine was an exciting moment for Moses.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.360]   But as he's looking out, he understands that he's not the person
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.480]   that's going to carry Israel into that land. In fact, I want to read this to you.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   I want to read this to you from Deuteronomy 34, starting in verse 1.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.320]   It says this, "Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.680]   to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the Lord showed him the whole land,
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.960]   from Gilead to Dan, all of Nathalie, and the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.360]   all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea, the Negev and the whole region
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.400]   from the valley of Jericho, the city of Palms, as far as Zohar.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.480]   Then the Lord said to him, 'This is the land that I promised on oath to Abraham
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.040]   and Isaac and Jacob when I said, "I will give it to your descendants.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.680]   I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it."
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.360]   And Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in Moab, as the Lord had said.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.560]   He buried him in Moab in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day,
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   no one knows exactly where the grave is. Moses was 120 years old when he died,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.800]   yet his eyes were not weak, nor his strength gone."
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.000]   Hands up if you'd like that to happen to you. Come on, come on.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.400]   "The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab 30 days,
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.360]   until the time of weeping and mourning was over.
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.240]   Now Joshua, son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom,
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.360]   because Moses had laid his hands on him.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.560]   So the Israelites listened to him and did what the Lord had commanded Moses."
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.880]   Here's that moment. They're on top of Mount Nebo.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.960]   Moses is looking out on the promised land, and God begins to speak to him
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.880]   and shows him all the land, and he begins to see that it's this land
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.480]   flowing with milk and honey, and God says, "You can see it,
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.960]   but you can't go in it." And Moses understands that he's now called
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.280]   to do one final act. He's going to have to transition his leadership
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.920]   from himself to Joshua. I wonder if you could imagine the humility
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:51.800]   that was needed, having for over 40 years led his people to the very prize that God
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:59.480]   had always said that they would have, and yet he can't grasp the prize.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.120]   Transition in any kind of leadership is perhaps one of the hardest things we
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.440]   as humans have to do. And some of you in this room are in great places
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.360]   of leadership. Every single one of us in this room is a leader.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.840]   We are people that have people around us, that we have an authority over,
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:22.120]   that we have a sphere of influence within. How is it possible for us
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:28.040]   to transition leadership? This is the significant thing that God
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.360]   wants Israel to wrestle with as they step into the promised land.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:36.160]   It's the significant thing I want us to wrestle with as we step out of this
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.760]   series into all that God has for us in the future. To help us with that,
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.640]   for the very last time, I want to take you to the land of Exodus.

[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.000]   This is the mountain that God calls Moses to ascend right in that final chapter
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.160]   of Deuteronomy. So from its summit, he can survey the promised land.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.880]   And I'm sensing that God might be calling me to ascend that mountain

[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:07.440]   So it would have been right here in roughly about 1400 BC that Moses would have stood
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.200]   and for the very first time looked out on the land of Canaan.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.600]   I mean, this had been a 40-year journey to get to this point,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.040]   and finally they're standing here. And you can imagine for Moses what it would
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.520]   have felt like. God had always promised to him that he would be able to see
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.280]   the promised land. And now in this moment, he's able to gaze out at the coming
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.360]   of a promise.

[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:44.320]   Having just been in Egypt myself and having just retraced the journey
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.840]   that the Israelites went on, I can imagine just how incredibly excited Moses
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.240]   would have been standing in this place. I mean, they've just seen incredible
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.600]   miracles take place to get them here. But they've also had to wrestle
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.920]   with the difficulties and the hardships of their identity and their sin.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.440]   And so getting here, seeing the promise, there would have been a sense of praise
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.560]   and worship for Moses. But I think there was also another emotion at play.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.920]   And we get a little hint of it from Deuteronomy 34.4. For there,
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.600]   God reminds Moses that although he can see the promised land,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.560]   he'll never be able to actually enter it. We know actually back in Deuteronomy 3
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   why this is the case. Moses had actually disobeyed God in that moment of the rock
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.200]   and the water. And he had actually not listened to the way in which God had asked
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.440]   him to do that miracle. And even worse than that, later on,
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.360]   Moses actually claims credit for the miracle himself. And because of all
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:41.440]   of this, God's anger burns against Moses, burns against his unfaithfulness,
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.080]   and the way in which his leadership has now pulled down what God was wanting to do
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.560]   with his people. And because of that, Moses would end up dying on this mountain.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.040]   And instead, it would be Joshua that would lead his people into the promised land.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:10.800]   So this mountain represents for Moses both exuberant joy and sober reflection.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.960]   I mean, he's right here at the end of his life. And I think he would have sat
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.240]   on the mountain and reflected back on all that has happened for him.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:21.600]   I mean, he's seen God face to face, seen some of the most incredible miracles
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.360]   that we have recorded for us in the Scriptures. And he's even had the word
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:30.200]   of God in such profound ways that it's shaped all of history ever since.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.560]   But Moses along the way has also encountered the frailty of the human heart.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.760]   He's seen the power of sin and what that can do to people,
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.080]   both the Israelites themselves and also himself personally. And I think all
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.000]   of that would have been in his heart and mind as he sat here on this mountain
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.920]   on that day. And he knew that there was one final act that he had to do,
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.160]   and that was to pass leadership from himself to Joshua, the one who would take
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.360]   the Israelites into the promised land. And to help us to think a little bit more
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.040]   about what that transition would have been like, I want to take you
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.160]   to another mountain. It's actually a mountain that means a lot to me.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.640]   It's in my city of Hong Kong. And I want to introduce you to one
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.960]   of my spiritual fathers and talk to you a little bit more about the profundity
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.200]   and power of transition in leadership.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:31.560]   Tony, what a privilege it is to stand here on this mountain to look out over our city
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.840]   of Hong Kong that we love so deeply. And I think both of us have lived here.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.040]   I've probably lived here over 30, maybe over 40 or so years for you now.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.720]   - Yeah, been there. - In this city.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.920]   And to talk about transition, leadership transition, and I'm so blessed that
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.120]   yourself and John Snellgrove, the former senior pastors at the Vine Church,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.640]   handed the church over to me at a relatively young age, at a time when you guys were
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.880]   at the height of your ministry, you handed the church over, you transitioned it.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.240]   And I don't think a lot of churches do that. So I wanted to just ask,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.640]   why did you guys believe so much in leadership transition?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.920]   Yeah, I think to understand that, you have to understand a little bit of about the church
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.760]   and what its constitution was. And we had a lot of young people in the church.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.240]   And it wasn't just that they were attached as part of the church.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.000]   They were the powerhouse of the church. They were the energy.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.720]   They were the passion that tended to provide the energy for who we were as a church
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:35.400]   and almost give us that next generation idea of where we felt the church was going to go.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.560]   And clearly, you know, God speaks about taking the church through generations
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.600]   and his promises from one generation to another.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.360]   Right.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:50.120]   And so it was clear to us that, you know, neither John and I were really next generation people.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:57.840]   Here we were somewhat late in our age, having the incredible privilege of running a church
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:05.480]   and yet seeing that God's vision and God's projection was so much further than maybe where we could take it.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.240]   Right, right.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:16.280]   And so this idea of wanting to transition to a leader who was part of that generation was born in our minds.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.440]   It's a big thing to let go, you know, and I think one of the things I really honor and admire in you and John
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.760]   is just your ability to have done that, to be able to let go of something that you had birthed.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.040]   I mean, if you think of the church like a child, you'd birthed the child, you'd raised the child.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.480]   The child had grown up and now you were sort of handing that child on.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.080]   That's a lot of letting go.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.960]   And I think of Moses, you know, as he's standing there on Mount Nebo, right?
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.640]   And he's thinking about looking out on the promised land that he's never going to enter.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.440]   He's having to let go of his own dream of walking into that promised land.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.760]   What was that letting go like for you?
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:59.960]   In some ways, that letting go was, it wasn't particularly painful, but in that process of letting go,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.240]   there's a little bit, you know, whatever we talk and say about leadership,
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.640]   there's a little bit of our identity in leadership.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:14.000]   And so you begin to lose that sense of, yeah, I'm the pastor of the church.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.480]   And you have to then start looking for other ways to serve the church, other ways to be involved.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.800]   Because unlike many processes, of course, we did not disappear off the scene.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   We were still around.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.720]   And so there was that...
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.000]   You didn't die on Mount Nebo, like Moses.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.760]   I did not die.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.120]   That's good.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.760]   Not my time yet.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:44.040]   That allowed us, I think, to be able to be present in a way which did not interfere in terms of your decisions
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:54.560]   and the way that you were going, but allowed us to let go and find other ways of providing input and involvement in the church.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.880]   So there was, in a sense, it was not a sharp cutoff,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.240]   but it was a gradual way of finding other ways in which we could be involved.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.560]   And I think, you know, all due respect,
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.000]   encouraged to you to be able to take on a church while the two former senior pastors are still hanging around.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.680]   I think about, again, Moses on the top of Mount Nebo, right?
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.840]   He's looking out on the promised land.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.240]   He's going through all this stuff in his head around the mistakes he had made.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:29.880]   And actually, part of the reason why he wasn't entering into the promised land was the Lord's punishment to those mistakes that he had made.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.400]   What mistakes do you feel like when you look back on the process that you didn't quite get right?
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.280]   And how does that make you feel now?
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.680]   I think we probably assumed too much.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:54.480]   And when I look back on the process, there was a sense in which probably at your young age, you know, you could argue maybe we dropped you in it too soon.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:06.240]   But there was a sense. And so I think, you know, that there has been that sort of struggle of leadership and things that you've had to dealt with that maybe we could have thought about a little more carefully.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.960]   But for us, I think we had to be reminded of the fact that we needed to let go.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:19.160]   And for me, I believe that was the best decision that we ever made in terms of our leadership in the church.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.440]   And I think it's been the most fruitful decision that's been made in the church.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:32.480]   So one thing I wanted to ask you was also about the process of transition, because I mean, there's the decision, which we've touched on already and how God was involved in that decision.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.000]   But then there's the process. There's the actual walking out in obedience, the thing that God's called you.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.640]   What was the process like for John and yourself?
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:48.320]   Well, I think, you know, you have to understand that transition is, everyone thinks about it just as change.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.720]   But transition is both change and continuity.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:28:01.800]   And so if you want to look at it in sort of broad terms, you could say that Moses' job was to get Israel up to the River Jordan.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.480]   Yeah. And then Joshua's job was to take them through that and into the promised land.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.920]   Yeah. And so there is that continuity is the people.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.880]   It's the church. Right.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.480]   And this is, I think, the reflection of God's heart is for his people.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.800]   And the fact as leaders, it's in a sense, it's not about us.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.680]   It's about the people of God and it's about that continuity.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.840]   And of course, you see that, you know, going right through scripture.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:37.920]   Yeah. So that gives you not just an abrupt change, but a certain process that leads you through.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.760]   And each part needs to understand what their part in the leadership process is.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.120]   Yeah. And that's not always easy.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.640]   No, not at all.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:51.920]   Final question really would be around just your reflections on Moses, you know, that that moment of him on the on the top of Mount Nebo.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.120]   You know what? Given that you've been through the process yourself, obviously in a very different way,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.240]   but you know, you've had to hand on something that you've nurtured and cared for for so long.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.600]   What do you think Moses was feeling when he kind of I mean, we're looking out on Hong Kong, which is our our passion.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.840]   But he was looking out on the promised land, his passion.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.720]   Yeah. What were some of the things that you think he was processing in those last moments of his life?
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.640]   You know, you could say he might be processing the what ifs, I shouldn't haves.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:25.720]   Right. But I think that in that process, you know, it says that God took him and, you know,
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:31.760]   there was that sense in which he must have sensed I've achieved what I was asked to do.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.880]   Yeah. And I need to be satisfied with that.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.080]   Yeah. Not just satisfied with it. I have to take joy in that fact.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:46.480]   And I have the sense that he would walk away from that, you know, at his 120 years old and wherever it was that,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:52.640]   you know, God buried him. Yeah. Yeah. With a sense of, yeah, that was good. Yeah. I've done that.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.960]   Well done, my good and faithful servant. Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.440]   As the Joshua in our context, I can say that to you.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.680]   I've said that to you many times, but it's an honour to say that to you again,
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:06.360]   just like the incredible job you did in nurturing me, nurturing our church, handing it over,
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.200]   doing so so open handedly, despite some of the fears and the challenges of that.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.760]   You did an incredible job. And it gives me such a beautiful model for my future as I think about doing that in my context.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.600]   So thanks, Tony, so much. It's my pleasure. And thank you for doing what you're doing.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.280]   You know, I know the burdens of some of that. You know, the burdens of a lot of it.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.960]   Yes. You face those burdens. So thank you for what you're doing.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:43.320]   I appreciate it.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:48.760]   It's hard to describe to you what it's been like to have two people like John and Tony in my life
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.040]   who have been able to nurture not just the vine, but myself as well,
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.880]   to a place of being able to walk into what God has for it.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:05.280]   And the way that they did that so open handedly, so honestly and with so much humility, I think is truly profound.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.640]   And we as a church are very blessed to have former senior pastors like the two of them
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.280]   that have done that in such a beautiful way in our midst.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:19.680]   And I think what you see in Tony there, I think a lot of that is in Moses as he's standing there on Mount Nebo.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.880]   Moses understands that God had called him for a time and a season.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.640]   I love one of the things that Tony says in the film. He says, "We realized we could see the trajectory,
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:35.480]   the projection of where God wanted to take the vine, but we knew that we weren't the ones that could get the church there,
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   and we needed to let it go." And I think Moses on Mount Nebo, he's experiencing that same kind of thing.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:47.160]   I think he understood that he was God's appointed person to lead Israel out of their slavery,
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.640]   out of that oppression, bring them into the wilderness, meet with God at Mount Sinai,
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.280]   receive the law and bring them to literally just steps away from the promised land.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:03.800]   But he also knows he's not God's person. He's not God's anointed person to lead Israel now into the flourishing that's ahead.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:12.840]   Because Moses understood that the whole journey of Exodus was really not just about getting Israel out of a place of slavery and oppression.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:18.480]   It was actually also about getting them in now into a place of blessing and promise and abundance.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:25.200]   It was those two things. And Moses had the great joy of seeing them come through that first stage.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.440]   And now Joshua is going to have the great joy of taking them on.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.880]   And I wonder if you could imagine the humility that needs to sit in Tony and John's heart
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.000]   to hand over a church when they were still relatively young and had a lot of energy in them.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.840]   And how that humility must have been on Moses as he now understands that in order for the people of God
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:52.080]   to get the greatest of what it is that God has for them in the future, he has to let go.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:33:01.160]   And it is this act of letting go that I want to finish our time on today speaking to you about.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:09.520]   Because in the very same way that Israel were called and destined to step into the promised land,
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:16.520]   but they had to have this letting go of one leadership and the taking up of another leadership.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:23.600]   So it is also true for us that as we move from one place to the next,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:29.160]   as we think about what it is for us to move into a land where we can flourish and grow
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:34.040]   and the promises of God can be with us, we also have to recognize that there needs to be, if you will,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.560]   a leadership transition that happens within us.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:43.160]   A transition that happens within us when we think about the person that we have been in the past
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.320]   and the person that we now are today.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:52.160]   And to realize that the person that we were before that did all of those things that got us to where we are today
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.800]   is perhaps not the person that's going to be able to sustain us in the future that we have.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:04.640]   We need to transition all the time within ourselves towards the person that God is calling us to be today.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.640]   Are you with me on this?
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:15.720]   It's almost as if, if you will, we need to let our inner Moses die so our inner Joshua can arise.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.640]   Because there is a season of blessing.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:22.480]   I know this in my spirit. Honestly, it's hard for me to communicate this.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:28.320]   I know this in my spirit that 2024 is going to be a year of incredible blessing for the vine.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.800]   If you think about it, this whole year has been about our journey of Exodus.
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.040]   And today we're about to step towards 2024.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.200]   I believe as we step into 2024, it's going to be like our promised land.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.800]   But we have a transition we need to make in order to get in there.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.560]   We need to allow ourselves to realize that the last thing we want in the promised land
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:58.160]   is to be led by the person who brought us there, but is not the person that can enable us to flourish there.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.840]   See, it's interesting.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.240]   There is nothing more counterproductive in the Christian life
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.280]   than living in the land of God's blessings and promise
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.440]   while still being led by the season of slavery in the past.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.680]   There is nothing more counterproductive in the Christian life than that.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:24.280]   To be where God has called us to be, and yet our mindset and our thinking and who we are
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.720]   still being rooted in the season in the past.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.600]   And so God brings Moses up to Mount Nebo.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.240]   He shows him the promised land and he says, "It's not you that's going to lead these people forward.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.440]   It's got to be Joshua.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:41.600]   You need to hand over, let go, transition to the person who can truly help to get you there."
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.480]   And it's the same for us as we come out of our Exodus series
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.200]   and we want to walk into the promise of this incredible city that God has
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.840]   and all the things God wants to do in us.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.880]   We have to go.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.800]   There is a person inside of me that helped me to get where I am today.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.760]   But that person is not the one who can sustain me and flourish me in the season ahead.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:11.080]   I also need to transition my soul, if you will, towards the one who can truly set me free.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.280]   This is the thing, and we have to be really careful with this.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:23.840]   You don't want Moses to lead you where only Joshua can take you.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:30.840]   You don't want Moses to lead you where only Joshua has been anointed to take you.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.000]   This is why Paul, when he writes to the church, he says, "If anybody is in Christ Jesus,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.240]   you have to understand one fundamental thing.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.160]   If you are in Christ Jesus, you are what?
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.720]   A new creation.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.600]   The old is gone, the new has come.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.040]   The person you were before is not the one who should be making decisions now that you're new.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.800]   The person that you were before and the story that you had before,
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.560]   that story of pain and sin and that story of liberation and what God has done,
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.880]   that's a great story.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:03.080]   It's been a part of who you are, but that is not the story that should be now telling you
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:06.000]   how to think, how to act whilst you're in the land of promise.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.960]   You need to let Moses go and you need to take up Joshua.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:18.760]   And it shouldn't surprise us that Joshua, the very name, is a derivative of Jesus.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:27.920]   That Jesus and Joshua essentially is the same name because Jesus becomes our great Joshua,
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.160]   the one who leads us into the promised land of eternal life with him,
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.560]   a promised land of his grace and his mercy and his forgiveness,
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.720]   a promised land where the blessings flow upon us from generation to generation
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.240]   as we sung about before.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:46.800]   It is Jesus that we have to, on a daily basis, transition ourselves to.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.280]   I don't want my inner Moses to lead me where only my inner Joshua can take me.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.440]   I don't want my previous story to be the primary thing that makes me think now,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.440]   "Here, I want the mind of Christ.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.280]   I want Jesus, who is the only one who knows what the land of blessing is truly like.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.480]   I want him to lead me into all that he has for me."
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:15.600]   But it's so easy for us to hold on to who we were before and even to think that,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:20.200]   even in the blessings, it really is me, the broken thing before,
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.920]   rather than I am a son or a daughter or a child of God.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.040]   I am one that God is forming and shaping.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.760]   I am more than a conquering Christ Jesus, that the same spirit that raised Jesus
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.600]   from the dead now sits in me.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.920]   I have a story to take.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.480]   I will take my place.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.080]   Come on, church.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.040]   I will now walk into the land of blessings and promises,
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.080]   not with the mindset of everything that's happened before,
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.000]   but with a mindset that has been renewed by Christ Jesus,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.360]   which is why Paul writes to the church and says,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:56.880]   "If you want to live a life as a living sacrifice, renew your mind,
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:04.520]   because it's now our Joshua, Jesus, that leads us forward."
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.080]   Now, here's why this is all really important.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.800]   This is all really important, because everything that Jesus is doing inside of you internally
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   throughout this whole series has really actually not just been about you.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.480]   It's actually been about us.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.000]   See, what we've seen throughout the whole of the Exodus journey
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.800]   is not just God's work on individual people to change and transform them.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.360]   Obviously, the most notable of that, Moses, but also Aaron and Hur and Jethro.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.000]   Pharaoh himself goes through a transformation, Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.440]   There's Moses' mother.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.960]   There's the midwives that we saw right at the beginning of the series.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.520]   God has come and worked on individuals every single step of the way.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.960]   But with that, there's been a bigger story unfolding.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.320]   And that's been the story of God forming out of individuals
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:55.120]   that are being transformed by him into a worshipping community together.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.800]   That the point of Exodus for God is not just that individuals would experience freedom,
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.200]   but that they would be created a worshipping community
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:10.960]   within which they can be together far more powerful than they would ever be on their own.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.520]   Everything that we've seen at Mount Sinai with the law,
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.920]   everything that we see on Mount Nebo as Moses hands over leadership to Joshua,
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.520]   and as Joshua takes a nation, a powerful nation,
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.200]   that is now going to represent the purposes and promise of God in the world,
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.120]   it's about their individual stories of redemption and liberation
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.440]   now intertwined together to create an even greater story of the church.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.920]   That's what the church is all about.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.640]   We are a combined beautiful story of the grace of God.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.000]   And together we are always much more powerful than we would ever be on our own.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.840]   Yes, God has changed and transformed us personally,
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.720]   but he's drawn us together so that our stories of liberation
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:00.840]   are intertwined with one another to create a much more powerful voice in the world
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.640]   than we could ever, ever imagine.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.200]   Jesus calls it the kingdom of God.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:14.520]   Back on April 16th, the very first week of the Exodus series,
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.480]   we did something symbolically together.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.120]   I wonder if some of you were here on that particular Sunday.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.800]   We had a basket here in the front of the auditorium.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.320]   And on that Sunday I spoke about, as we introduced the idea of Exodus,
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.480]   that Exodus actually means in the Greek a departure.
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.280]   And I challenged you as a church to think about
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.960]   what are you departing from in this moment as the series begins?
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.840]   What is it in terms of your brokenness or your sin
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.400]   or a relationship that you want changed or emotions or habits that you want to break?
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.520]   We all have a point of departure that we want to move out from.
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.040]   That's what Exodus is.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.640]   And so as I challenged you on that very first Sunday
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.720]   to think about your point of departure,
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.840]   there was a little piece of mosaic tile under every single one of your chairs.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.160]   And I told you at the end of the service,
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.560]   get that mosaic tile, that mosaic tile represents for you
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.960]   that thing that you're departing from.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.320]   And as we were worshipping together,
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.760]   you came forward and you placed that little tile in the basket.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.960]   And that was your prophetic act of saying, "I want to change.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.880]   I need to depart.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.920]   There needs to be an Exodus happening inside of me."
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.800]   And it was really a beautiful thing we did individually on that day.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:30.120]   Well, what you don't know is that we took up all of those individual little pieces of tile
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.160]   that you had placed in the basket across our three services,
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:38.200]   and we did something really special with it.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.600]   And we did something special with it because in the act of doing that,
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:48.200]   we were actually communicating what the whole story of Exodus has been about.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.680]   And to help you to see that, I want to show you the very, very final film.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.000]   And in this film, you will see what Exodus really means.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   We took every single piece that you placed in the baskets on that Sunday.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   And a man in Amman, Jordan took every single one of our little bits.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And as you saw in the film, he took them and he cut them and shaped them and formed them.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   And then he placed them individually, one by one, into this beautiful mosaic that he created.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   And I think this speaks to us of what this whole 30 weeks has been about.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   Because this is exactly what God does with Israel.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Because at the start of the story, there are scattered, broken people.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   And God, out of his compassion, gathers them up.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   And he speaks hope into them.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   And he says, "I've seen your suffering and your slavery, and I have a good promise for you."
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   And he picks them up and he takes them to Sinai,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   and he begins to shape them and mold them into the people that he needs them to be.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And he draws them together as a new family and a new community.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And then he releases them into the promised land, filled with the hope of something new.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   And this is us.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Lots of individual broken things that, by the grace of God and by his Spirit and his love, he's brought us together.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   And he is making here in Hong Kong something more powerful than we would ever be on our own.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   You matter.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   And your story of Exodus is actually part of a much bigger story of Exodus that God is doing amongst us.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   It's a beautiful, profound thing to think that God orchestrates all of this for his glory.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   But as Moses hands over his leadership to Joshua, recognizing that it is Joshua who will provide flourishing in the land of blessings.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   As we close this series, may I encourage you to continue to hand over the transition of leadership in your life to Jesus, your Joshua.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   The only one who could ever sustain and flourish you in the land of blessings.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   That, my friends, for the very final time, is what Exodus is all about.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Can we pray together? Let's pray together.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Father, I'm just so grateful for the individual mosaic tiles of people that you have here in this room and online.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Incredible people that you love so deeply despite so often our frailties.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   We thank you that you gather us up out of your compassion and grace and you shape and mold us into a new future.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   And Father, we thank you that you sent your son Jesus to be our ultimate Joshua.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   And that you provide a promised land of the kingdom of God for us to walk into.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   So that we may know the flowing milk and honey that you promise to your people, but we know it by the flowing of your spirit in us.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Lord, would you help us to take up our place?
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Would you help us to be the very people that you've called us to be by your spirit in us?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Would we take on the mantle of you leading our lives?
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   And would we recognize the times and the moments where we try to lead ourselves?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   Would we understand that a transition of our soul is always needed to flourish in the land of God's blessings and purposes?
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   And Father, I thank you that you've taken us individually on that journey.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   But you've taken us corporately and communally on that journey as well.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   And for that, we give you honor and glory and praise.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Lord, as we come out of Exodus as a series, we now step into the promised land of our city of Hong Kong.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   And we do so with all the hope, with all the life, and with all the joy that your spirit places inside of us.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Jesus, would you lead us where only you can take us?
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Would you stand with me and we're just going to close our time with a final moment of worship together.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
