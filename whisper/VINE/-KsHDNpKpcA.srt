1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Yes, so good to have you.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,920
 He has a word that's on his heart.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,760
 We're going to continue in our God of Justice sermon series.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,080
 Now we just have to pray for us, but also pray for him.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
 So why don't we do that now?

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,600
 You can stretch out your hands towards him and let's pray.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,200
 Jesus, I thank you for Chapman.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,160
 I thank you for the gifts you've laid in him.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,160
 I thank you for how you've called him and anointed him to teach.

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,760
 And I ask that you powerfully speak through his teaching, through his preaching today

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:42,240
 to us, that you open our hearts, make us good receivers of what he is sharing and what you

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,640
 want to say to us.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,200
 And may this word build up your people, Lord.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 Amen.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
 Amen.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 Thank you, Tim.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,880
 Can we put our hands together for Pastor Tim?

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
 Good morning, everyone.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
 Oh, sorry.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
 Good afternoon, everyone.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
 How are you doing?

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
 Yeah?

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,880
 Full of mooncake in your tummy?

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,200
 Yeah.

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,880
 You know, there's actually one thing in this modern world that I would say it's everywhere

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,960
 in our life.

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,760
 And as modern human beings, we're pretty used to it.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,480
 And we may even consider it a necessity in our lives.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,760
 It's everywhere.

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,040
 Wherever you go, you will see them around you multiple times every day.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,400
 And you may even feel a little bit anxious if you don't get to see it in a day.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,800
 And you probably can't start your day or can't leave your house before looking at it.

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,640
 Anyone knows what I'm talking about?

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 What?

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,160
 Cell phone?

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,680
 I'm actually talking about a mirror.

38
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
 Mirrors, right?

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,160
 Okay.

40
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,160
 Have a good look of yourself.

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,200
 Mirrors, it's one of the most important tools, not just in our daily lives, I believe, but

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,640
 also in our early developmental stages as our brains begin to comprehend the idea or

43
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,620
 the concept of self.

44
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,720
 In fact, we actually bought this mirror for Megan when she was still like newborn.

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,420
 It's the very, you know, service on which Megan and Mabel first saw their own reflection

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,600
 and start to develop this idea of self in their tiny little brains.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,480
 According to cognitive psychologists, like children, actually they only start to recognize

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,400
 the mirror images as, you know, themselves, as who they are, as around 18 months.

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,720
 So when a newborn face a mirror, look into the mirror, it would thought, oh, this is

50
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
 somebody else.

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,080
 This is someone else.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,620
 And the psychologists, they actually came up with a test, quite lame the name, it's

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,140
 just a mirror test.

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,860
 And what's this mirror test about?

55
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,620
 They actually put a mark on the baby's face and let the baby face the mirror.

56
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,300
 If the baby saw the image in the mirror and touch their own face, that means they are

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,820
 showing that they recognize the reflection as themselves.

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:17,500
 If they're trying to touch the mirror, means, sorry, they don't recognize that mirror image

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,420
 being themselves yet.

60
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,880
 You know, before the invention of selfie cameras about 15 years ago on our smartphones, mirrors,

61
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,660
 it has been one of the primary tool for thousands of years, allowing quick access or internet

62
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,740
 access to our own reflection.

63
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,500
 We look into mirrors every day, often without realizing something very important.

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,260
 Like we just come and look, and I remember when I was a teenager, when I was in school,

65
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,500
 you know, boys, we started like gelling our hair around like when we were teenagers, and

66
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,900
 girls would tease us, because every time we walked past a mirror, like, it's an instinct.

67
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,860
 We would just, oh, okay, let me fix my hair.

68
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,060
 And remember my friends, they teased me about that.

69
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,200
 But we look into a mirror every day.

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,280
 We look at ourselves, we look at our own image, but sometimes we don't realize something.

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,780
 We actually have a relationship with the person who is staring back at us.

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,020
 We have a relationship with this person in the mirror.

73
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,420
 We have a relationship with ourselves.

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:28,900
 So some of you may remember my story, if you've been here long enough.

75
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,720
 When I was in kindergarten, I stole money from my dad.

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,340
 And he was furious, he was angry, and he lectured me with the story of the boy cry wolf, or

77
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,000
 the moral of the story.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,260
 This is what he told me exactly.

79
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,100
 He said, if you have stolen once in your life, for the rest of your life, people would consider

80
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,380
 you a thief.

81
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,560
 And I remember as a very young kid, I was still in kindergarten, and five or six years

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,200
 old back then, as a very young kid, whenever I look into one of these, when I look into

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,560
 a mirror, I hated what I saw.

84
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,340
 I saw a bad person, I saw a thief.

85
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,900
 I saw someone whom I felt was ugly.

86
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,900
 Look at this guy, so ugly, I hated him.

87
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,940
 It was only when I grew up, when I was much older, that I realized the experience or the

88
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,820
 feelings, the emotions I feel towards that person inside the mirror, or more precisely,

89
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,700
 the feeling I feel about myself, was actually called shame.

90
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,980
 And shame is slightly different from guilt, and I'm going to explain a little bit about

91
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,500
 that later.

92
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,020
 But interestingly, if we open this book, the Bible, if we turn our pages to Genesis 3,

93
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:56,620
 if we look at the story, which we know as the story of the fall, we actually see something

94
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,180
 quite similar to my experience.

95
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,100
 And the beginning of chapter 3 of Genesis actually talks about how the serpent came

96
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,460
 and tempted Adam and Eve, telling them, "You know, you should eat that fruit, and blah,

97
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,180
 blah, blah, how good it is."

98
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,820
 And so I'm going to start from Genesis 3, verse 6.

99
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,060
 When the woman saw the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and

100
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,120
 also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.

101
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,020
 She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.

102
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,220
 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked.

103
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,140
 So they sewed fake leaves together and made coverings for themselves.

104
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,420
 That's the story.

105
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,080
 The opening verses of Genesis 3 told us a story of how, you know, wow, they were tempted.

106
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,820
 They were tempted to rebel against God, to rebel against Him by rejecting His authority,

107
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,900
 rejecting His definition of good and evil.

108
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,260
 And when they eat that fruit, it means from now on, they want to be like God.

109
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,380
 They will be the one who make their own judgment about good and evil.

110
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,940
 They are the one who's going to make that decision in their lives.

111
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,440
 And let's look at what happened in verse 7.

112
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:22,120
 It says, "Then their eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked."

113
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,900
 Not that they were not before eating that fruit.

114
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,660
 They realized they were naked, so they, you know, put fake leaves together and make coverings

115
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,320
 for themselves.

116
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,140
 If we want to better understand what really happened in that moment when they ate the

117
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,980
 fruit, we need to read this verse side by side with the last verse of Genesis 2.

118
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,260
 So let's read that.

119
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:52,900
 Genesis 2, verse 25 says this, "Adam and his wife Eve were both naked, and they felt no

120
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,620
 shame."

121
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:02,140
 So now suddenly they realized they were naked, and they had to cover themselves.

122
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:08,220
 In other words, shame came into their hearts after sin.

123
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:16,420
 When they rejected God, the first consequence was they also immediately rejected themselves.

124
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,140
 They rejected their own body.

125
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,780
 They feel ashamed of themselves.

126
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,660
 And shame, like I said just now, is different from guilt.

127
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,380
 Yes, I do experience a bit of guilt when I stole money from my dad, but what runs deeper

128
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,060
 was actually shame.

129
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,780
 Guilt is the awful feeling you feel towards yourself when you've done something wrong,

130
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,660
 but shame, it runs much deeper.

131
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:47,420
 Shame is the feeling that something is fundamentally wrong or inadequate about yourself.

132
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,500
 It's a feeling that I'm not good enough.

133
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,380
 And that's the exact feeling I grew up with until I was a teenager or until actually I

134
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,020
 was much older.

135
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,900
 When our relationship with God was severed or broken, the first collateral damage, it's

136
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,180
 actually our relationship with ourselves.

137
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,260
 And you may like, "Hold on a second.

138
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,460
 Isn't that the relationship of us with others?"

139
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,140
 Let's look here.

140
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,500
 They only started blaming each other.

141
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,660
 They only started pointing finger at each other much later when God came and spoke to

142
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,180
 them and held them accountable to what they've done.

143
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:35,620
 In other words, the disruptions of their relationship with others only came later, but the immediate

144
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,860
 effect of their rejection of God was the rejection of themselves.

145
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:48,100
 Shame immediately flooded into their hearts and they start to say, "I'm not good enough.

146
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,620
 My body is not good enough.

147
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,900
 I must cover it.

148
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,420
 I must not show anyone my body."

149
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,740
 But you may ask, "Why in the world did our relationship with ourselves break down so

150
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,940
 rapidly when our relationship with God is disrupted?"

151
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,020
 So this is what I'm going to unpack with you guys today.

152
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
 Is that all right?

153
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
 Cool?

154
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
 All right.

155
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,300
 So if you remember in the past two weeks, Pasitim, actually he was explaining to us

156
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,300
 how God created Adam and Eve and the rest of us.

157
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:26,860
 In his original plan, he wanted us to experience shalom, peace, harmony in four different relational

158
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
 contexts.

159
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,740
 And I put his slide back on the screen for us.

160
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,580
 Those four relational contexts would be us with God, us with ourselves, us with others,

161
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,500
 and us with creation.

162
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,940
 So originally we should be in this relationship with God.

163
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,780
 And when we're in that relationship, number one, we first experience or we first reflect

164
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
 his image.

165
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,620
 We reflect his image as his image bearer.

166
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,000
 We were created in that image.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,660
 It means we would show God's nature in the way we live, which is characterized by love,

168
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,940
 by wisdom, by holiness, justice, and creativity, and so on.

169
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,180
 And we also get to enjoy his provision.

170
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,980
 You see, God is a provider.

171
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,840
 He made a beautiful garden of Eden.

172
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,100
 And when he was done, he put Adam and Eve in a garden.

173
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,300
 And he told them, "You can eat from any trees here, any tree.

174
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,060
 If you see any fruits, feel free, be my guest and eat it, except that one.

175
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,740
 Don't eat from that one.

176
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,580
 Don't eat from that one, okay?"

177
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,360
 But they still experienced God's very abundant provision.

178
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,260
 They have everything they've ever needed or wanted.

179
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,540
 And thirdly, we have a God-given purpose when we're in a relationship with God.

180
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,560
 We were supposed to rule over creation.

181
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,820
 This purpose wasn't about selfish domination, but it's about stewardship.

182
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,980
 It's about care.

183
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,860
 It's about partnership with God in governing creation.

184
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:08,680
 So here, God's image, his provision, and his purpose, together, they gave Adam and Eve

185
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,700
 identity and security.

186
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,400
 But when they rejected God and severed their relationship with God, they were driven out

187
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,880
 of the garden, and they were driven out of the very presence of God.

188
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,880
 They were cut off from that source of their identity and security.

189
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,640
 As they rejected God's authority and sought autonomy, trying to rule over themselves instead

190
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,080
 of ruling over creation according to God's standard of good and evil, their identity

191
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:48,880
 of their understanding of who they are, or in other words, their self-image, it's no

192
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,800
 longer rooted in who God is and in God's image.

193
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:01,640
 And so we see in Genesis 3, verse 7, that's the consequence of their rejection of God.

194
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:09,760
 When our self-image is no longer anchored in the image of God, we're left with shame,

195
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,560
 self-rejection, and insecurity.

196
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,640
 And in the world around us, we would often see how people try to build their own identity

197
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,360
 or self-image without God, without being in a relationship with him.

198
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,600
 Some of the common things that people build their self-image on are achievements, to begin

199
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,920
 with, appearance, power, some of the things maybe you're familiar, maybe you see that

200
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
 around you.

201
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,240
 If you're an adult, we often see how people try to build their identity on their career,

202
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
 right?

203
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,480
 Achievements would mean your career, your position or your ranking, your income, your

204
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,160
 bank account.

205
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,120
 People who don't build their security in God, they don't have God's provision, they have

206
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
 to provide for themselves.

207
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,280
 And what they do is they save up more and more and more and more and more for themselves,

208
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:10,920
 and their identity, their image, it's self-image is built on the bank account and the resources

209
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,480
 in their possession.

210
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,960
 Or maybe if you're a student in this house, achievements could mean your grades, the school

211
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:29,280
 you go to, all those different awards or certificates, grade A piano or other things that, you know,

212
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,000
 whatsoever that you receive as some sort of a proof, and you get the idea.

213
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,400
 The idea behind is always the same.

214
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,840
 When we talk about achievements, we're talking about we are what we do, we are what we have,

215
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,760
 we are what we know.

216
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,160
 And perhaps some people, they build their self-image or self-esteem upon their appearance.

217
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,800
 You have to look a certain way, you need to have a certain body size, or you have to have

218
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,680
 a certain body shape to meet the standard of beauty in our world.

219
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:11,800
 And the world around us is actively redefining what is good, what is beautiful, what is successful,

220
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,720
 what is acceptable.

221
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,720
 And when our identity and our self-image is not anchored in God's image and our relationship

222
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,360
 with Him, we would often find ourselves in a place where we feel we're not good enough.

223
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,560
 Like I'm not strong, I'm not muscular, you know, enough.

224
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,240
 I'm not like Ivan, I'm not as strong as him, I'm not as good looking as him, I'm not as

225
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,240
 successful as Pastor Tim, I don't have the degrees that he have, and I'm nobody, I don't

226
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,280
 earn as much money as my peers.

227
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,360
 And we often compare ourselves and we feel we're shameful of ourselves, we're not good

228
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,520
 enough.

229
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,280
 When our relationship, when our self-image is not anchored in our relationship with God,

230
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,200
 that's how we always feel about ourselves.

231
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,960
 And we will find ourselves in a place where we're just always crying out and say, "Oh,

232
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,840
 I wish I'm like someone else.

233
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,240
 I wish I have that.

234
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,400
 I wish I know that.

235
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,480
 I wish I could have achieved that."

236
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,160
 You know, there's shame and that's the shame and insecurity inside of us talking to us.

237
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,800
 And that voice, sometimes it could be so loud in our heads, it could be so overwhelming

238
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,000
 in our heads that we would fall into anxiety.

239
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,960
 Do you know that there is a new buzzword in this generation, Gen Z, it's called BDD or

240
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,520
 it's called Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

241
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,160
 There's an equivalent term in Cantonese, in Chinese as well.

242
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,800
 It basically reverts to the mental health condition where a person is spending too much

243
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,600
 time worrying about the flaws in their appearance.

244
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,480
 Do you know that there are students right now, even after COVID, they never take off

245
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,360
 their mask when they're in school, when they're in social gatherings, simply because they're

246
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,520
 not confident about their appearance.

247
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,400
 There are people, they think, "This is not good enough.

248
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,720
 I shouldn't show people."

249
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,320
 Like Adam and Eve, they decided to hide it behind a mask or something.

250
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,280
 Do you know that this world around us, businesses around us, they're trying to profit on our

251
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:35,320
 own insecurity about our self-image, about who we are or how we look.

252
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,160
 Let me give you an example.

253
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,360
 I used to have a gym membership.

254
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,040
 Hard to believe.

255
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,680
 Yes, I actually do have a gym membership a while ago.

256
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,640
 But I remember when I used to go to the gym and when I start working out, some sort of

257
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,440
 a trainer would walk up to me and say, "Hey, you're doing this wrong.

258
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,480
 Your posture is not right.

259
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
 You're going to get hurt.

260
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,800
 You're not going to lose weight.

261
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
 You're not going to get your muscles built.

262
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,320
 This is wrong."

263
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,840
 And then later they will ask me, "So why are you here?

264
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
 What do you want to achieve?"

265
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,340
 And I'm like, "What else?

266
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,640
 Why else would I be here?

267
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,320
 Everybody comes to the gym, wants to be healthy, right?

268
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,120
 Am I going to tell him, 'Oh, I want to be sick and I want to look weak when I'm old,

269
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,920
 so that's why I come to gym?'"

270
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,280
 You don't say that, right?

271
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,320
 Everybody wants to be healthy, but then that's what they will tell you.

272
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,280
 "Oh, healthy, it's very fake.

273
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,560
 It's not a concrete idea.

274
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,680
 What do you mean by being healthy?

275
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,080
 Do you want to grow muscles?

276
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
 Do you want to lose weight?

277
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,520
 Do you want to do that or that or that or that?"

278
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,520
 Only later did I understand these are actually gaslighting tactics, you know?

279
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,800
 They're just questioning everything I say, and then they will pull me to the side and

280
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,120
 ask me to do this test.

281
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,520
 They have certain machines, and I'll stand on that machine measuring my body weight,

282
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,480
 my body, what body fat or, you know, something, BMI, whatever.

283
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,640
 And by the time the test result come out, they would have told me 10 or 20 things about

284
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,120
 my body, about my posture, about me that is wrong, that's not good enough.

285
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,520
 Of course, they're going to end, they're going to bring that home with a sales pitch.

286
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,800
 "Hey, so Mr. Fu, now you have to sign up with this package.

287
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,960
 And if you come, how many times per week if you commit to that exercise?

288
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,080
 If you commit to letting me show you how to do it, and I guarantee within certain months

289
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,680
 you'll reach your target, your goal."

290
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,600
 And I even remember these trainer or sales, I don't know what they really are, telling

291
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,160
 me, "Oh, you know what?

292
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,520
 My clients normally, on average, they give me like 15K, 20K per month to reach the targets."

293
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,160
 And I'm like, "Really?"

294
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,440
 You know, there are people try to earn money, try to make a profit out of our insecurity

295
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,160
 about our self-image.

296
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,480
 You know that.

297
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,280
 First of all, I'm not against gym membership.

298
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,680
 I'm not against bodybuilding.

299
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,760
 I'm not against working out.

300
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,640
 I just want to call out an injustice around us, that people are making profit out of our

301
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,520
 insecurity of our self-image.

302
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,840
 And I just want to call that out.

303
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,040
 You know, as I mentioned before, 15 years ago, the only tool that you can use to see

304
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,480
 the reflection of yourself, to see your physical self-image was mirrors.

305
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,360
 But 15 years ago, Apple came out with a brilliant product.

306
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,040
 Now everybody has one in your pocket.

307
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,200
 And what you do with it, it's you use a selfie camera.

308
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,480
 You don't just take a picture of yourself.

309
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,680
 You don't just post a picture of yourself.

310
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,480
 You can actually edit that image.

311
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,960
 You can actually touch up that image.

312
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:05,120
 You put tons of filter, Photoshop, make your nose or chin smaller, eyes bigger, you know,

313
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,920
 slimmer, taller, before you put that image on social media.

314
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,760
 Every single time you interact with that device, every single time you try to do that, you

315
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:22,640
 are trained, your brain is told that who you are, how you look, your raw and candid image,

316
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,040
 it's not good enough.

317
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,220
 It's not good enough for internet.

318
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,360
 It's not good enough for your friends.

319
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,780
 It's not good enough for the world.

320
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,580
 You must edit it.

321
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,480
 You must change something about yourselves before you can show the rest of the world

322
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
 who you are.

323
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
 We're trained to do that.

324
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,720
 We're discipled to do that.

325
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,120
 Can you believe it?

326
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,200
 We're told every single day when we interact with this device that we are not good enough.

327
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
 How we look, our appearance, it's not good enough.

328
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,320
 You got to do something about it.

329
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,560
 OMG.

330
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,780
 Imagine we have a whole generation growing up like that and we growing up like that.

331
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,000
 When a self image isn't anchored in God's image and his relationship or his view of

332
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,920
 us, shame takes the driver's seat and leaving us vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation.

333
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,320
 That's what the world around us is trying to do that.

334
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,840
 We aren't always just the victims, aren't we?

335
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,520
 Friends, if we're honest with ourselves, especially as we seek to gain power and control over

336
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:37,120
 ourselves, over situations we're in and over others, sometimes we put labels on people

337
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
 around us.

338
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,720
 We call them names.

339
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,960
 We diminish them and we don't see them or treat them like as the image of God.

340
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,160
 We do that ourselves as well.

341
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,080
 I do that myself.

342
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:57,320
 And I just want to say that, you know, we talked about how shame and insecurity came

343
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,580
 into the picture as we reject God and detach a self image from his image.

344
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,480
 But at the same time, we need to know this.

345
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 The act of rebellion also shifted our focus away from God's will and place our own desires

346
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,680
 at the center of our lives.

347
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,040
 Before the fall, Adam and Eve, they enjoy harmony with God, with themselves, with each

348
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,680
 other, with creation, and their desires were rightly ordered.

349
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,560
 Their desires used to align with God's will.

350
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,640
 They seek the glory of God naturally.

351
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,560
 They seek the good of others in what they do.

352
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,840
 However, after sin entered the world, the immediate effect was that humanity began to

353
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,400
 live for themselves rather than for God.

354
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,240
 This introduced self-centeredness into our lives.

355
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:57,160
 As we now prioritize our own desires, our own opinions, our own needs over God's authority

356
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:04,520
 and over the well-being of others around us, now the natural inclination of humanity become

357
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,280
 twisted to us selfishness.

358
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,280
 And that's what sin did to us as well.

359
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,440
 And self-centeredness or selfishness is the root of all the wickedness and injustice that

360
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,520
 we see in our world.

361
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,280
 Let me say that again.

362
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:28,260
 This self-centeredness, us prioritizing our own desires, our own opinion, our own needs

363
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:34,480
 over other people, over God's authority, this self-centeredness or selfishness is the root

364
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,720
 to all wickedness and injustice that we see in our world.

365
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,600
 As Pastor Tim explained to us two weeks ago, the wicked are those who will to disadvantage

366
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,440
 the community for the advantage of themselves.

367
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,680
 They are willing to sacrifice other people for their own good.

368
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,360
 Why do you think women are being sold into sex trade or trafficked?

369
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,200
 Because there are certain people, mostly men.

370
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,960
 They prioritize their own sexual desires and needs and wants over the well-being of those

371
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,700
 ladies.

372
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,840
 And that doesn't just happen in brothels, come on.

373
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,360
 It happens in our office.

374
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,280
 When someone prioritize their own desires, their own gain, their own control over other

375
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,040
 people, over their colleagues in the office.

376
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,560
 And we just call them horrible bosses.

377
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,520
 But that also happens in the houses of our city.

378
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,880
 Look at the divorce rate.

379
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,580
 Look at the cases, number of cases of domestic violence in our city.

380
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,520
 It happens in a household.

381
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,520
 It happens perhaps in our own family.

382
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,600
 And if we are honest with ourselves, if we dare to examine our own lives, we know we're

383
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,180
 not immune.

384
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:04,260
 Most of us in this room, we're not immune to shame and insecurity, but also we're not

385
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,060
 immune to self-centeredness and selfishness.

386
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,380
 And that's reality.

387
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,660
 But this is where Jesus comes into our story.

388
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,280
 Jesus, he's fully God, and he's also fully man.

389
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,260
 When he entered this world, he experienced the same vulnerabilities, temptations, and

390
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,980
 struggles as we do.

391
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,820
 Just as Adam and Eve were tempted by the serpent in the garden, Jesus was tempted by Satan

392
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,580
 in the wilderness at the beginning of his ministry.

393
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:42,940
 What's striking in both cases or the core of every temptation is the same.

394
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,340
 It is that the devil always tries to sow doubt into the relationship between us and God,

395
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:54,620
 to undermine our trust in his goodness and plan.

396
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,220
 Satan always tries to separate us from God by sowing doubt into that relation, by sowing

397
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,860
 unbelief into that relationship.

398
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,940
 Satan always tries to offer us an alternative to trusting God and obeying God.

399
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,340
 He will say, "Hey, here's a better option, pal.

400
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,800
 You know, yeah, of course, you can do it God's way.

401
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,380
 You can, you know, let a yes be yes, let a no be no.

402
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,580
 You can go to your boss in his office and tell him what you've done wrong.

403
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,180
 Yeah, that's God's way.

404
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
 You can do it.

405
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,800
 Hey, but I'm telling you, there's another way out.

406
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,460
 You can just, you know, sweep it under the rug as though nothing happened.

407
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,820
 He'll never find out.

408
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
 Nobody will find out.

409
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,940
 And maybe you would even get a bonus at the end of the year.

410
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
 Come on.

411
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,260
 Are you dumb?

412
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,140
 This is the better way, right?

413
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,500
 The alternative is the better way.

414
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,900
 Satan always comes and sows doubt inside of our heads.

415
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,580
 It's always God's way versus our way.

416
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,900
 And he will always try to convince you that our way will be better.

417
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,700
 Come on, let's do this.

418
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,520
 And this is his tactics.

419
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,700
 And this is what he's trying to do in our hearts.

420
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,540
 Come on, let's do it your way.

421
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,220
 Don't do it God's way.

422
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,620
 If you think about the parallels between these two moments of temptations of Jesus's temptation

423
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:24,580
 in the wilderness and Adam and Eve's in the garden, you can see that Adam and Eve, they

424
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,820
 were actually in a beautiful garden.

425
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,780
 They were surrounded by abundance.

426
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,140
 They get everything they want.

427
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,480
 And yet they gave in to the serpent's deception.

428
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,940
 They questioned God's goodness while they're living right in the middle of his goodness.

429
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,340
 They questioned God's goodness.

430
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,740
 They doubted his word and sought autonomy apart from God.

431
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,580
 And they gave into the temptation by prioritizing their own desires over God's will and his

432
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,260
 word.

433
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,420
 And on the other hand, Jesus, he was in the barren wilderness.

434
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,100
 He was physically weak after 40 days of fasting.

435
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,060
 And he was facing temptation.

436
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,740
 So that temptation, it's about doubt whether God would remain, you know, God would provide

437
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,260
 for him.

438
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,580
 And the temptation that he could misuse his own power to take a shortcut to the glory

439
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,660
 that he wants to take.

440
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,160
 And yet in each scenario, in all instances, Jesus remained obedient to God.

441
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:35,900
 In other words, he overcame the temptation by prioritizing God's will and God's glory

442
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,500
 over his own desires.

443
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,220
 Isn't that what he prayed before he went to the cross?

444
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,420
 "Father, please take away this cup, but not my will be done, your will be done."

445
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:54,420
 He prioritized God's heart, God's will, God's glory above his own desires and his own needs.

446
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,700
 And that's what he did.

447
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:05,340
 He securely anchors his own identity in his relationship with his father.

448
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
 That's how he did it.

449
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:14,140
 He did it as God's son, fully man, but also fully the son of God.

450
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:21,380
 Do you remember in the Galatians series, a couple weeks, months ago, we talked about

451
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:30,180
 when Jesus redeemed us, he gave us sonship so that we are now sons and daughters of God.

452
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:38,660
 And God sent his spirit of his son into our hearts so that we could call him Abba, Father.

453
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,160
 That he restored that intimate relationship between us and him.

454
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:49,500
 When our relationship with him is restored, it means that our source of identity, our

455
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,620
 source of security is also restored.

456
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:00,140
 We can anchor our identity and our self-image in this bonding we have with him once again.

457
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,460
 Meaning that yes, maybe before you come here today, before you know Jesus, your identity,

458
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,020
 your self-image is anchored or built upon your achievements or maybe your appearance

459
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
 or maybe the power you have.

460
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:20,180
 But today when your relationship with Father God is restored, now you can shift that self-image,

461
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:27,140
 your anchor of your identity back into your relationship with him, back into his image.

462
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:35,140
 So because I'm created by God and I'm redeemed by him, now I know for sure that I'm his son,

463
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:41,300
 that I'm good despite every wrong I've done in my life, that I'm fearfully and wonderfully

464
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,140
 made, that I'm his craftsmanship.

465
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,020
 Therefore I'm not useless.

466
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:53,580
 And I know I'm beautiful, I'm precious, I'm significant, and I have a glorious purpose

467
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,240
 in my life.

468
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,040
 And I know that he would look after me and he provides for my every need.

469
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:09,260
 When my self-image, it's anchored once again in God's image, I know all these for sure

470
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,300
 and I have certainty in my heart.

471
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:18,220
 I no longer experience that insecurity, but now I have security inside of me.

472
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,180
 And that's wonderful, right?

473
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,760
 But let me tell you, church, Jesus did more than that.

474
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,240
 And let me read to you how Paul described him in Philippians chapter 2.

475
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,680
 Philippians chapter 2, starting verse 3, he says this, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition

476
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,560
 or vain conceit.

477
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,180
 Rather in humility value others above yourself, not looking to your own interests but each

478
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,480
 of you to the interests of others.

479
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:54,280
 In your relationship with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus, who being

480
00:32:54,280 --> 00:33:00,760
 in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used in his own advantage.

481
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:07,540
 Rather he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human

482
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:14,460
 likeness and being found in appearances as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient

483
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,780
 to death, even death on a cross."

484
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:24,840
 Jesus didn't come to die, didn't just come to die so that our sins can be forgiven.

485
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,760
 Yes, that's part of the deal, that's amazing, hallelujah.

486
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,340
 But he also came to suffer and die on the cross for us, to show us that it's humanly

487
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:41,840
 possible to prioritize God's glory and the wellbeing of others over ourselves.

488
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,280
 Jesus, he's not self-centered, he's other-centered.

489
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:58,200
 And Paul said, "Have the same mindset as Christ Jesus, the other-centered mindset."

490
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,540
 Just now we talk about what wickedness mean.

491
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:07,880
 The wicked are those who will disadvantage the community or others for the advantage

492
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,800
 of themselves.

493
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,960
 Jesus showed us the opposite, he showed us what righteousness, what justice is actually

494
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
 like.

495
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,000
 The righteous are those who will to disadvantage themselves for the advantage of their community,

496
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,120
 of those around them, of the neighbors.

497
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:35,980
 You see, it's possible, Jesus made a way, he show us that justice on earth in this life,

498
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,340
 it's possible by the blood of Jesus, through the power of the Holy Spirit.

499
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:47,080
 Perhaps you still see insecurity and shame and even self-centeredness and selfishness

500
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
 in yourself.

501
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,660
 And if I'm honest with you, I see that in myself as well.

502
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:57,720
 I see that, I see how sin has affected me, maybe you share that same feeling today, but

503
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,680
 let me read you one more passage from the New Testament.

504
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,760
 In the Hebrews chapter four it says this, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest

505
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,080
 who has ascended into heaven, Jesus, the son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we

506
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
 profess.

507
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,960
 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weakness, but we have

508
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,480
 one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet he did not sin."

509
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,720
 So let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, without fear, so that we

510
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:44,280
 may receive mercy and find grace to help us in a time of need.

511
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,640
 Jesus, he's able to empathize with our weaknesses.

512
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,080
 He understands the shame you're carrying, he understands the insecurity, he understands

513
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,120
 why you need to anchor your identity on your achievements, on your appearance, on your

514
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,120
 power.

515
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
 He understand all that.

516
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,320
 He even understand the self-centeredness, the selfishness that is going on inside of

517
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,000
 you that is taking a hold of your life, but he could empathize with that weakness and

518
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,800
 he restores us back to the father.

519
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,120
 So that in exchange of that insecurity and shame, now we can approach God with confidence,

520
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,080
 without fear instead.

521
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,040
 Jesus says, "I'm the way, I'm the truth, I'm the life.

522
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,880
 Through me, you have access to the father, no fear at all."

523
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,520
 And the father's throne, it's actually a throne of grace.

524
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,780
 You don't deserve it, I don't deserve it, but Jesus made that grace, made that mercy

525
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,560
 available for all of us before we could bring him any merits.

526
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,120
 Because I'm created by God and I'm his son, I know I'm good and I know we could receive

527
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,000
 that.

528
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,960
 We have the Holy Spirit inside of us.

529
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,360
 Every resource we need to live the life like Jesus, it's already inside of us, freely available

530
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,440
 to us right now.

531
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,840
 God has reconciled us back to him.

532
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,360
 Our relationship with him is restored.

533
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,840
 We can live as God's image bearer once again.

534
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,640
 Our self-image can be anchored in his image again.

535
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,040
 We're his sons and daughters, we can feel secure inside of him.

536
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:36,040
 About 10 years ago, well, I should say that throughout my life in the last 20 years, one

537
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,480
 of the ministries I involved in, it's translation.

538
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,240
 I would go to Christian conferences and translate for pastors.

539
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,040
 I've done that for our pastors here as well.

540
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,120
 That's what I do in the city.

541
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:53,520
 About 10 years ago, I was introduced to a music ministry, but they're not an English

542
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,500
 music ministry, they're actually a Mandarin music ministry.

543
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,280
 They asked me to go and translate at their event, which I've never done before.

544
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,280
 And I remember the first day I arrived at that conference, at that event, there are

545
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,520
 other Christians in the city who might know, my friends, they welcomed me, they cheered

546
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,320
 for me, they said, "Wow, Chapman is here, the best translator, whatever, it's here."

547
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,800
 And I remember going there for the first time, I haven't even done this in my life before.

548
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,360
 I was so nervous, what if I screw up, what if I don't even understand one word coming

549
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,160
 out of that speaker's mouth, and I just stood there and I froze, what if that happened?

550
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,680
 So all these scenarios were running inside of my head, I was like shaking, and I'm like,

551
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:43,760
 I don't know if I could live up to that reputation, which I didn't even know I had won.

552
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,560
 And during rehearsal, I just stood at a backstage and I was just praying in the spirit, I'm

553
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:57,160
 like, "Holy Spirit, you must do something, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be very ugly

554
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,760
 in front of everyone, like help me."

555
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,040
 And remember the Holy Spirit just taught me to pray like this, says, "Chapman, just pray

556
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:11,080
 this after me," he says, "in Jesus' name I declare, I come here, later I'll walk on that

557
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:21,120
 stage as the Son of God, that's it, no more, no less, that's it, I'm just the Son of God,

558
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
 period."

559
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,960
 For the last 10 years, every single time before I walk on a stage, before I speak, before

560
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,400
 I do anything, that's the prayer I pray.

561
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:40,400
 I remember when I pray that prayer, all the anxiety, that nerve, it's gone.

562
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:48,000
 When I anchored my identity, my self-image in my relationship with my Father, in His

563
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,640
 image, instead of my achievements, instead of my abilities, instead of my appearance,

564
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:04,680
 whatever, I found that security that I would call my birthright once again.

565
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,640
 Do you know that security?

566
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,240
 Do you know that love?

567
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,280
 It's actually our birthright.

568
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,560
 Father God is calling us back to Him through Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit.

569
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,360
 It's possible.

570
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,120
 You can anchor your identity in Him.

571
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,800
 It's totally possible.

572
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,040
 And by the power of His Spirit, as we surrender to Him more and more every day, we will be

573
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:34,320
 capable, as His sons and daughters, we will be capable to seek His glory and the well-being

574
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,520
 of others over ourselves.

575
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,040
 We can do this so naturally, like it's a second nature.

576
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,440
 It's like breathing.

577
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,360
 And we will be capable to be other-centered.

578
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:51,880
 We will be able to disadvantage ourselves for the advantage of those around us.

579
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,400
 And it will feel like an instinct, and it may even feel like joy to us.

580
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:07,800
 Justice, it begins when the flourishing of others become our heart's desire.

581
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:15,000
 When there is a community called the church who are other-centered and with their self-image

582
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,240
 anchored in the image of God, when you have such a community in your neighborhood, people,

583
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,480
 they would start to experience what we call the restorative justice of God.

584
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:36,640
 When you allow the Holy Spirit to do that, when you anchor yourselves in His image, that's

585
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,880
 God's heart for the Vine Yuen Long.

586
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,740
 That's God's heart for His church.

587
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,600
 That's God's heart for our neighborhood.

588
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,640
 And that's His heart for Hong Kong.

589
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,320
 It's possible.

590
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,240
 Jesus made it possible for you and me.

591
00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:01,800
 Today, if you say, "I want to once again anchor my identity in Jesus, in God's image again,"

592
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:12,200
 Church, I invite you to stand and pray with me.

593
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:20,520
 God, you know the insecurities in our hearts.

594
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,340
 You know the shame that we experience.

595
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:28,440
 You know where and when we told ourselves that we're not good enough.

596
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,120
 We're not good enough for you.

597
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,680
 We're not good enough for our family.

598
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
 We're not good enough for ourselves.

599
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,080
 We're not good enough for our office, so on, so on.

600
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,680
 But God, you know.

601
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,880
 Jesus, you can empathize with our weaknesses today.

602
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,600
 And you know how we have used to build our identity on perhaps our achievements or appearance

603
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,320
 or power and all that.

604
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,360
 But God, today you restore us back to you.

605
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,960
 God, we just want to come before you.

606
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,160
 And we want to pray that in Jesus' name.

607
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,480
 We want to repent from our past.

608
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,840
 We want to turn away from building our identity in anything outside of you.

609
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,240
 In Jesus' name today, we want to come before you, Lord.

610
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:33,120
 And we declare once again, Father, my self-image, my identity, it's built upon our relationship.

611
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,120
 I want to anchor my image in your image today.

612
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,920
 So come, Holy Spirit.

613
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,680
 Father, send the spirit of your son into my heart today.

614
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,840
 So that I could have a sense of security.

615
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,520
 I could just call out right here, right now, Abba, Father, I enjoy you.

616
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,920
 I long for you.

617
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,640
 Come and fill me up.

618
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,840
 I want to be in your presence.

619
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,960
 Come, Holy Spirit.

620
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:17,560
 I want to prioritize your glory, your heart, the well-being of those around me over myself.

621
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,760
 That justice flows through me.

622
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:33,280
 We give ourselves to you, Lord.

623
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:42,920
 Today once again, we come before you, Lord.

624
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:51,280
 I know some of us here, we are so used to finding our identity and our image in what

625
00:44:51,280 --> 00:45:00,440
 we can do, in what we have, in the figures in a bank account, in the title we've earned,

626
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:10,640
 in the gifts and talents that brought us a lot of recognition in our lives.

627
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,880
 Today Jesus is offering us something better.

628
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,280
 Let's respond to him.

629
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:28,520
 Amen.

630
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,520
