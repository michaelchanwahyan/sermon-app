[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   - Amen.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.760]   - Amen, thank you Carla.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.380]   Good morning everybody.
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.120]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.420]   Good, well we are starting a brand new series
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.460]   and I wanna kick this off by telling you a story
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.140]   of, I think, when was it?
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.920]   July 3rd, 2018.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.960]   I had this experience, this really big,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.760]   life-changing, life-altering,
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.880]   hit me at my core kind of experience.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.960]   An experience, an encounter actually,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.160]   that has stayed with me every day,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.620]   literally every day since.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.400]   It has shaped who I am in so many ways.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.520]   It has given me things to think about.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.360]   It was unexpected, things didn't go according to plan,
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.320]   but it stuck with me.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.480]   I wanna share with you about the time I had dinner
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.680]   with Pastor Jethro.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160]   Who's sitting over there?
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.680]   So let me tell you about Jethro.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.040]   Back in 2018, I was new to the Vine.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.160]   I'd been here for a few months maybe.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.640]   I was a worship pastor and I was learning the ropes
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.160]   and trying to get to know everyone here.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.060]   So Jethro was a core team member.
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.600]   He was like the best keyboard player on the team.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.080]   And I'm like, I'm gonna get to know Jethro.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.320]   I'm gonna learn some things about this team.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.580]   So I ask him to dinner.
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.960]   And we're texting back and forth,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.240]   like us young people do.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.880]   And I'm like, yo Jeth, let's have dinner.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.160]   He's like, all right, cool.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.720]   Where do you wanna go?
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.200]   So this is my version of the story.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.500]   You can fact check me later if Jethro says otherwise.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.200]   But what happened was, I texted him.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.340]   I'm like, LCK, okay?
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.760]   Now, if you spend all your time on Hong Kong Island,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.740]   you don't know what LCK is.
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.000]   But if you ever go to Kowloon,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.360]   LCK stands for Lai Chi Kok, right?
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.400]   That's where I used to live.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.240]   That was my hood.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.640]   All the CIS teachers are clapping
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640]   'cause that's their hood as well.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.420]   So I say, LCK, okay?
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.600]   And that was the last of kind of
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.480]   what I thought the conversation was.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.060]   I don't know, about like 30, 45 minutes, an hour later,
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.880]   I get a message from Jethro and it says,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.140]   I'm in Wan Chai.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.200]   I'm like, what's wrong with Jethro, right?
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   Like, I'm just getting to know him.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.640]   I'm like, what's his issue?
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.760]   So I look at my phone and I'm like,
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.600]   why are you in Wan Chai?
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.400]   He goes, dinner, dot, dot, dot, question mark,
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.180]   with a little creepy eye emoji.
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.640]   So then I go back and I'm like,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.200]   why does he think we're supposed to be in?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.120]   So I go back to my messages.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.680]   I'm like, about to call him out,
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.800]   be like, buddy, learn how to read.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.760]   So I'm scrolling through and I'm like,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.520]   oh no, I realized that I had been a victim of autocorrect.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.600]   See, I had typed LCK, okay, right?
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.760]   So LCK, okay.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.320]   What came out was, pick, P-I-C-K.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.080]   So Jethro did that, he picked.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.560]   And he picked Wan Chai.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.480]   And I was in, and apparently I actually agreed to this.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.640]   So he went back and read the messages
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.600]   and apparently I'm not thinking when I'm responding.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.480]   He's like, yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure, whatever.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.200]   So I'd actually agreed to the thumbs up
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.400]   to coming to Wan Chai.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.100]   And I'm standing in Lai Chi Kok MTR waiting for Jethro.
[00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.440]   He's in Wan Chai waiting for me.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.840]   And Jethro, being the saint that he is,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.400]   leaves Wan Chai and goes all the way to Lai Chi Kok.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.480]   Let me explain, he was in Science Park up in Taipo,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.120]   came all the way down to, oh, yes, feel bad for him.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.360]   I'm a terrible friend, that's the moral of the story.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.440]   But regardless, this has never left me
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.420]   because Jethro to this day still judges me for my typos,
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.540]   regularly coming at me about the typos that I have,
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.520]   whether it's in the WhatsApp message or in like an email,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.240]   anything, he's always looking at my typos.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.200]   It's the one thing he focuses on.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.160]   To the point where my birthday was this past Thursday.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.680]   I turn 34 and I'm excited and I get my first happy birthday
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.280]   and it's from my friend Jethro, which is great.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.680]   But then online, so that everyone can see it,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.640]   he posts this beautiful post.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.400]   Thanks for coming into my life and staying into my life.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.800]   But in that same post, he's like, I love you,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.840]   typos and all.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.280]   The shade, y'all.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.480]   He just has not left me alone.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.680]   This was not just an experience,
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.120]   it was an encounter with Jethro and with proofreading
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.520]   and with autocorrect.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.720]   And let me just say, I have learned my lesson,
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.760]   or I try at least, I think I still have some typos
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.440]   here and there, but it stayed with me.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.960]   I share this because it was more than an experience,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.800]   it was an encounter, it's something that has,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.760]   it has actually shaped me.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.080]   I really do think about what I text and I do go back
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.720]   and if I'm meeting someone somewhere,
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.560]   I double check where it's at, right?
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.800]   It has stayed with me, it has shaped me in a certain way.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.980]   And encounters do this to us all.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.560]   When we have a big, meaningful encounter, it shapes us,
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.280]   it redirects us, it changes our perspective
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.360]   to some extent.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.040]   And when we have encounters with God,
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.080]   well, that changes us even more.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.200]   It seems like the impacts that come from an encounter
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.840]   with God somehow are more magnified.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.400]   They are multiplied to a higher degree.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.760]   When we have an encounter with God,
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.080]   it shapes our intimacy with him,
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.600]   it helps us to get to know him better.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.860]   When we have an encounter with God,
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.240]   we get shaped and molded more into his likeness.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.720]   We become more like him when we encounter him.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.240]   And these encounters help us see God more clearly.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.060]   These encounters help us shake lies
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.340]   that we once believed about ourselves.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.800]   It helps us shake delusions and stand on truth.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.160]   Encounters with God is important.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.560]   It's very important 'cause the effects of an encounter
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.840]   with God can last with us for the rest of our lives.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.880]   The effects of our encounters with God show us
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.960]   that we don't have to solely rely on ourselves to get by.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.600]   It's not just us looking out for us.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.920]   An encounter with God, God encounters us
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.960]   to show us that we are not alone in this
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.920]   and all that we do.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.000]   So with this in mind,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.760]   we've designed this five-week sermon series
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.760]   to look at five very familiar passages in the Old Testament,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   some key biblical figures that you might have heard of,
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   might have read before, and their encounters,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000]   hoping that as we look and see the moments
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.640]   where God showed up, it would encourage us
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.960]   to allow God to show up in unexpected ways
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.480]   at unexpected times in our lives
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.160]   'cause it seems like when we allow those things to happen,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.440]   we get changed at our core.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   I pray that it allows you to posture yourself
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.880]   as we study these encounters to become open
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.640]   to a holy disruption that will shake who you are
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.960]   to the core of who you are.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.080]   Does that sound okay?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   So that's where we're gonna be going.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.400]   So let me just bring this up to us
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.960]   and kind of give us a good working definition
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.800]   of an encounter.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.560]   Encounters with God are these impactful moments,
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.720]   oftentimes unexpected, unprepared for, unanticipated,
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.640]   yet they end up changing us,
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.440]   helping us see God more truly for who he is
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.600]   and who we are, giving us strength,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.840]   giving us confidence and resolve.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.240]   This is what an encounter of God can do.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.600]   But it's good to know that encounters
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.020]   don't all look the same.
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.440]   They don't all happen the same way.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.240]   Encounters aren't just limited to certain kinds of people.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.680]   I think by nature, we might think an encounter with God
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.840]   must mean that we are living rightfully
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.880]   and we are the most holy of people.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.120]   But encounters of God we'll see range from men to women,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.200]   to priests, to sinners, to liars, to anybody.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.320]   So many people can encounter God.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.760]   And I say that because I want you to know
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.680]   that you don't have to have all your stuff together
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.220]   to have an encounter with God.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.960]   You don't have to be a certain level of Christian
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.840]   to encounter God.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.200]   Like I said, encounters don't all take place
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.040]   in the same way.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.200]   Some encounters take place in a cave.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.080]   Some encounters take place on mountaintops.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.160]   Some encounters take place in the flames
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.400]   of Nebuchadnezzar's furnace.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.360]   Some encounters take place in the temple.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.000]   Some encounters take place in the room.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Some encounters take place at the Ford of Jabbok,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.040]   crossing over and exist with the wrestling of God.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.520]   So today our first encounter we're gonna look at
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.580]   is a man who is a liar, who's a thief,
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.040]   who swindles, who doesn't have it all right,
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.260]   who cheats to get ahead.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.960]   We're gonna look at the man called Jacob today.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.320]   Jacob's, well, there's a Jacob here.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.240]   I'm sorry, bro.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.040]   Jacob has a wild story.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.120]   He's a twin.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.760]   He's a younger brother, right?
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.720]   And God would tell his mother that the youngest son
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.760]   would lead the oldest.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.520]   I think the verbatim is the oldest will bow down
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.360]   and submit to the younger one.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.600]   This was Jacob's prophecy.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.680]   This was counter-cultural.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.640]   This wasn't normal.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.320]   Normally the inheritance and the blessing
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.840]   goes to the oldest son, but Jacob as a twin
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.200]   ends up being the second son, and there's a promise
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.160]   that he would be the one to carry it forward.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.680]   And it's important that we understand Jacob's name
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.560]   'cause names mean something.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.160]   Names are not just, you know, what's popular,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.120]   top 100 girl names or guy names this year.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.840]   Names were super significant.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.760]   You named someone something because you wanted
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.200]   to see something in them or in a response to a promise
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.760]   or because God had done something.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.480]   So your name was a sense of your identity.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.160]   A name was a sense of foreshadowing or reputation.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.400]   And Jacob's name would mean the supplanter
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.440]   or the heel grabber because, silly enough,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.680]   when he came out of the womb, he was holding on
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.360]   to his brother's heel.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.560]   So his parents saw that and they're like,
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.000]   oh, this guy's ambitious.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.960]   We're gonna call him Jacob.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.800]   And that would be his name.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.640]   In Genesis 26, God would tell Rebecca
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.560]   that the children wrestle and struggle inside of you.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.640]   Jacob would earn the full aspect of his name later on,
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.480]   which I think some of us who are familiar
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.560]   would think Jacob means deceiver.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.720]   So for those of us familiar with the story,
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   Jacob tricks his older brother Esau.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.400]   He deceives him into selling his birthright for some stew,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   for some stew.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   I mean, talk about a low bar.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.880]   So his brother sells his birthright.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.040]   Jacob ends up taking it.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.400]   Jacob ends up lying in the inheritance swap
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.480]   and he takes what was just meant for his brother.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.280]   And Esau would say this in his complaint.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.200]   Is he not rightly named Jacob
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.280]   for he has cheated me these two times?
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.840]   He took away my birthright
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.880]   and behold, he has taken away my blessing.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.360]   Jacob is a deceiver.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.120]   He's the one who steals to get ahead.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.240]   He's the one who cheats to get to first place.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.880]   He supplants or trips up his brother.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.800]   He wrestles him in the womb, wrestles him in birth,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.000]   and wrestles him in their relationship.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.120]   But don't worry, it gets better.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.000]   Jacob is holistic in his wrestling.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.040]   He doesn't just leave it to his brother.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.280]   He continues wrestling in other aspects of his life.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.760]   His brother wants to kill him
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.200]   because he has taken what belonged to him.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.680]   So Jacob runs and flees
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.720]   and he meets this woman named Rachel.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   Beautiful woman, I guess,
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.400]   because he's willing to enter into a contract
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.600]   to work seven years so that he can marry her.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.240]   The story goes he works seven years
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.600]   and he thinks he's gonna get Rachel.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.240]   On the wedding day, he actually doesn't get Rachel.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.600]   The dad tricked him.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.880]   The dad deceived him.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.240]   The dad wrestled with him.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.520]   And actually he gives him the other daughter, Leah.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.720]   And Jacob's annoyed because, Bible says this,
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.040]   Rachel was the beautiful one, Leah was not so much.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.480]   So he couldn't get Rachel because he had just gotten Leah.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   So the father's like, well, if you want Rachel,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.600]   I'm not gonna give you both of my daughters for one price.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   You have to work another seven more years.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.360]   So Jacob's been working for 14 years
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.640]   just to get the thing he thought he deserved.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.520]   Wrestling.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.360]   And it continues.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   His land and his property, his sheep and his cattle end up,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.720]   him and Laban live in the same area.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.960]   They've decided to separate into two parts of the space
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.800]   so that there would be no mixing.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.520]   And all of Laban's things would be Laban's,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.200]   all of Jacob's things would be Jacob's.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.040]   But all of Jacob's cattle are bigger and stronger
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.760]   and look better and look healthier than Laban's,
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.360]   which creates conflict between him and his father-in-law.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.200]   Wrestling.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.200]   This theme of wrestling just continues
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.080]   and continues for Jacob.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.240]   He wrestles with Esau.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.160]   He wrestles with Laban.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.040]   He uses strategy to try and figure out
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.640]   how do I get myself out of these situations?
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.320]   How do I get what I deserve?
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.240]   He fights, he wrestles.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.320]   This is just his life at this point.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.520]   But it would appear that God wanted more
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.720]   from him and of him.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.400]   And so when we take a look here at Genesis 32
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.880]   where we have that famous encounter,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.320]   starting at verse 22, it says this.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.400]   The same night he, speaking of Jacob, arose,
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.520]   took his two wives, his two female servants,
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.040]   his 11 children, crossed the ford at Jabbok.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.440]   He took them and sent them across the stream
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.400]   and everything else that he had.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   And Jacob was left alone.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.080]   And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.480]   When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob,
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.880]   he touched his hip socket and Jacob's hip
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.880]   was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.240]   Then he said, "Let me go for the day is broken."
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.280]   But Jacob said, "I will not let you go
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.040]   unless you bless me."
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.240]   And he said, "What is your name?"
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.280]   He said, "Jacob."
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.880]   Then he said, "You shall no longer be called Jacob,
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.720]   but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.880]   and have prevailed."
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.280]   Then Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.840]   But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?"
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.080]   And there he blessed him.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.800]   So Jacob called the name of this place Peniel,
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.240]   saying, "I have seen God face to face
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   and yet my life has been delivered."
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.040]   What has happened in this moment?
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.120]   Just a little bit of more context
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.160]   so that we really get this wrestle
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.960]   because this is a massive encounter with God.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.160]   This is an orthodox encounter with God.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.320]   We have to understand.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.120]   So Jacob is getting ready to go back home.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.920]   He's been away from home for all these years
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.000]   and he's carrying his family and all the things he has.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.600]   And he gets word that his brother,
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.760]   who hated him, wanted to kill him, was ahead of him.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.520]   So naturally that scares him.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   Then the word gets worse.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   His brother is with 400 men ahead of him.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.000]   Naturally, Jacob gets a little nervous,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.320]   slows down a little bit and thinks,
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.240]   "Okay, well, what do I do?
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.440]   I have a wife, I have two wives, I have kids,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.280]   I have 11 children, I have all this stuff.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.600]   How are we gonna make it if my brother
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.440]   wants revenge for what I've done?"
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.480]   He is in a desperate, broken moment.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.680]   So he gets clever.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.400]   He sends some of his best stuff ahead.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.960]   He goes, "Take this to Esau."
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.600]   And you see Esau say, "These are gifts from Jacob."
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.360]   So he tries to use a little bit of cleverness, strategy,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.280]   maybe not trickery, but a little bit of deceit.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.440]   He doesn't really wanna give him gifts.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.360]   He just doesn't wanna get killed, right?
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.200]   Makes sense.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.160]   He's doing the best that he can.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.240]   He's doing what he thinks he needs to do,
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.080]   but he's worried.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.480]   He's at his lowest point here.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.160]   He has all this stuff, yet he still is at this moment of,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.200]   "What do I do?"
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   And tension and brokenness, the unexpected, then happens.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.600]   He's unprepared, and unexpectedly,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.760]   he has this encounter with God in the form of a fight.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.840]   I'm just gonna be honest.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.280]   When I encounter God, I hope he's not trying to fight me.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.680]   Right, like that must have been a moment.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.220]   But how poetically beautiful is it
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.320]   that most of Jacob's life has been marked symbolically
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.960]   with this aspect of wrestling.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   And when he encounters God,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.240]   his encounter with him is through what?
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.400]   Through a wrestle, through a struggle.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   God meets him in a language that he is overly familiar with.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.600]   And the first thing we have to note here
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.080]   is how God meets him on these challenging terms.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.040]   The context of his situation were not ideal.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.840]   God meets him here in his mess, in his brokenness.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.560]   When we need him the most, that's when God meets us.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.660]   And I think it's something that we have to keep in mind
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.600]   because a lot of us subconsciously live in a way
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   that seeks out pleasure and avoids pain.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.560]   But what if it's in the pain
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.400]   that God plans to speak the loudest?
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.320]   What if it's in the pain that God plans on encountering you?
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.420]   If our life is constantly avoiding the difficult,
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:10.380]   do we potentially avoid these encounters with God?
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.880]   So if you're struggling,
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.860]   if you're in a place of brokenness,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.600]   if your life is going less than expected,
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.240]   if you've run into unexpected conflict and trouble
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.040]   and things just don't seem right,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.660]   if you're in your darkest place,
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.000]   if you're in a moment of tension and pain,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.600]   if your circumstances leave you desperate,
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.420]   that's an open door for an encounter.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.680]   That's what we see here in Jacob.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.860]   God has a funny way of showing up most clear
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.840]   in our darkest hours.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.160]   And so I wonder what would happen
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.480]   if in those moments of darkness,
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.380]   we sought him instead of running away?
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:54.280]   It leads me to the second thing that I notice in this story,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.840]   and that's around prayer,
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.560]   how prayer is essential to an encounter with God.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.080]   So that's exactly what Jacob does.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.760]   In verse nine, he prays.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.040]   It's gonna come up on here.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.640]   I'm just gonna read a couple of points from his prayer.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.520]   He prays to God.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.200]   He says, "You told me to return to my country
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.520]   "that you would do good.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.600]   "I'm not worthy of the least of the deeds
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.440]   "of your steadfast love and all your faithfulness
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.060]   "that you've shown me.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.440]   "For even though when I only had my staff,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.520]   "I crossed the Jordan, and now I have become two camps.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.460]   "Please deliver me from the hand of my brother,
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.240]   "from the hand of Esau," listen to this,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.120]   "for I fear him."
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.800]   I love that Jacob, when he prays in this moment,
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.280]   before he does anything, he doesn't have the best words.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.440]   This isn't like super sophisticated big man prayer, right?
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.240]   He's not using anything fancy.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.520]   He's just positioning himself authentically
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.840]   in front of God.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.560]   He doesn't have to have a seminary degree.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.360]   He doesn't have to have been in church for all his life.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.280]   He's just exposing his heart to God.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.960]   We can do this, right?
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:01.520]   We can just share where we are with God.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.600]   I mean, what would happen if we did this?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.360]   If there's something that's found
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.360]   when we turn our dependence on God into a prayer to God?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.280]   What if that's what prayer really is about,
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.800]   being honest with him and being honest with yourself,
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.600]   that perhaps you've not been worthy,
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.920]   but actually God's been good.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.000]   God has done things.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.780]   It's fascinating.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.080]   Jacob is at this point where he might get killed
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.360]   and everything he has might be destroyed,
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.440]   and he recounts the blessings of God.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.440]   He goes, "When I first got here, God,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.320]   "I just had my staff, I had nothing."
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.400]   It's the same concept of,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   I just had the clothes on my back and that's it.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.560]   But now I'm here with two camps.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.320]   He's speaking of the wealth that he's accumulated,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.880]   of family, children.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.200]   He has been blessed.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.800]   And he's thanking God, first and foremost,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.840]   I don't know how it's happened.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.440]   I don't even think I deserve it.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.560]   I've been unworthy of this, but you have been good.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.120]   He recalls the faithfulness of God.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.160]   His desperation does not blind him
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.480]   from the reality that God has been there
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.980]   and God has been blessing him.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.240]   And then his prayer changes a bit.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.040]   He pours out his heart to God.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.280]   My favorite thing that I learned in this entire passage
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.840]   when I was studying it was just,
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.680]   there's nothing I didn't learn,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.360]   I just read it and it hit me hard.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   He says, "I fear him, I fear Esau."
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.920]   That is as clear, that is as honest,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.980]   probably as vulnerable as it gets.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.920]   He's raw, he's not trying to come up
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.760]   with anything strategic, he's not trying
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.920]   to over-spiritualize or say it's this or say it's that
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.400]   or use some big fancy words.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.080]   He is just being bare in front of God.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.440]   That level of authenticity,
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.880]   that level of purely exposing where your heart is,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.760]   no pretentiousness, no big words,
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.400]   just showing God your heart.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.080]   What if that's an element to prayer?
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.720]   What if that's a powerful part of prayer?
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   What if that's the gateway?
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.480]   What if that's what kickstarts things in our life?
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.160]   Just truly coming before him and being properly honest
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.320]   about what it is we feel, about where it is we are.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:21.560]   See, Jacob, he prays,
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.160]   but he doesn't have his big encounter when he prays.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.960]   Think about that.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.960]   He says his prayer and no big moment happens.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.440]   Now the big, the encounter comes
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.080]   because he opens himself up.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.480]   He prays, nothing happens.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.880]   In the moment of praying, there's no big miracle or anything
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.280]   but praying seemed to open the door.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.120]   Prayer, therefore, is essential to an encounter with God.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.280]   See, after his prayer, I love this as well,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.600]   the Bible doesn't sugarcoat things.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.800]   Genesis is for us broken people, right?
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.160]   Jacob has this prayer, he's thanked God,
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.000]   he's been honest with God and I think for lots of us,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.760]   we think that if we just do it like that,
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.160]   then we'll become a better Christian right away.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.200]   Let's look at this one more time.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.400]   He does all these things,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.080]   he does all the right things in his prayer
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.640]   and then he goes back to strategizing.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.200]   He goes back to leaning on his own strength.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.760]   He goes back to being human.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.360]   Like he didn't all of a sudden become not human
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   all of a sudden 'cause he prayed.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.280]   I think some of us get discouraged 'cause we pray
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.240]   and we expect everything to change.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.840]   We just all of a sudden are floating on clouds
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.000]   and we're more holy.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   We no longer deal with temptation anymore.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.640]   That's actually not how it works.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.480]   We've got to have the right picture of prayer.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.800]   Sometimes you're gonna pray
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.400]   and you're still gonna struggle.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.120]   That's the reality of our life.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.880]   I'm so glad that's clear in here.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.720]   He leans back on his human tendency
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.040]   to control his next steps.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.000]   But he's opened up a door.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.840]   By praying, he's started something.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.440]   He's allowed something to happen.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.040]   And then it does, it happens.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.440]   He prayed in the beginning of the night.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.880]   Later in the night, he has his encounter with God.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.760]   And his encounter comes with a wrestle,
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.880]   which I think is weird.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.880]   Like of all the crazy things God can do
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.680]   when he encounters you, like I guess for me,
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.520]   sign me up, I don't wanna wrestle God.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.080]   I would much rather just have him talk to me
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.440]   and tell me who I am, all these things.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.280]   But Jacob ends up wrestling him.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.240]   And I'm pretty convinced Jacob had no idea
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.440]   it was God at first.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.560]   It's the dark of night.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.680]   He probably thinks maybe Esau sent somebody
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.280]   knowing I was coming to take me out.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.000]   Maybe there's thieves and robbers around
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.120]   trying to take my stuff.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.480]   I mean, I'm carrying all this stuff.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.760]   I'm a well-off guy.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.320]   He wrestles this guy, probably in self-defense.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.880]   But at some point, something clicks in his head.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.920]   This isn't human.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.080]   I'm wrestling divinity.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.440]   I am pushing against the creator of the universe.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.160]   He becomes aware that he's wrestling with God.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   And what does he do?
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.200]   He doesn't let go.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.440]   He holds on.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.560]   He digs his heels in.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.440]   He wholly commits himself to the fight.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.320]   He holds on more.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.160]   He struggles, he fights.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.400]   He even gets his hip displaced.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.440]   Fun fact, don't fight God, he'll break your hip.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.680]   That's my takeaway today.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:19.360]   But even in that space, it seems like that's when
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.160]   the change actually starts to begin.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.880]   See, the old Jacob, his strategy, his way,
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.040]   his preference in doing things was through deception.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.240]   The old Jacob would have tried to,
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.640]   when he realized this was God,
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.520]   he would have tried to deceive him.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.080]   He would have tried to supplant.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.360]   He would have tried to trick or try to get ahead
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.640]   or get something out of him.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.920]   He would have tried to get his own way.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.600]   But instead, he wrestles him,
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.560]   which means he just holds on to him.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.880]   Like, it doesn't say that he beats up God, right?
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.800]   Or God beats him up.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:52.760]   He fights with him.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.440]   He's against, he's holding on with all that he has.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.880]   It feels like it's in that moment, he's like,
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.600]   "God, if this is you, I have you.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.520]   "I have your attention, you have mine,
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.560]   "and I'm not gonna let you go."
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.000]   That is his wrestle.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.800]   It's a clinging on to God.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.200]   With his one chance, he stays, he wrestles.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.200]   He's got everything to lose, but Jacob clings to God.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.160]   A clear indicator of his transformation
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   in the middle of all of this is that Jacob then asks,
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.760]   what do I mean by this?
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.040]   Well, so far, Jacob has been really good at taking, right?
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.600]   He's been really good at being clever,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.480]   and whatever he thought was his,
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.080]   he would reach for it, he would take it.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.880]   Think specifically to the birthright situation.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.760]   There was a whole prophecy around how he would be the one
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.880]   who would get the inheritance.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.960]   But when things didn't go the way he thought,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.240]   when it looked challenging,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.160]   when it seemed like it was out of reach
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.560]   and God wasn't gonna do anything,
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.480]   he took it upon himself to get
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.080]   what he thought belonged to him.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.520]   So that would be the natural way
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.760]   that Jacob would engage in this space, but he asks.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.240]   He asks.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.520]   I think this is a big thing for a lot of us,
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.400]   because a lot of us live lives
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:16.240]   where we've got to take to get what we need.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.440]   No one's really looking out for us.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.920]   If I don't look out for me, who's gonna look out for me?
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.880]   And so we strive and we push and we take
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.680]   and we reach and we grab.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.600]   If there's an obstacle in front of me and what I need,
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.120]   I've got to figure out a way to get it.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.080]   We reach for whatever is around us.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.280]   This is the natural way that our city operates.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.560]   And this is the reality.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.880]   Getting the right things the wrong way
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.640]   will never actually satisfy you.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.840]   I mean, think about it.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.160]   Jacob already got the blessing.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.000]   Isaac actually blessed him.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.640]   Esau actually gave away his birthright.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.040]   He's already received the blessing.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.440]   What is he fighting for?
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.720]   He's received the blessing, but he's in a moment
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.520]   where he's terrified to go forward,
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.760]   where his whole world could be lost.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.040]   He's received the blessing,
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.680]   but he's petrified to move forward.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.920]   He has a wife and kids.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.520]   He has all the material things.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.400]   He's been blessed, but yet he's in the darkest,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.040]   most tense moment of his life.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.760]   He's taken rather than received.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.560]   And this is actually something that we can trace back
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.960]   to the beginning of scripture in Genesis.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.080]   We know that Adam and Eve, that the tree,
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.280]   the fruit on the tree looked desirable,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.280]   looked good for eating.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.440]   And when they are deceived, what do they do?
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.760]   Rather than going to the maker and asking him for it,
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.920]   they reach, they take for themselves.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.360]   They become their own gods.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.720]   And in doing that, they end up wrecking a relationship,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.480]   absolutely breaking the relationship with them
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.360]   and God.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.360]   So here's a crazy thought then.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.800]   Maybe the real blessing isn't the things we receive,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.560]   but maybe it's the relationship we open up
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.440]   with the one who gives the thing in the first place.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:05.280]   What if that's the whole thing?
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.720]   What if the true blessing is that relationship
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.680]   with the one who created it all,
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.000]   with the giver of the gift, not just the gift?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.920]   And I think what happens is when we reach,
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.960]   we bypass the giver and we get the stuff,
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.920]   or at least the best that we can reach for.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.200]   And I wonder how many times in our life
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.640]   God is planning to intervene, to meet us where we are,
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.600]   to show up, to give us what we need,
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.000]   but we end up taking matters into our own hands.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.080]   We end up filling our hands with the things
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.720]   that we can reach for, giving us absolutely no space
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.480]   to receive the thing he has for us.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.120]   We end up filling ourselves with these
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   lesser store brand blessings that really don't fulfill us
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.040]   in the first place.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.520]   We end up becoming our own heroes, our own God.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.200]   We settle for the beta version, not the true thing.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.680]   And Jacob in this moment has had enough of what he can do.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.000]   He's seen what his striving and what his reaching
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.080]   has done for him.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.680]   And it's not enough.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.200]   So he reaches this point and in this encounter,
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.880]   he asks for the blessing.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.080]   Slight difference.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.000]   He asks for the blessing versus taking the blessing.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.040]   And that changes everything.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.080]   I wonder what it would take for us
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.600]   to reach that point as well,
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.880]   where we recognize that actually,
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.080]   he says, "Knock, the door will be opened.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.760]   "Ask and you will receive."
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.480]   The father withholds no good gift from his children.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.440]   He actually says in scripture that if you wicked people
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.480]   can give your kids food and good gifts,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.280]   how much more am I gonna give you things?
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.360]   Later in the New Testament, it says that every good
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.960]   and perfect thing comes from the father above.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.760]   He is good and a giver of good stuff,
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.560]   but we're not gonna be able to see that.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.240]   We're not gonna be able to receive that
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.000]   if we've taken for ourselves the best of what we can grab,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.440]   the best of what we can do.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.960]   This was Jacob.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.720]   This was his dark moment, his lonely moment.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.440]   His encounter was so unorthodox,
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.640]   yet his healing was in his wrestle.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.280]   And like he should, like we should,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   he wrestles through the night till dawn and he prevails.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.640]   And what does it mean for him to prevail?
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.760]   It means that the old him has gone
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.720]   and a new version of him has come.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.360]   He is no longer Jacob the deceiver.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.200]   He is now Jacob the requester.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.440]   He's truly prevailed.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.460]   He has asked and God has blessed him.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.260]   This encounter has been successful.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.080]   God has met with him and he gets blessed,
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.680]   but I think there's a couple of details
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.840]   we need to really sit on before we continue.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.400]   His situation hasn't changed.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.160]   Has anyone noticed that yet?
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.760]   He meets with God as this awesome encounter,
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.140]   wrestles God, sees him face to face,
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.120]   but he still has a brother that might wanna kill him
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.840]   with 400 men.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.320]   And his encounter with God didn't come
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.120]   with 400 mercenary angels ready to fight on his behalf.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.740]   It didn't come with extra strength to be able to fight.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.820]   Actually, let's see, what does this encounter
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.660]   actually produce?
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.120]   It says, "Your name shall no longer be called Jacob,
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.060]   "but Israel, for you have striven with God
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.600]   "and with men and you've prevailed."
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.800]   So in his asking of God, in his big encounter moment,
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.080]   he's finally done it all right.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.200]   And what does he get?
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.480]   A limp and a new name.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.520]   Take that to the battle.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.720]   How does that even work?
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.600]   Think about this.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.040]   It wasn't until Jethro pointed it out
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.520]   in our conversation about it.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.440]   So this is his point, not mine.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.480]   Jacob is now more vulnerable because he met with God.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.280]   He actually can't defend himself.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.440]   See, sometimes we think if we just pray,
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.240]   we're gonna have all the strength to do everything
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.600]   and we're just gonna have these results happen overnight.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.240]   What happens when you pray
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.520]   and somehow you're more vulnerable afterwards?
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.900]   Have you ever felt that way?
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.320]   Where you poured out your heart to God
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.240]   and your situation hasn't changed immediately?
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.600]   Maybe you've walked away with a spiritual limp.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.780]   God gives him a limp and a new name.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.080]   But here's the thing.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.900]   The blessing from his encounter with God
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.000]   is gonna be for who Jacob is at the core.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.520]   God blesses him by changing not just his name,
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.440]   but now his identity.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.760]   If you remember what I said earlier in this sermon,
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.720]   the name is so important.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.560]   The name speaks to who you are.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.800]   It speaks to what you're gonna do.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.280]   It speaks to what you have done.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.520]   It is, in essence, your identity.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.160]   The whole of you can be wrapped up in your name.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.040]   And so now after experiencing and encountering God
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.360]   in this way, he's no longer Jacob the trickster,
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.680]   no longer Jacob the supplant or the heel grabber,
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.720]   the one who tries to cheat to get ahead.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.560]   He is now Israel, the one who fought and wrestled with God
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.400]   and has been changed and prevailed.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.200]   God, in essence, has changed the entirety of who Jacob is.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.000]   God renames him something from their encounter,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.960]   but something for his future.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.680]   Jacob is able to enter this same challenging
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.040]   and hard and tense and broken situation,
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.240]   all the same that it was,
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.760]   but as a completely different person
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.340]   with a completely new identity,
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.880]   having seen the face of God, put it this way,
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.160]   the situation didn't change, but the person did.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.720]   The situation didn't change, but the person did.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.880]   And this had to have an effect on his perspective.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.080]   He had to look at his moment a bit differently now.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.040]   He's walking with this limp, yes, but with this swagger
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.160]   'cause he's just seen God, he's just wrestled with God,
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.520]   he's just had the source of all good things with him.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.560]   He has struggled with him.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.600]   And all of a sudden, yes, Esau's still there with 400 men,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   but perhaps he's not longer gripped in fear of his brother.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.560]   Perhaps there's a slight easing,
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.280]   a confidence that has come because you were with God,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.160]   because you were in his presence,
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.640]   because you spent time with him,
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.600]   wrestling and contending him.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   Looking now at the situation completely different,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Jacob can no longer lean on his own strength.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.200]   He literally has to lean on God's ability.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.280]   He literally has to lean on God's strength.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.760]   And the story goes well.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.880]   Jacob ends up going, seeing his brother,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.840]   and his brother's happy to see him.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.160]   That's great.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.000]   That's awesome.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.040]   That's a great, happy conclusion to our story.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.400]   But before we got there,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.440]   before we reached a happy conclusion,
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.120]   Jacob is changed and now has a new approach
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.280]   with no promises, simply based off
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.120]   of his encounter with God.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.920]   This encounter exists to show us something
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.320]   of what an encounter of God can do in us and for us.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.880]   How it can change us at our core.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.560]   How it can bring about a divine confidence,
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.760]   reposition who we are,
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.120]   helping us learn how to lean on his strength
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.160]   in times of trouble.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   What we find, we find that we must be a people
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.200]   who do two things, who pray and the people who wait.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.680]   I'm gonna boil everything down to those two things.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.960]   The people who pray and the people who wait.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.200]   These two things are essential.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.000]   Jacob's encounter only comes after he prays.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.520]   Prayer opened the door.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.120]   I love that he prays early in the night,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.520]   but the encounter doesn't come till later in the night.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.200]   Prayer was his pregame.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.040]   It was his way of opening the channel,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.120]   posturing and positioning himself
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.000]   to be able to have that encounter,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.240]   that unexpected meeting with God
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.720]   that produced unexpected results.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.240]   Honest prayer is where you thank God, yes,
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.960]   but you also pour out your heart to God
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.800]   and you don't try to over-spiritualize it.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.440]   You don't try to use the big words.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.640]   You don't try to use Greek and Hebrew.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.760]   You just tell him where you are.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.800]   That kind of prayer is essential.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.420]   This kind of prayer is what God wants for us, not from us,
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.000]   because in that it fuels,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.320]   it gives depth to our intimacy with him.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.560]   We spend time with him, we get to know him.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.760]   And it requires that we trust that God hears us
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.000]   and that God will never leave us alone.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.960]   It's not our battles to fight on our own.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.120]   And the second thing, Jacob prays, nothing happens,
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.720]   but Jacob waits and something begins.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.640]   This is probably the thing you gotta write down
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.960]   and keep for this week, all right?
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.400]   I think we've got to learn how to do this
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.220]   because we live in a society and a generation
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.600]   in a world of instant gratification.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.480]   We don't have to wait for anything, right?
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.720]   Like everything is kind of quick.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.360]   Everything, whatever we need, it's there.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.120]   Life is like instant noodles, just really, really quick.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.040]   Get what you need, get it really quick.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.520]   And if we live this way in every aspect of our lives,
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:57.760]   we potentially take this way of thinking
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.080]   into our spiritual lives.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.800]   So when we go to God, when we actually dare
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.680]   to have the courage to pray and be honest,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.660]   we don't have the discipline to wait for his response.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.460]   We potentially don't have the discipline to wait
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.000]   for his rescue, for his encounter.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.760]   Oftentimes that waiting is a wrestling
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.680]   through the feelings, a wrestling through the silence,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.040]   a wrestling with your doubts,
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.440]   a wrestling through the whole night,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.160]   as we see here in Jacob's story,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.920]   to stay and to contend with God.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.120]   Jacob's desperation is what fuels his wrestling.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.600]   My question is, are we desperate enough
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.480]   to where if we get in that moment,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   we will not let him go?
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.920]   I think we've got this weird concept as a society,
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   as a Christian society, that everything is formulaic.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.640]   And what I mean by that is a lot of times
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.440]   we have these specific things that we do.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.140]   You wake up and have a five minute prayer
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.640]   and then you go about your day.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.440]   Or every January, we do a 21 day fast.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.640]   Nothing against fasting for 21 days, that's great.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.480]   I do it too.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.980]   But we have our 21 day fast and then we go on.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.160]   But here's my question.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.980]   What happens if it's not the formula?
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.760]   What happens if God is planning on meeting you
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.900]   on the 22nd day?
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:24.740]   What happens if God plans on meeting you
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.520]   minute six of your devotion?
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.120]   Sorry God, only five minutes today.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.760]   See, we've gotten this whole idea of quick, easy
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   and formula mixed together and ends up happening
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.440]   is that we put forth the effort, but we don't wait.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.600]   We don't slow down enough to wait for him.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.080]   So then we end up missing him.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.600]   And not just missing him, we end up going
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.400]   and figuring it out ourselves.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.040]   We end up, okay, well God hasn't shown up,
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.640]   so let me figure out how I can do.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.760]   Jacob did the same thing.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.640]   God hasn't shown up, what can I do?
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.400]   I'll send these gifts, I'll send my kids ahead,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.240]   I'll send this, doing all these things.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.320]   We end up filling our hands with what we can grab
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.460]   with our strategies, with our own way of doing things
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.720]   and we end up missing what it is that God has for us.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.700]   What if we fasted for 22 days?
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.320]   What if, actually I have time, Emma told me this
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.360]   when we were studying this passage.
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.720]   The 21 day fast, the Daniel fast,
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.400]   is something that we set up looking back on it.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.600]   Daniel didn't set out saying,
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.960]   I'm only gonna fast for 21 days.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.120]   Think about that.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.400]   His fast was until something happens.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.920]   So we look back on it and we're like, all right, 21 days.
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.120]   But actually, this is not about the fast,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.000]   this is about us in general.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.320]   It's not the formula, you've got to wait.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.220]   We've got to wait.
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:44.480]   We've got to wrestle and wait on the Lord.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.420]   That's where we will renew our strength,
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.900]   that's where we will find our hope,
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.320]   that's when we'll rise on wings like eagles and soar
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.100]   when we wait on the Lord.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:58.980]   The temptation of not waiting on the Lord
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.040]   means that we enter into this headspace
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.100]   that we have to take care of ourselves.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.040]   I was touched on it earlier,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.240]   but it's something we have to remind ourselves.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.840]   It's not just up to you to get you through.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.440]   Hear this, you're not the only one that cares about you.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.280]   That's good to know, right?
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.200]   There's someone who cares about you significantly more
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.760]   in every possible way to the fullest extent,
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.840]   holistically cares about you.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.080]   Our world and our lives are not solely dependent
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.600]   on what we can do and what we make of it.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.440]   The Christian story is this,
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.680]   that we have abdicated the rights to be our own gods
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.880]   and we've given that responsibility
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.640]   to the only true God in Jesus.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.640]   And hear this, he cares for you.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.880]   So could we live like that?
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.040]   Could we wait on him?
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.080]   Could we wait on God?
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.360]   Could we wait on the Lord through the night,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.920]   through the tension, through the anxiety,
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.760]   through the stress?
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.400]   Could we wait on the Lord?
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.880]   Could we wait for those moments
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.200]   where we finally have his attention
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.440]   and when we have his attention,
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.720]   could we hold onto him?
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.680]   Could we grab him?
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.640]   Could we say, I'm not letting you go until you bless me?
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.120]   Could we posture ourselves to ask and not reach and grab?
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.600]   Could we hold onto him?
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:18.000]   Could we choose to not avoid or hide?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Could we wrestle for more than just a feeling?
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.080]   Could we wrestle for all that he has for us?
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.120]   Can we put our future back in his hands
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.120]   where everything is possible
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.960]   versus our hands where only so much can be achieved?
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.480]   Can we put it in the hands of him who has no limits?
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.640]   He operates in the impossible.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.360]   That's the guy I want in the driver's seat of my life.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.600]   So don't take for yourself what you find.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.040]   Leave it to God to give you what he has.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.160]   I grew up hearing this song,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.960]   I think I was around maybe between the ages of seven and 10.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.160]   My mom used to sing in the choir,
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.280]   which is where I get my ability to sing from.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.840]   And I remember going to choir practices on Monday
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.520]   and there's this one song they would sing.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.600]   It was, you're an on time God, yes he is.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   And it's like, he's an on time God, yes he is.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.720]   And the words are, he may not come when you want him,
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.800]   but he'll be there right on time.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.200]   He's an on time God, yes he is.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.560]   Church, this is my appeal, that we've got to wait.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.280]   It may feel like God just should have come five minutes ago,
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.680]   he should have been here three weeks ago,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.080]   he should have been here before this challenge happens,
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.440]   but he is an on time God.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.960]   And he may not come when you think he should be there.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.880]   He may not do it the way that you want him to do it,
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.520]   but that's the whole point of these encounters,
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.520]   it's unexpected, it happens in unexpected ways.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.080]   But if we will position ourselves,
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.200]   if we will posture ourselves to receive it
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.080]   through praying and through waiting,
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   he does not disappoint.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.960]   He will not leave you alone.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.760]   He will not leave you to only your strength.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.800]   Wait on the Lord, wait through the night,
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.840]   wait through the silence, hold on to him.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:11.800]   Waiting is hard.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.320]   Not gonna pretend like it's something you can theorize.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.040]   If it wasn't hard, we'd all do it.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:22.880]   But I pray that by understanding this encounter,
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.880]   that it would produce something in you.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:31.000]   That your desperation to encounter, to know,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.960]   to experience that same God
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.360]   would fuel your discipline to wait.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360]   I pray that the Holy Spirit
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.760]   will give you the strength you need.
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.640]   I pray that he will help and guide you,
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.720]   that he will light your path and lead you forward,
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.080]   that he will clear your mind,
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.960]   that he will remind you of what is in front of you.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.000]   And that is a God who cares, a God who loves,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.720]   a God who desires the absolute best for you,
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.320]   a God who loves you more than you can love yourself,
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.040]   and a God who's more capable than what we're capable of.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.400]   And so Jesus, we come before you this morning asking,
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:15.240]   asking, not reaching, but asking for your help.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.720]   God, would you teach us how to pray?
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.480]   Would you teach us how to be honest in front of you?
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.560]   How to bear our souls in front of you?
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.280]   Would you give us the confidence and the trust to know
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.520]   that you hear us when we pray
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.160]   and that you care about the dialogue,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   about the channel of communication that it opens?
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.720]   Would you remind us that by just being in your presence,
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.560]   we are changed?
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:43.360]   Would you remind us that by just being around you,
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.000]   we are shaped and molded differently?
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.760]   That these encounters are not limited to the holy
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.560]   and to the saints, but it's also to the sinners like us.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.720]   Would you make us the people who pray?
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.240]   And Holy Spirit, would you also be what sustains us?
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.560]   Because starting can be easy, but staying can be hard.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.800]   So God, would you, through the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.480]   sustain us in waiting for you, waiting on the Lord,
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.480]   waiting and renewing our mind
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.200]   and that you would renew our strength,
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.960]   that you would be what we need if we wait on you,
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.440]   that we will find joy again if we wait on you.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.120]   (gentle music)
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:33.320]   That surely we will see you and your goodness
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.200]   if we were to wait on you.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.000]   So Holy Spirit, sustain us,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.600]   give us the strength that we need to stay,
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.160]   give us the discipline, the reminders that we need to stay,
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.680]   to rely and to wait,
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.280]   knowing that you're not gonna let us down.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.120]   You've never let us down before.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.600]   You've been faithful 100% of the time.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:03.440]   And so we lean on that faithful God this morning.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.960]   In Jesus' name, amen.
