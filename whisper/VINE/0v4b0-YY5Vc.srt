1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
 I asked him what were the things on his heart, what were the things that he was looking forward

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,960
 to in life.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,720
 And he told me about a new film that he was really excited for.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,520
 He told me about a book he was wanting to write.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,680
 He told me about how he was longing to come back to Hong Kong and be here at the Vine

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,520
 and share a testimony of his heart for us as a church.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,800
 And it really stings that he's not here anymore.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,600
 And I know many of you are mourning as we step into 2021 for him.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,040
 Josh loved the Vine.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,760
 The Vine was his church for 20 years.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
 It was a part of his community.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,920
 It was the only church that he knew in his adult life.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,720
 And it was a place of comfort for him.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,480
 He sat through countless numbers of my sermons over the years.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,760
 I kind of feel sorry for the guy, so many sermons.

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,200
 And he sat there and he was always the loudest amen for me.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,600
 I mean even in the days when I had off days, he would still be the loudest amen cheering

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,720
 me on.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,200
 You know, he told me recently that he was grateful for his cancer.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,960
 I know that sounds like a very strange thing to say, but Josh understood what it was that

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,400
 the cancer was doing in him.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,040
 He understood the seriousness of it.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,320
 He knew that it was bringing him to a place where his life was under threat.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,560
 He understood that.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,960
 But Josh never had time for the idea of thinking about dying.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,000
 Josh's whole life and his whole legacy he leaves is the idea of what it is to live,

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,140
 to be full of life.

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:53,200
 Josh walked into the worst moments of his life in his last two years of his battle with cancer.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,480
 And he did so with a huge amount of life on his heart.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,240
 He was constantly telling me, challenging me, asking me about how I was growing in my

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,800
 life as I saw him grow so much in his life.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,520
 He would look at himself and he would say, "Hey, cancer is a part of my reality, but

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,840
 it is not my identity."

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
 Josh never allowed himself to wallow in any place of self-pity.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,200
 He never looked for the people around him to kind of pity him or walk with him.

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,960
 Josh always raised the bar of hope.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,600
 He always raised the bar of positivity in conversations that he had with him.

38
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,320
 I know even in the last couple of months when he was in great pain, I still would leave

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,080
 a conversation with him feeling better about myself.

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,960
 And he had this idea that his greatest amount of growth and his greatest amount of change

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,040
 could actually happen in the hardest moments of his life.

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,560
 And like I say, I knew him for 25 years and I can testify that his growth as a person

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,880
 in the last number of months before he passed away was some of the most tremendous I'd seen.

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,360
 He was always the most positive, the most kindest person I think I've ever met.

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,900
 But even in the last few months of his life, that just increased even more.

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,360
 And he would speak constantly to me of the ways in which he felt healed.

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,000
 In fact, to be honest with you, if Josh was standing with me right here in this moment,

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,480
 I think he would look in the camera and he would say that cancer healed him.

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,500
 Even though we know that cancer took his life, he would tell you that cancer healed him.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,300
 Because for Josh, healing was so much more than just what happens to your physical body.

51
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,640
 Healing for him was about your emotions.

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,560
 It was about your psychology.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,320
 It was about your relationships.

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,680
 It was about your spiritual life.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,040
 And he would testify to you right now that through cancer and through all the struggle

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,760
 that he had in the last few months of his life and all the suffering that I saw that

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,960
 he went through, he felt like he was in the greatest place of his relationships, the greatest

58
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,340
 place of his marriage with Chelsea, the greatest place as a father to Emery, the greatest place

59
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,000
 of his relationships with his friends around him.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,280
 He felt like he had grown and changed in his person more than ever.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
 He had become more forgiving.

62
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,400
 He had been released of some of the stuff that he'd been carrying in his life.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,320
 He had been able to put himself in a place where he was at peace with who he is in a

64
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,760
 way that I had never seen before.

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,320
 And then that was particularly true about his relationship with Jesus.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,200
 You know, one of the things that I celebrate today as I stand before you with all the emotions

67
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,680
 that I'm carrying is where he was in his relationship with Jesus before he passed.

68
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,000
 I mean, he'd always had a strong relationship with God.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
 That had been something that was so important to Josh all of his life.

70
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,600
 And I'd had the great privilege of journeying with him in his 20s and 30s and seeing that

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,080
 relationship grow.

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,760
 But in the last few months, that relationship went to a whole nother level.

73
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,320
 I would love his WhatsApps and his voice messages in the middle of the night, particularly when

74
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 he was in Mexico.

75
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,920
 He'd send them and I'd wake up in the morning and they would be overnight.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,480
 And he would tell me about how excited he was about Jesus.

77
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,280
 He would share something with me in like a little voicemail about what Jesus had said

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,040
 to him that day about how he was growing in his relationship.

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,360
 I saw an intimacy with Josh and Jesus that I had never seen before in any other time

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
 in his life.

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,640
 It was in his greatest moments of trauma and hardship and suffering that Josh was propelled,

82
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,320
 was catalyzed into his greatest moments of his relationship with Jesus.

83
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,480
 Where I think in that much suffering, I would have probably distanced myself from God.

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,040
 Josh became closer and more intimate to his Savior.

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,960
 He flourished in a place where things were really difficult.

86
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
 That didn't mean it was always easy for him.

87
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
 It didn't mean that things were really light and fluffy the whole time.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,320
 I knew the depth of the pain and the hardship that he was going through.

89
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,040
 And yet he always chose life.

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,720
 He always chose to challenge himself and to grow.

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,280
 And where I may have backed away and been bitter, he pressed in and became more intimate

92
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
 to Jesus.

93
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,440
 And today, church, we're standing right here at the start of 2021.

94
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,360
 We're standing literally in a new season, in a new moment, in a new year.

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,980
 And I think we stand at a crossroads where we have now a decision to make.

96
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,600
 It's a decision that I think Josh's life brings us to.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,320
 It's a decision that I think his legacy leaves behind for us and challenges us with.

98
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:36,640
 And the decision is this, that we would consciously allow our negative experience to spur positive

99
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,920
 change.

100
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,480
 That we as a church and that we as individuals would allow the hardships, the hard times,

101
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,000
 the struggles to actually not bring us into the worst case scenario of thinking, to not

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 hold us back and to weigh us down, but actually to propel us into the greatest moments of

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,140
 our humanity, propel us into the greatest moments of our growth and make us more intimate

104
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,040
 with Jesus than we have ever been before.

105
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,720
 I think we have an opportunity right here at the start of the year to honor the legacy

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,040
 that Josh leaves behind by saying to ourselves, are we going to allow 2020 and all of the

107
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,440
 stuff that we've been through to move us into this year with some grave clothes around us?

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,400
 Or are we going to step into this year in new life and faith and hope, believing that

109
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,280
 2021 could be our greatest moment of intimacy with the people in our lives and with the

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
 people of Jesus?

111
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,880
 Look, 2021 has been a hard year for all of us.

112
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,800
 Sorry, 2020 has been a hard year for all of us.

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,520
 It's been a difficult time.

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,520
 Many of you watching this, you've lost people in the last year.

115
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,160
 You've lost loved ones, maybe to COVID or to other things, and you're not being able

116
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,320
 to travel to go and be with them at that time.

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,800
 There's been this global pandemic that has shut us all down and kind of locked us all

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
 away at times.

119
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,440
 There's been an economic disaster upon this world.

120
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,040
 Many of you have lost jobs and there have been small businesses that have been closed

121
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,280
 throughout our city.

122
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,600
 And I also want to say that here in Hong Kong, alongside of this pandemic and everything

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,360
 there, there's also been a shift and a change in the politics of our city.

124
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,680
 There's been a change in the things that have happened in our society that we're all still

125
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,080
 trying to walk through and work through, and that's still having an impact on each one

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,040
 of us.

127
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,840
 Every single one of us, we faced such a challenging year.

128
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,080
 And as we step now into 2021, we'd be forgiven for feeling a little bit timid, right?

129
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,720
 There's still quite a lot of uncertainty ahead for us.

130
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,480
 We don't know exactly what's going to happen with this virus.

131
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,120
 We don't know whether this vaccine is going to be perfect and suddenly set everything

132
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
 right.

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,840
 We don't know when we're going to be able to travel again.

134
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,680
 If you've lost your job, you're probably wondering, "When am I going to find employment again?"

135
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,680
 There's a lot of things that are still uncertain and unknown, and we'd be forgiven for stepping

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,640
 into this year with a bit of fear in us, with a bit of timidity, with a bit of wondering

137
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,980
 what's ahead, with not excitement, but actually a heaviness to us.

138
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,440
 We would be forgiven for feeling that way.

139
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,880
 But I want to stand before you right now and say, "I think we've got another choice.

140
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,440
 I think that we could actually start this year and be inspired by someone like Josh,

141
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,560
 that we can start this year no matter what we have been through, no matter what we have

142
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
 been."

143
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,920
 I'm not downplaying what you have been through.

144
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,080
 I've been through a lot in the last year myself, but I'm going to make a commitment to start

145
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,040
 this year facing forwards, looking forward to the things that I believe God can do in

146
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,760
 me, because if His resurrection spirit is in me, then I believe that He can bring me

147
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,720
 out of my grave clothes into new life.

148
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:49,160
 I wonder whether that's also what you might be feeling as you step now into this new year.

149
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,760
 You see, as we step into 2021, we can either do so with hope or with fear.

150
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,520
 We can do so in death or in life.

151
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,840
 The decision, I believe, rests with us.

152
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,880
 I want to invite you into a new season of life today as we start this new series.

153
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,440
 A few months ago, a friend of mine sent me an article from a counseling magazine, and

154
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,080
 the article was all about this idea of something that I had never heard of.

155
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,040
 It was called post-traumatic growth.

156
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,240
 Now we've all heard about post-traumatic stress.

157
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
 We all know what that is, that when we go through a trauma or a hard time, that the

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,320
 stress of that, the anxiety of that, the fear of that can impact us for the many years ahead.

159
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,840
 This article spoke about the other side of trauma.

160
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,760
 This was first discovered back in the '90s, but the research has grown and it's become

161
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,920
 more prominent in the last number of years.

162
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,760
 The idea that actually there's this other thing, this post-traumatic growth, that our

163
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,320
 traumas, that our hard times, the hardships that we face and that we go through could

164
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,920
 actually be a catalyst to the greatest moments of our growth and our change.

165
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:08,120
 The article actually describes post-traumatic growth like this, positive life experience

166
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:16,400
 that is the result of adversity or other challenges that gives rise to a higher level of functioning,

167
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,000
 a higher level of awareness in us.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
 And here's the thing that I thought was amazing about this article.

169
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,400
 It said that in the people that they studied who had gone through some great trauma and

170
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,200
 yet had come out of it in a place of growth and change, the article said that the depth

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,040
 of that growth and change was of such a high level that there's no way it would have been

172
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,080
 possible unless they had gone through that trauma in the first place.

173
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,200
 In other words, the trauma was the catalyst to a level of growth they never would have

174
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,000
 experienced unless they would have faced that thing they had to go through.

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,120
 And I know, I don't know about you, but when I go through trauma or hard times, my tendency

176
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,320
 is to want to try to ignore it or avoid it or push it away.

177
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,120
 The research has said that actually the way we grow through trauma is not by pushing it

178
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,520
 or ignoring it or trying to avoid it, but actually staring it face to face, by actually

179
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,800
 learning what it is to embrace it, to understand it.

180
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,040
 Doesn't mean you have to like it or welcome it, but sit in the reality of that trauma

181
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
 in your life.

182
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:29,560
 And as you embrace the emotions of it, don't try to fight them as you're real and honest

183
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
 with them.

184
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,980
 From there, you can begin to look forward to the things that the trauma might produce

185
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,960
 and create in you.

186
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,360
 It is exactly this that I saw Josh do.

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,080
 He was able to face those hard things that were going on around him and not make those

188
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,980
 so much a part of his identity that they began to shape his thinking, but actually use those

189
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,640
 things to propel him into something that was even greater.

190
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,320
 What we're going to do in this series is we're going to look over the next six weeks at what

191
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,280
 post-traumatic growth is all about.

192
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,000
 And in this series, I want to bring together both psychology, the way we think and act

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,280
 in our emotions in our humanity, and theology and the Spirit of God and the work of the

194
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,600
 divine amongst us.

195
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,200
 My prayer over the next six weeks is that you'll be able to actually start 2021 with

196
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,360
 a change in the way that you think, a mindset shift that brings you into the place of actually

197
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,540
 your greatest moments of growth.

198
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,600
 In the article, it says that post-traumatic growth happens most in five prominent areas.

199
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,640
 And it's these five areas that we're going to be looking at over the coming weeks in

200
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
 this series.

201
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,780
 The first area is just this appreciation for life.

202
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,160
 The second area is the idea of our relationships with one another and how those grow and change.

203
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,480
 The third area is new possibilities of life, like what I want to do new now as I emerge

204
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,160
 out of this trauma that I've experienced.

205
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,320
 The fourth is this idea of personal strength.

206
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,560
 How have I grown?

207
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,960
 How have I become stronger through this time?

208
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,480
 And then finally, the idea, and I think this is really interesting because the article

209
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,600
 was from a secular publication, but it spoke about the fifth thing they saw in people,

210
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,360
 and that was the deepening of spiritual change.

211
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,680
 So there was a spiritual shift for people.

212
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,480
 And so what we're going to do in this series is we're going to take a look at those five

213
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,480
 things, but not through the eyes of what a journal article tells us, but through the

214
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,200
 eyes of what the Gospels show to us.

215
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,520
 We're going to go to the life of Jesus, and in each of the weeks, we're going to take

216
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,200
 a story of Jesus that speaks to one of these ideas of post-traumatic growth.

217
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,920
 Look, Jesus spent his whole time dealing with people in trauma, people that were either

218
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,000
 in trauma, going through it, or coming out of it.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
 And Jesus met people right where they were at, whether they were demon-possessed, whether

220
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,520
 they were poor, whether they were under some affliction from disease, whether they were

221
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,520
 afraid or under the oppression of an empire or a community around them, whatever it might

222
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
 be.

223
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,920
 Jesus met people in the places of their struggle and their trial and their trauma, and in those

224
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,060
 places, he brought them life.

225
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,120
 He helped them to understand the way to see the world differently.

226
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,600
 The kingdom of God came alive to them.

227
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,380
 And my prayer is we go through these different stories over the coming weeks, you'll also

228
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,240
 begin to shift your thinking and your prayers and your expectations for everything that's

229
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,040
 ahead of you in 2021.

230
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:31,640
 I believe that as you see Jesus turn trauma into change, into transformation, you're going

231
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,920
 to be inspired to ask him to come and do the same for you.

232
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,320
 You know, one of the things that we want to make sure we're emphasizing in 2021 here at

233
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,120
 The Vine is not just what happens here on Church Everywhere on Sundays.

234
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,840
 As much as we love to gather like this and we'll continue to do that, we realize that

235
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,960
 discipleship happens in many other formats than just this one that I'm doing right now

236
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,560
 in preaching to you.

237
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,320
 And so for this series, we want this idea of post-traumatic growth to go wider for you

238
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,880
 and to be in a variety of ways that you can think about it and absorb it in your own discipleship.

239
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,800
 So as well as just the sermon series on a Sunday, there are three other particular ways

240
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,680
 we want you to get a hold of this idea and perhaps to grow in this area for you.

241
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,840
 The first, as we've talked about already and Pastor Ellison shared at the beginning of

242
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:25,840
 our services, is the 21-day devotional series that's coming up just starting on Monday,

243
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,360
 the 11th of January.

244
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,920
 The actual devotional series begins on the 10th because I'm going to put out an intro

245
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,600
 to the series on that day.

246
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,360
 And then for 21 days from the Monday, we're having a devotion from somebody in The Vine

247
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,720
 community who has actually experienced trauma in their lives, gone through something really

248
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
 hard and really difficult, and has grown out of that.

249
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,560
 And those devotionals are a daily testimony to the power of a God to change us and to

250
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,240
 grow us in the mix of the worst moments of life.

251
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,480
 And there are stories about people who have lost loved ones, stories of people who have

252
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,900
 lost their work, stories of people that have had to leave Hong Kong, stories that really

253
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,120
 are challenging and deep, but actually bring great inspiration as they have met and discovered

254
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,320
 Christ in them.

255
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,960
 So I pray that those devotionals will be a great way for you to deepen your personal

256
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,040
 discipleship in this idea of post-traumatic growth.

257
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,840
 Alongside of that, we're going to be running a couple of courses in February so that you

258
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,080
 can take the teaching of this series to a much deeper level.

259
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:28,720
 The first course is called Transforming Trauma, and that's going to start on February the

260
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
 6th.

261
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 That's a Saturday.

262
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,560
 And it's going to be run by our Chinese community here at The Vine.

263
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,160
 It's going to be available for absolutely everybody.

264
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
 And it's going to be a four-week course that takes you through how it is that you can practically

265
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,560
 transform trauma in your life.

266
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,720
 It's going to look at the emotions of trauma, the processing of trauma, as well as the ability

267
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,680
 to then walk beyond it into something new.

268
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,560
 So that's Transforming Trauma.

269
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:59,120
 Now after that, starting on Saturday the 20th of February, we're going to have Healing Trauma.

270
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,320
 And Healing Trauma is another course designed to actually practically pray with you and

271
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,200
 walk with you spiritually in the healing of your own traumatic experiences.

272
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,040
 And so where Transforming Trauma will bring a thinking and a reflection and a biblical

273
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,840
 study around trauma, Healing Trauma is going to be more practical, hands-on prayer and

274
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,920
 ministry for you as you come out of a place of trauma in your life.

275
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,320
 And we're so excited that we can provide both that theory and that study and the biblical

276
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,440
 basis but also come around you, lay hands, and pray for you and see you delivered into

277
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
 the best year that you can.

278
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,600
 And the third thing is that I've just recently put out a personal podcast called A Broken

279
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
 Hallelujah.

280
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,020
 And A Broken Hallelujah is all based around this idea of post-traumatic growth.

281
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,320
 And in the podcast, what I do twice a month is I interview somebody from around the world

282
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,520
 who's gone through some crazy hard experience and yet has met God, who has wrestled with

283
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,160
 God and walked away with a bit of a limp.

284
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,840
 And we look at those stories.

285
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,680
 And the reason why I'm mentioning this to you guys today is that the very first episode

286
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,880
 is actually a conversation I had just a few weeks ago with Josh.

287
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,360
 And in that conversation, Josh talks all about the ways in which he has grown through his

288
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,960
 cancer journey.

289
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,440
 It's a beautiful conversation.

290
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,200
 It's incredibly challenging and yet so hopeful.

291
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,960
 And I want to really encourage you.

292
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,520
 I can't stand here and tell you about his growth.

293
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,040
 I want you to hear him tell you about his growth.

294
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,160
 I want him to tell his story.

295
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,840
 So that's the first episode of the podcast.

296
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,520
 You can go to Spotify or you can go to Apple Podcasts.

297
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,080
 Just type in A Broken Hallelujah.

298
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,980
 You'll find it and you can hear Josh tell you his story of growth through trauma.

299
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,640
 And our prayer is that through all of those things, you'll be able to be deeply discipled

300
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,840
 in this change for you as you step into the new year.

301
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,280
 Now I know that as we do begin this new year, we're all carrying stuff with us from 2020.

302
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,760
 We've already talked about this.

303
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,400
 We felt it in our worship time.

304
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,000
 I want to lay a foundation to growing out of trauma today by focusing a little bit on

305
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,040
 the things that we might be carrying into this new year.

306
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,080
 I want you to take a moment just to think about what it is that you are carrying.

307
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,840
 And let me be honest with you about a few of the things that I feel I'm carrying in

308
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,240
 my spirit as I'm stepping into this new year.

309
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,880
 I think I'm carrying anger, grief, and hurt.

310
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,400
 I'm angry at what happened with Josh and I stand in solidarity and anger on behalf of

311
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,720
 Chelsea and Emery as they face their future of uncertainty at this time.

312
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,120
 And that really upsets me.

313
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,680
 I'm carrying this latent sense of anger at God for all that's taken place and for the

314
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,600
 loss that I'm feeling.

315
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,380
 I'm also sensing grief.

316
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,560
 Of course grief for Josh and that, but also actually, and I want to say this, I'm carrying

317
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,360
 a sense of grief for our city, for Hong Kong.

318
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,880
 And I don't know about you, but the changes that I've seen in the last six months have

319
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,760
 been very difficult to see.

320
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,360
 And I'm walking into a place where I'm grieving something for our city.

321
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,000
 I'm grieving something for the people of Hong Kong.

322
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,200
 And that's something that I feel very much on my spirit as I step into the new year.

323
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,800
 The other thing I'm feeling is hurt.

324
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,940
 Last year, 2020, was probably the hardest year of leadership for me.

325
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,200
 It's not easy to lead a church community in a time of crisis.

326
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,480
 It is exciting because you get to see God act and move in crisis in beautiful ways.

327
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,320
 The church always grows the best in a place of struggle or trial or suffering.

328
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,780
 And we definitely saw that in 2020.

329
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,700
 But on a personal level, it was quite difficult.

330
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,700
 I had a number of times in the year where I made decisions for us as a church where

331
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,500
 I came under strong personal criticism.

332
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,900
 And I have to be honest, that hurt.

333
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
 And I've had to process some of that, and I'm still processing it.

334
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,540
 And I feel that hurt on me a little bit as I still step now into 21.

335
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,300
 I'm sure you're carrying some things on you.

336
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,140
 And because I'm carrying these things, I know the theory of post-traumatic growth, but the

337
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,940
 idea of getting there, the idea of shifting towards it still feels a little bit scary

338
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
 for me.

339
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,040
 I'm still a little bit skeptical if I'm honest, if I could really grow through the hard times

340
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 that I face.

341
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,420
 And maybe that's also how you're feeling in this moment as well.

342
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:26,220
 Well, if so, I want to talk to you just for a few moments about wounds and scars.

343
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,440
 Wounds and scars are interesting.

344
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,100
 They're actually very different, although they come together in a similar way.

345
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,300
 Let me explain.

346
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,260
 Wounds and scars are formed out of a place of trauma, out of a place of suffering.

347
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,100
 Wounds and scars are things that we all experience.

348
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,740
 And they're physical when we've had some sort of suffering that is a physical thing, but

349
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,940
 they can also be emotional or psychological or even spiritual.

350
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,100
 But they are also distinctly different.

351
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,660
 Let me explain this.

352
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,520
 Wounds are what happens to us in the moment of suffering.

353
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,220
 Wounds are what take place when we are afflicted by something and they hurt.

354
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,540
 There's pain there.

355
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,220
 They are open wounds before us.

356
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,440
 And our wounds stay with us during a healing process.

357
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,120
 The wounds begin to take time to go from that place of openness and hurt and pain to a place

358
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
 of healing.

359
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,220
 And in that process, the wounds still hurt.

360
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,540
 When we carry wounds with us, we are carrying with us that sense of that anxiety and that

361
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,000
 vulnerability.

362
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,720
 Our wounds, because they're open and they're bleeding and there's pain there, we want to

363
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,440
 cover them and they create this vulnerability in us.

364
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,480
 Scars are very different.

365
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,900
 Scars are wounds that have healed.

366
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,860
 Scars if you will, are the things that remain after the healing process has been completed

367
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,540
 from a wound.

368
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,700
 Scars are the very things that actually say to us that the wound did not survive, that

369
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,560
 the wound was not the thing that had the victory.

370
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,900
 The scar is the proof, even though sometimes they're quite ugly, they're the beautiful

371
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,380
 proof that the wound did not win.

372
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,940
 Our scars are the things that we carry with us that tell two sides to a story.

373
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,460
 You see, wounds only tell one story.

374
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,940
 They tell the story of pain.

375
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,220
 But scars tell two stories.

376
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:29,880
 The scar on you shows you that there was a moment of wound, a moment of pain, a moment

377
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,700
 of suffering, but the scar also tells the more powerful story of your healing.

378
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:45,140
 See, I think in the story of life, our scars make healing more central than the hurting.

379
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,940
 And the Bible is full of stories about scars.

380
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,060
 And perhaps the most famous of those is the story of Thomas and the story of Jesus in

381
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,820
 His resurrection coming to Thomas in that room and Thomas reaching forward and touching

382
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,860
 the scars of Jesus.

383
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,820
 And we've come to call Thomas the doubting Thomas, and I think we so misunderstand this

384
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
 person.

385
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,060
 And I want to just take a few moments in the little bit of time that I've got remaining

386
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,900
 to open up this passage of Scripture to us because I think in here we see something in

387
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,500
 Thomas that's going to inspire you as you start your journey of post-traumatic growth.

388
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,340
 And let me read this to us from John chapter 20 starting in verse 24.

389
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,460
 "Now Thomas, called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.

390
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,140
 So when the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord.'

391
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:43,500
 But he said to them, 'Hey, unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger

392
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,060
 where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.'

393
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,580
 A week later his disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them.

394
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,940
 Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with

395
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,940
 you.'

396
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,740
 Then he said to Thomas, 'Hey, put your finger here and see my hands.

397
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,380
 Reach out your hand and put it in my side.

398
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,620
 Stop doubting and believe.'

399
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,580
 And Thomas said to him, 'My Lord and my God.'"

400
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,860
 I love this story of Thomas.

401
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,180
 I think it opens up for us so much of where we might be here at the beginning of 2021.

402
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,780
 You know, it's interesting that we call him the doubting Thomas.

403
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,860
 Jesus does say to him, "Stop doubting and believing."

404
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,420
 But it's important to put this in context because all of the disciples were doubting

405
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,420
 before they first met Jesus.

406
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,660
 It's not that Thomas was this special doubter who really struggled to believe that Jesus

407
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,140
 had risen from the dead.

408
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,420
 All of the disciples had that issue before they actually met the resurrected Christ.

409
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,660
 In fact, in the Gospel of John, John makes it an actual purpose in his narrative to explain

410
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,340
 the reality that all of the disciples were confused.

411
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,500
 There's even Mary right there in the garden tomb where Jesus has literally just been resurrected

412
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,900
 and she thinks Jesus is the gardener.

413
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,500
 And it's not until Jesus speaks that she recognizes him.

414
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,420
 And there are all the disciples in the room and Jesus comes and comes before them and

415
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,380
 they have no idea who he is.

416
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,260
 They're skeptical about his presence and Jesus volunteers to the disciples.

417
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,420
 He says, "Here, see the scars in my hands.

418
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,260
 See the scars and the wounds on my side.

419
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,360
 See this and know that I am now with you."

420
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,580
 And Thomas wasn't there in that moment.

421
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,920
 He was somewhere else.

422
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,220
 And so when the disciples begin to tell Thomas, "Hey, we've seen the risen Jesus."

423
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,720
 Here's Thomas's response.

424
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,340
 He says, "I won't believe that the person that you think is Jesus is actually my Messiah

425
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,820
 unless I have proof of the suffering that he went through."

426
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,660
 See, this is profound, guys, because where we've called him doubting Thomas, I think

427
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,980
 actually he's grieving Thomas.

428
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,900
 I think Thomas is actually the only disciple who understands that the identity of the Messiah,

429
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,060
 even in his resurrection, is rooted in an incredible experience of suffering that this

430
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,140
 one had been through.

431
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,140
 Where the others remained skeptical and Jesus had to volunteer his scars, Thomas is the

432
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,460
 only one who wants to look for them.

433
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:25,140
 He wants to actually see that Jesus is this one because for him, for Jesus is the one

434
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,580
 who's actually walking with a whole story of suffering that moves into transformation.

435
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,740
 For Thomas, for him to understand who the Messiah is, it is not to divorce him from

436
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
 the cross.

437
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:41,700
 It is not to suddenly look at Jesus as some triumphalistic kind of glory person who floats

438
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
 above the ground.

439
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,780
 For Thomas, no, his Messiah, his resurrected Jesus is going to be the one that's going

440
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,980
 to bear the scars of the pain and the suffering and the trauma and the grief of what he went

441
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,980
 through.

442
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:00,080
 Thomas saw the suffering of Christ and he wanted to touch the scars to know that this

443
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:08,300
 one was the one who had gone through the worst moment of life and yet now was transformed.

444
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:15,820
 You see, for Thomas, the scars were actually revealing the depth of the suffering being

445
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,300
 turned into transformation.

446
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:24,220
 The way that he wanted to understand the glory of the resurrection was never divorced from

447
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,540
 the pain of the cross.

448
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:33,880
 Thomas saw redemption not as the erasure of pain, the ending of pain.

449
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,880
 No, for Thomas, for him, redemption was about the ability to live beyond the pain and the

450
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:48,360
 suffering and yet in that carry with you the scars of that journey as a story to be told.

451
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:55,480
 And Thomas has the boldness, the courage to reach out and say to this person, "I won't

452
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,920
 believe that you're him unless you can show me that you have been transformed to the suffering

453
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,600
 that you've experienced."

454
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,960
 I think that's a profound reflection on the person of Thomas.

455
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,960
 And think about this from Jesus' perspective.

456
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,840
 You see, I don't know about you, but for me, with my scars, and I've got a few, I like

457
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,240
 to hide them from people because our scars, don't they become places of shame or embarrassment?

458
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,960
 I've got actually a big scar on my back from a botched surgery that I had in my 20s and

459
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,520
 I'm still a little bit embarrassed by it.

460
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,760
 It's a big kind of ugly kind of scar on my back and so I'm kind of glad it's behind me

461
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,200
 that I never get to see it.

462
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,040
 And even if I'm at a swimming pool or something and I got my shirt off and I'm a little bit

463
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,960
 conscious and aware of this big scar there, Jesus shows up to his disciples bearing the

464
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,960
 scars of an incredible trauma and he voluntarily shows it to them.

465
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,920
 There's no shame for Jesus in the suffering that he had been through.

466
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,480
 There was no shame for the fact that he had had wounds at one point in his life, but those

467
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,840
 wounds had taken sin and brought it to the grave.

468
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,120
 And he stands before them and he says, "Touch this, touch this, intimately come to me because

469
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,240
 these scars are proof that the wounding did not win.

470
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:19,080
 These scars are proof that resurrection life has happened, that sin has been put to death

471
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,800
 forever and now life is available for you.

472
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,720
 Come and touch the scars."

473
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,280
 I believe church that this is the call on us as we start this new year.

474
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:36,360
 I believe that Jesus leans forward to you no matter what you've come out of in 2020

475
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,760
 and he shows you his scars again and he welcomes you.

476
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,440
 He says, "Come and touch the place of my hand.

477
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,600
 Touch and see the place on my side.

478
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,520
 Come and see where the wounds have been turned into victory and transformation and life because

479
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:02,840
 if it happens to me, the same spirit that did this in me is now in you."

480
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,800
 That he can come and bring that change and that transformation to you.

481
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,360
 That's what this is all about.

482
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,520
 And perhaps like you, I'm carrying both wounds and scars as I step into 2021.

483
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,240
 I have scars from last year where there were really hard times but I overcame them.

484
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,920
 The spirit of God helped me and healed me and I'm victorious over them and I stand in

485
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,280
 2021 stronger because I bear some scars from last year.

486
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:37,160
 And I'm proud of that and I'm grateful for the work of Christ in my life.

487
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,600
 But I also carry wounds in me right here and right now.

488
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,640
 Places where I'm still looking for the healing to be complete.

489
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:53,040
 Places where I'm still desiring for Christ to come and close the wound and create a scar.

490
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,600
 And the other scars that I hold are proof to me.

491
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,880
 They preach to me.

492
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,920
 They speak over me that the wounds that I'm still carrying will not have the victory.

493
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,360
 That he can come and by the blood that he pours out on the cross, he can cover up the

494
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:15,440
 wounds that I still carry and bring them into a place of healed life.

495
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,360
 That's the growth that I believe God has for us as a church.

496
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,520
 I think that's the testimony and the legacy that Josh leaves us as a church.

497
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,600
 It's what we're now invited into.

498
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,760
 See, the cross of Jesus on the cross.

499
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,360
 God places God's woundedness before yours.

500
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,040
 And in that, he invites you to heal.

501
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,320
 That's the new year for us.

502
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,720
 An invitation to see the woundedness of Jesus on the cross and the scars that he carries

503
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,200
 in his resurrection.

504
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:01,760
 And look at all the woundedness that we carry and pray that God would create scars on us.

505
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,240
 And that in that, we might be able to celebrate a newness of life.

506
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,680
 Let me close by sharing some words from Josh that Josh wrote in a devotional that he produced

507
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,240
 and that is a part of our 21 Devay devotional that's coming up.

508
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,400
 And I want to read these words to you as an encouragement to you from him.

509
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:28,220
 He says this, "I have come to believe that God's plan and purpose are not as we might

510
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,800
 prefer to steer us away from the burdens and brokenness.

511
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,040
 Rather, each step we take with him takes us through valleys and hardships in baby steps

512
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,120
 that build our faith and our resilience.

513
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:49,020
 His power with our perseverance keeps us growing and continuing to be shaped into the incredible

514
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,520
 sons and daughters he's always planned for us to be.

515
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,600
 It is through suffering that we are made perfect in him."

516
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,040
 Think about that for a sec.

517
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,240
 It is through suffering that we are made perfect in him.

518
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,680
 We have all experienced some suffering in 2020.

519
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:17,120
 As we now step into 2021, may we now experience a release of the Spirit of God upon us that

520
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,500
 takes those wounds that we're carrying with us and brings them into a place of a scar.

521
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,160
 May we know that we have a Christ who comes forward to us with his hands that still bear

522
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,040
 the marks of all the pain he endured.

523
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:38,760
 And he says, "My pain for your healing, my death for your life, my cross for your carrying

524
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,640
 of it into newness of life."

525
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,080
 That's my prayer for us as a church as we step into this new year, post-traumatic growth.

526
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,840
 May it be with us, upon us, and through us in the name of Jesus.

527
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,400
 Let me pray for us.

528
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,220
 Father, we are just so grateful that here we stand as a church together today.

529
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,200
 And each one of us bears a story.

530
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,480
 Each one of us carries something upon us.

531
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,840
 And we do so in this moment of gravity as the beginning of the year.

532
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,480
 We recognize we have some grave clothes that linger.

533
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,480
 We recognize we have some wounds that still need to be healed.

534
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,800
 But Lord, we don't start this year thinking about the worst case scenarios.

535
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,520
 Father, we don't start this year tempted to hold ourselves back with a bit of timidity

536
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
 or uncertainty.

537
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,000
 No, no, Lord, we choose faith over uncertainty.

538
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,680
 We choose the reliance on the power of the Spirit of God over the brokenness that we

539
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,160
 so often feel.

540
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:50,760
 Lord, we know that through the life of Josh, we are inspired ourselves to find new life

541
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,120
 even in the hardest of moments.

542
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,320
 It's there that we come to you today.

543
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,560
 And through this series over the next six weeks, we pray that Lord, you will bring new

544
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,680
 life and new fellowship and new growth and new transformation for all of us here at Divine

545
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,040
 Church, for all of us in this community.

546
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,680
 I pray over every family, every marriage, over every relationship.

547
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,680
 I pray over every business, those that are searching for employment, those that are in

548
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,840
 a difficult moment of poverty, Lord.

549
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,760
 We stand in the places where each of our church are traveling right now.

550
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,260
 And we pray, Lord, that you would turn our wounds into scars.

551
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,760
 We pray, Lord, that you would walk us through it, Lord, that your presence would be with

552
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:41,200
 us manifesting your glory and your power in ways that we have never encountered before.

553
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,600
 Lord, we choose to grow.

554
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:52,440
 We choose to change, not in the power of positive thinking, but in the overwhelming majesty

555
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,040
 of your Spirit upon us.

556
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:01,000
 Come Holy Spirit, come, fall afresh on us.

557
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,960
 And may you bring us into the sons and daughters, as Josh wrote, that you had always planned

558
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,040
 us to be.

559
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,040
 May it be for your glory, in Jesus' name.

560
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,600
 Amen.

561
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,960
