[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   Oh, full, okay.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.980]   Today's gonna be fun.
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.740]   We're gonna be going through the parables again.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.860]   This is week two.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.540]   And just a bit of a reminder,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.780]   kind of a recap for all of us to get back on the same page
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.780]   'cause I sometimes talk too fast
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.860]   and I don't want anyone to get lost,
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.940]   so let me just kind of lay out what we're doing.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.980]   Picking up in the parables,
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.900]   we're gonna remember and recall the idea
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.100]   that the purpose of parables, pretty simple.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.700]   There's these big profound truths
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.780]   about the kingdom of God, about the kingdom of heaven,
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.540]   about the Father that can be challenging
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.020]   for us to fully grasp.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.540]   So Jesus knowing that provided these parables
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.580]   ways for us to be able to understand,
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.500]   for us to peel back into some of those layers.
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.940]   So using stories sometimes is the best way.
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.860]   So that's why we're doing this sermon series.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.200]   We've got four parables.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.700]   Last week, if you were here,
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.260]   Pastor Ellison walked us through the parable of the sower.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.160]   We saw all the different ideas of where the seed is thrown
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.580]   and ultimately the story and the meaning behind that
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.860]   was the soil of our hearts.
[00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.660]   We need to make sure the soil of our hearts
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.320]   is fertile ground for the word of God
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.300]   to actually be planted and to bloom and to live within us.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.420]   This week, we're gonna turn our attention
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.980]   towards Luke 15, looking at the parable
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.020]   of the prodigal son, or the lost son, or the two sons.
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.180]   Now this parable is, it's one of three actually in Luke 15.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.020]   Why do you keep saying John?
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.020]   In Luke 15.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.140]   So Jesus starts off by talking about some sheep
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.260]   and about how there's all these sheep this guy has
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.540]   and then he loses one and he goes and finds it
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.860]   and he rejoices, he's like,
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460]   "Celebrate with me, my lost sheep is back."
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.900]   And then he goes to a coin.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.860]   This lady has a bunch of coins and she loses one
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.500]   and she looks everywhere and finds the one coin
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.400]   and she celebrates, she says,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.260]   "Guys, come celebrate with me, rejoice, I found my coin."
[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.820]   And then so he takes the sheep, the coin,
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.340]   and then he like jumps like a massive level
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980]   and then brings it to family,
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.540]   talks about sons and about fathers
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.860]   and about the relationship and ends up looking at lost sons
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.460]   and that whole journey.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.500]   And so normally here at the Vine,
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.100]   what we would do is we would put up the text behind us
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.940]   and we would all read it,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.660]   or I would read it and you would watch.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.340]   But in the spirit of this being a parable,
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.580]   I kinda wanna take us to that posture
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.860]   of what it would have been like to hear it
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.780]   for the first time.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.300]   So back when Jesus was preaching,
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.140]   he didn't have PowerPoints,
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.220]   there wasn't a great creative team
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.140]   to make it all look nice.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.720]   So we're gonna go back to that space just for a minute.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660]   You won't be able to read along, that's on purpose,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.620]   we're not gonna put the scripture up.
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.220]   I'm gonna tell you the story.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.540]   And one of the ways I feel like
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.820]   it can really help you dive into this
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.340]   is if you sit back, relax, take a breath, get comfortable,
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.700]   close your eyes, but don't fall asleep, okay?
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.820]   Okay, I saw someone at 9.15,
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.140]   I didn't clarify that the first time.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.060]   Close your eyes, I'm just gonna tell you the story,
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.020]   I'm not actually gonna read it either,
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.340]   I'm gonna give you a rendition of it.
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.180]   And then what we're gonna do
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.100]   is we're gonna look at the characters,
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.540]   at what lessons is Jesus really wanting us
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.440]   to pull from this.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.340]   And actually, hopefully, understand more about God,
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.060]   and understand more about the kingdom of God.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.940]   So let me pray, and then you can close your eyes,
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.780]   and we're gonna get started.
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.300]   Jesus, we thank you for your word.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.940]   We thank you that you understood the human condition,
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.020]   and that we sometimes need stories
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.060]   to really understand and wrestle with your truth.
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.540]   So Holy Spirit, would you just be with us this morning
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.340]   as we look at this story of the two sons?
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.540]   Would you open our eyes, open our ears,
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.860]   to hear what it is that you want us to know
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.020]   about who you are, about the Father,
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.980]   and about the kingdom of God?
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.260]   We ask you these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.180]   All right, eyes closed, here we go.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.360]   There was a dude, there was a man,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.440]   there was an older guy who had two sons.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.100]   He had these two kids, and the youngest of the two kids
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.160]   was a little crazy.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.520]   He was like, "God, give me my inheritance now."
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.840]   So Dad gave him his inheritance.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.160]   He divided up his property
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.880]   and gave his son his inheritance early.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   And what did the son do?
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.400]   The son set off for a distant land, went far away,
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   and he spent all of his money on wild, reckless living.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.980]   And then, when he has no more money,
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.220]   just at that point, the nation that he's in
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.280]   goes into famine.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.540]   They can't grow any food, there's no water,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.540]   everything is tight and challenging,
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.300]   and he's hit rock bottom with money,
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.940]   and now the land he's in has no food,
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.100]   and there's no opportunity for him,
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.820]   and he's really looking for a place to go,
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.160]   and he doesn't have any money, so he tries to get a job.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.380]   He can't find anyone to give him a job,
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.540]   so he sees this one position open,
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.240]   and it's a pretty unfun position, it's feeding pigs.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.700]   So he takes the job feeding the pigs,
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.140]   and while he's out there feeding the pigs one day,
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.980]   making very little money, he's so hungry,
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.580]   I mean, he's desperately hungry,
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.660]   that the food the pigs are eating looks appetizing,
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.140]   so he wants to eat that.
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.460]   And then he has this moment where he comes to his senses,
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.580]   he's like, "Hold on, in my dad's house,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.360]   "you know, the servants have food to spare."
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.200]   So he's like, "You know what I'll do?
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.800]   "I'll pack up my things, and I'll go back to my dad,
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.180]   "and I'll tell him, 'Dad, I've sinned against heaven,
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.880]   "'and against you, I'm no longer worthy
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.720]   "'to be called your son, but if you would just give me
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.640]   "'a position as a servant.'"
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.320]   So he got his little speech together,
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.960]   and he picked up nothing that he had,
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.720]   and just walked back, started going back.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.220]   And while he was a long ways off,
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.220]   the father sees him, and in his compassion, in his joy,
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.540]   he runs to his son, and throws his arms around him,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.640]   and kisses him, and the son's like,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.340]   "Father, I'm no longer worthy to be called your son,
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.660]   "I have sinned against heaven, and against you."
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.600]   And the father stops him, and he's like,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.080]   "Y'all, let's celebrate.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.720]   "Go get the fattest cow we have.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.800]   "Bring a ring and put it on his hand.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.760]   "Grab some sandals for him, put a robe around him.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.580]   "My son, who was lost, is now found."
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.660]   So they did, they got a party together.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.940]   And the older son, who was there, was out in the fields,
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.980]   and he was working, and he heard all this ruckus,
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.500]   and this noise, so he makes his way back over.
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.820]   He's asking the servants, "What's going on?"
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.420]   Servants like, "Your brother, who was lost, is back.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.780]   "Your dad's killed the biggest cow that we have for him."
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.780]   So brother gets a bit annoyed and frustrated,
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.560]   so annoyed that he won't even go into the celebration.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.260]   The father comes out, and pleased with his son,
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.660]   and his son's like, "Dad, I've been here the whole time.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.460]   "I've never disobeyed a word that you said,
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.000]   "and you've not even killed a goat for me,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.400]   "for me and my friends."
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.460]   The dad says, "You have me with you always,
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.280]   "but listen, we have to rejoice.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.760]   "We have to celebrate, because your brother,
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.020]   "who was once lost, is now found."
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.980]   You can open your eyes again.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.300]   This is one of the most beautiful stories of love
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.780]   in all of Scripture.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.820]   It's incredible, right, but it's complex.
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.320]   It's deep, and it revolves around
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.220]   these three main characters.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.660]   There's the father, there's the son,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.180]   who runs away and squanders all the money,
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.300]   and then there's the son, who stays
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.100]   and has something to say to the dad.
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.660]   And I think what Jesus meant to do
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.380]   was for us to look at these three characters,
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.100]   look at the concepts of the story,
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.500]   and really understand what the kingdom of heaven is like,
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.340]   and what the father himself is like.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.940]   So we're gonna do that by first looking at the first son,
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.260]   and seeing what lesson does Jesus ultimately
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.080]   wanna teach us through this first son.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.940]   So that first son, the one that runs away,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.880]   gets the money, runs off, goes to a faraway land.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.400]   I found this detail very interesting.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.760]   He goes far away.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.680]   He gets his money, rather than going next door
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.440]   or going to the neighboring, he goes to a distant land,
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.560]   away from everyone, to do his own thing.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.360]   Doesn't wanna be in a relationship with anybody anymore,
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.680]   doesn't want any accountability,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.640]   wants to go and do his own thing.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.600]   So he does that, he emancipates himself,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.800]   he removes himself from the family.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.780]   He goes and he has no stewardship at all, no home training.
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.060]   He spends all his money and does a poor job budgeting.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.420]   And once that's done, the land ends up in famine,
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.100]   which is terrible, so now he's hitting rock bottom.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.620]   There's nothing he can do to get himself back up.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.140]   He said he's eating the food of pigs,
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.260]   and I think we're all familiar with that part.
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.460]   His life literally couldn't get any worse,
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.500]   and I think it's really interesting,
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.100]   'cause I think maybe for lots of us
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.080]   who might have hit a version of rock bottom,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.300]   we found this, in that moment of rock bottom,
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.580]   something clicks.
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.460]   He has a bit of an experience, something changes.
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.680]   It says that he comes to his senses.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:22.160]   I think the first truth that we see around this parable
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.620]   is what repentance is.
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.740]   Repentance is much like coming to your senses.
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.740]   To come to one's senses would mean that
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.980]   whatever you might have believed prior to that moment,
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.340]   you now understand is incorrect, it was misleading.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.160]   It was an illusion, or at best, it was incomplete.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.740]   And all the son had done before,
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.500]   all of his actions of reckless spending and running away
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.900]   and taking his dad's stuff,
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.740]   was based off of his perspective,
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.700]   based off of the way that he saw things.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.540]   And so to repent, that first stage looks like
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.100]   changing the way that we see, coming to our senses.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.660]   To repent is to have a new perspective.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.440]   It must mean that we have to think differently
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.040]   about our situation, about our sin.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   We must have that change of perspective
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.520]   and that coming to our senses.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.200]   But we know, we all know that it doesn't end there, right?
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.720]   Repentance can't just be the way that you see things.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.400]   It can't just be about more head knowledge
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.120]   or more information.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.440]   Just because you understand more
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.160]   or because you have more information
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.080]   doesn't really make the change, does it?
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.480]   I mean, think about our culture today.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.720]   We have access to the most amount of information
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.540]   ever than any period in history.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.800]   That doesn't necessarily mean
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.120]   that things are changing for the better.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.720]   What we don't need is necessarily more information.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.040]   Sometimes what we do need is more obedience.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.640]   And what does information do if there is no action?
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.240]   So although, yes, repentance will start
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.160]   with that turning of the mind
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.800]   and more information being changed,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   it must lead, it mandates that we then turn our will,
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.080]   that we then turn our actions,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.200]   that we then turn ourselves.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.160]   You're probably wondering why am I saying the word turn?
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.780]   Well, the word repent itself means to turn.
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.200]   So if I'm repenting, if I'm walking this way,
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   to repent would mean to turn around, right?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.880]   So that's what this young man is doing.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.760]   He is turning around in his mind and his perspective,
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.120]   but then he also physically turns around.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.360]   He returns to the Father.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.660]   He leaves his foolish thinking and his foolish living,
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.040]   and he makes his way back to the Father.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.800]   And what Jesus partially tells us this story
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.240]   so that we can get to this next part
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.460]   about what happens next,
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.320]   when we would turn and we would repent,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.540]   which is actually the reason I was so excited
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.360]   about preaching this specific sermon
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.200]   is for this next section.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.560]   The son that repents and turns, what happens to him next?
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.960]   The story goes that, well, the Father does something crazy,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   does something radical, something that is off script
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.480]   that no one would expect, right?
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.560]   The Father isn't reckless.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.800]   The Father is responding to deep love.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.400]   The Father is calculated.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.760]   The actions of the Father
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.960]   are therefore interested in restoring.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.800]   The text would say this,
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.240]   while he was a long way off, speaking of the son,
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.780]   his father saw him and was filled with compassion.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.880]   He ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.760]   The son said, "Father, I've sinned against heaven
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.600]   "and against you.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.080]   "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.180]   But the father said to his servants,
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.400]   "Quick, bring the best robe, put it on him.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.580]   "Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.040]   "Bring the fattened calf and kill it.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.520]   "Let's have a feast and celebrate,
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.680]   "for the son of mine was dead and is alive again.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.200]   "He was lost and is now found."
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.400]   So they began to celebrate.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.640]   The father is overjoyed to see the son again.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.200]   He doesn't wait for the son to make it all the way back.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.400]   He says, while he was a long way off,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.360]   the father sprints toward him.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.120]   The son's not even close to being home yet.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.720]   The father doesn't even meet him halfway.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.740]   This idea that God's gonna meet us halfway
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.580]   is not biblical, right?
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.840]   Like God goes the whole way.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.800]   Like the son is all the way over there
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.640]   and the father sees that he's turned around
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.040]   and is coming back and he runs towards him
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.880]   in compassion, overjoyed about this.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.200]   And I think it gets me, what gets me is
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.240]   when I try to visualize how beautiful this is.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.600]   I think about my three-year-old son
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.200]   and how if there was a moment where he's coming to me,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.320]   we used to live in Chonquano
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.980]   and I used to get home from work late
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.920]   and it'd be around maybe like seven or something
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.840]   and my wife would leave our estate
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.240]   and start walking towards us and I'd be walking home.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.100]   And the second I saw my son,
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.280]   I mean, I didn't physically run
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.200]   because it's hot in Hong Kong, but my heart ran.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.880]   I was thrilled, I was so excited.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.040]   I could only imagine, you know,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.360]   when I've not seen my son for a whole day,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.080]   this dude's son has been in a different country.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.640]   The condition and the appearance of the son is saddening,
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.480]   probably breaks his heart.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.680]   So it probably pushes him even more into that moment.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.660]   But the father runs to him, drops everything
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.620]   and is filled with compassion to see his boy again.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:09.780]   This is a decisive and aggressive, fervent love.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.660]   It's extreme grace.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.180]   And it's extreme grace because note this,
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.300]   the father could have just forgiven him.
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.620]   This would have been a beautiful parable
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.140]   if it was about how a son really messed up.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.080]   I mean, as bad as it gets and he gets what he deserves.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.440]   And when he comes and tries to apologize,
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.380]   the father says, "Okay, you're forgiven."
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.260]   And that's the end of the parable.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.580]   If that was the story,
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.020]   that would be a pretty powerful parable.
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.220]   But it doesn't just stop there.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.180]   The father's love is so extreme.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.180]   It's so extreme that the son tries to get out his phrase,
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.580]   "Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:45.500]   I'm no longer worried."
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.140]   And I imagine the father just putting his hand
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.320]   to his son's mouth, saying, "Stop, you're my son.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.260]   You're here, that's what matters."
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.100]   And the father doesn't just forgive him.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.900]   The father reinstates him.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.740]   Rather than saying, "All is forgiven.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.380]   Your slate is clean."
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.700]   The father says, "Go get the best stuff we have.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.420]   Get the best robe," he says.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.100]   "Get a ring, get a sandal, kill the A5 Wagyu."
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.660]   Like he wants the good stuff for his son
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.180]   who has just done all this mess.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.640]   He does not just forgive us, he reinstates.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.140]   And I think we have to come to the understanding
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.780]   that this is God's posture.
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.280]   This is the father's posture to us as well.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.560]   Can we talk about how,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.340]   if I put myself in the position of the son,
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.100]   forgiveness would have been great.
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.100]   But I wonder how he felt when his dad hugged him
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.420]   in that moment.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.740]   I wonder what he felt when he's dirty and stinky
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.860]   and smelly and tired and exhausted and not worthy,
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.860]   yet his father throws his arms around him.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.780]   Talk about getting more than you deserve.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.060]   I feel like that motion probably,
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:03.060]   that moment probably flooded him with plenty of emotion
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.800]   to be received again.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.680]   See, the father had no intention
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.780]   of making a repentant son a slave.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.980]   And I think we have to hear that
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.140]   for what it's really saying.
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.760]   Our father has no intention
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.260]   of making a repentant us a slave,
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.020]   but rather in his great joy,
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.500]   he restores us back to sonship and daughtership.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.020]   It is joy that he does it.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.460]   It's not because he has to,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.540]   because he's God, because he's obligated.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.540]   It's within his joy.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.420]   If you don't believe me,
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.780]   three different times it says it.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.620]   In the first parable about the sheep,
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.820]   it says this, at the very end of it,
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.480]   he goes, "Rejoice with me, I have found my lost sheep."
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.900]   When the parable gets to the next part about the coin,
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.480]   the woman says, "Rejoice with me, I have found my lost coin."
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.060]   When it gets to the son for the third time,
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.780]   "Rejoice and celebrate, be glad."
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.520]   There is joy that God feels about restoring you.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.240]   When you come back, it is in his joy to bring you,
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.860]   not just to forgive you, but to reinstate you,
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.160]   to bring you into the family of God.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.480]   Because in that space,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.980]   there is a relationship that is restored.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.820]   In that space, there is hope,
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.700]   there is meaning, there is identity.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.080]   He wants to provide all of that for us.
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.340]   This restored identity is a theme
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.980]   that we cannot afford to overlook.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.540]   There's something to be said about how identity
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:28.660]   and relationship are major threads into this story,
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.580]   and into the kingdom of God as a whole.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.220]   I think that's why this story is drenched
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.700]   with identity imagery.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.580]   Did you notice how every main character
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.820]   isn't referred to by their name, or by their job?
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:45.340]   It's the father, it's the son, it's the other son.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.700]   Right, like who they are communicated as
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.080]   is based off of relationship.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.780]   Relationship is so important.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.260]   It elevates the meaning of this parable.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.420]   Let me think about it this way.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.740]   What if this parable wasn't called the prodigal son?
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.840]   What if it was called the prodigal friend?
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.780]   So you guys know Jethro, who leads worship here,
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.660]   stunning young man with the guitar.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.180]   He's a good friend of mine.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.060]   If Jethro took my money and went to Indonesia,
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.420]   I love you Jethro, and spent it all,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.620]   and got what he deserved, lost his money,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.380]   and is eating pig food, comes back to Hong Kong,
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.420]   and is like, "Bro, I'm sorry."
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.820]   Okay, well, first of all, I'm a pastor,
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.900]   so I'm gonna say, "Yes, Jethro, I forgive you."
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.400]   Right, that's what pastors and Christians do.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.460]   But if my son, Elias, made the same mistake,
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.420]   hear this, it would hurt significantly more.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.540]   It really would, it would tear me apart.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.580]   But if he came back, that joy would be ridiculous.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.700]   And I would not stop at saying, "You're forgiven, son.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.540]   "Now go do your thing.
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.860]   "You're forgiven, come be a servant."
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.820]   No, I would throw my arms around him,
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.820]   'cause he's my boy, 'cause he's my kid, he's me.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.140]   Right, and I think if you understand this story,
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.100]   and you understand the power of family,
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.660]   that's what Jesus is talking about.
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.180]   It's not just about the forgiveness of the sin,
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.660]   it's about the ultimate goal being restoring us
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.420]   into the right identity.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.020]   The scriptures talk about this all over the place.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.900]   Why do you think it is that we're called sons and daughters
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.420]   of God, children of God?
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.820]   When Jesus would teach the disciples to pray,
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.940]   which I find very fascinating,
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.660]   the one thing they tell him is, "Teach us this."
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.740]   They could ask him, "Teach us anything."
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.260]   He says, "Teach us how to pray."
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.660]   So Jesus says, "Okay, fine, I'll teach you how to pray."
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.300]   At that time, their posture towards divinity
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.900]   was that God is holy, God is Yahweh,
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.840]   you know, we gotta be careful,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.980]   make sure we don't sin too much,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.260]   like go through all these rituals.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.660]   He says, "When you pray, pray like this."
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.860]   Our father, relationship.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.740]   Not our extreme maker who is bigger than everything
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.620]   or Elohim or our father.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.900]   There is something so significant
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.100]   in this relationship identity concept
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.540]   that the scripture wants us to understand
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.700]   and it's because of this.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   As children of God, we get certain perks.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.080]   There are things that happen within the family
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.460]   that won't happen outside the family.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.220]   The way I love my son would be inappropriate
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.060]   for me to love any other person that way.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.420]   The way I love my spouse or my daughter
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.260]   would be very different
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.780]   than the way I'm gonna love my friends
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.300]   or the way I'm gonna engage with my friends.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.620]   See, when you're in the family, there's something different.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.380]   There's a grace that's for the family,
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.380]   there's a certain compassion that's for the family.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.100]   The family deeply matters.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.180]   I think about how my son, although he's three,
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.820]   and let me just say, I overestimated three, y'all.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.400]   He is, whew, he's perfect, but man, I'm stressing.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.520]   He does a lot of stuff and I can never,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.480]   I can't think of a reason that I would never love him.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.520]   Like, I would love him no matter what.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.600]   Like, he's great, but he's three, but he's great.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.440]   But then there's you guys who, I like you,
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.520]   but I'm sure there are things you can do
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.820]   to make me stop liking you real quick.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.200]   All right, some of you don't have to try that hard.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   It's pretty easy for some.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.200]   But not with my kid, not with my family.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.560]   And God has this posture towards us.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.700]   That's why the ultimate blessing,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.200]   the ultimate thing we can receive is not a gift,
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.860]   a Ferrari or a better job
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.720]   or a more stable relationship at home.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.200]   The ultimate gift we can get
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.960]   is to be brought back into his family.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.300]   That's what Emma was talking about.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.500]   By the blood of Jesus, we're not just forgiven,
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.620]   we're brought into his family.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.620]   This is how God intended humanity to be,
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.160]   in relationship with him, heirs of his,
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.100]   made to be like him, protected by him, his children.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.740]   This is why Jesus in John three
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.240]   would speak to Nicodemus at night and he would say,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.000]   "You must be, you must be born again.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.340]   "You must be born into this family
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.060]   "because if you are in this family,
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.140]   "there is no sin that is deep enough
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.860]   "to separate me from you.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.820]   "When you're mine, you're mine,
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.560]   "and I will go through anything to get you back."
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.660]   And this story ultimately is illustrating
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.880]   that exact thing, the perks that come
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.960]   with being sons and daughters of God.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:12.920]   By repenting of our sins, by turning from our wrongdoings,
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.820]   as a child of God, know that you have access
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.820]   to the most extreme grace that there is.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.960]   Now, we've talked about two characters.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.440]   We've first looked at the crazy son,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.120]   we've looked at the father and the grace
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.400]   that is just flowing from him.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.440]   But there's a third character that we cannot overlook,
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   and the only way to really understand him
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.880]   is to understand the context of this parable.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.840]   This parable is something that maybe is good for all of us
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   in our basic Bible reading and scripture studying.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.800]   It's always good to ask ourselves,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.440]   "How did we get to this point?"
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.680]   Jesus might say something wild.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.000]   Ask yourself, "What made him say that?"
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.720]   I think if we ask ourselves this question in this parable,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.080]   "Why is Jesus telling a parable about sons?
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.140]   "What is he responding to?
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.320]   "What is making him tell this story?"
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:02.080]   If you look at Luke chapter 15 at verse two,
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.480]   you get this context of the Pharisees,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.320]   who are the religious leaders of the day,
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.880]   the tax collectors and sinners,
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.520]   you know, the degenerates, the worst of society,
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.000]   all gather together around to hear Jesus.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.660]   And the Pharisees, the teachers of the law,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.440]   they muttered, so not intended to be heard,
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.120]   to one another, they say this,
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.780]   "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.460]   This is our context.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.720]   The fact that Jesus, the one who does the big miracles,
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.640]   the one claiming to be the way, the truth and the life,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.760]   this holy man, is spending his time
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.460]   with the worst of society.
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.040]   What's this guy really thinking?
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.700]   Like, can you be God and spend time with such filthy people?
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.080]   With the worst people, the cheaters, the liars,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.440]   the prostitutes, the tax collectors, the thieves,
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.520]   the worst that society has to offer,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.620]   yet Jesus is sharing meals, spending his time with them.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.040]   So they say something about it.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.320]   They don't have the courage to say it to Jesus,
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.480]   so they say it to one another.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.560]   They mutter it.
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.960]   This man is hanging out with the worst people.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.640]   And in response to that, Jesus hears it.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.880]   He knows their heart.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.480]   In response to that, he tells them
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.840]   this trilogy of parables about coins, about sheep,
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.680]   and then ends with the big one about family,
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.600]   about the sons.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:24.620]   And I think it's interesting that this ending,
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.280]   the story that he tells, it talks about a father,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.800]   it talks about the degenerate, it talks about the holy.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.040]   That's what the parable's about, right?
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.000]   The son, the father, and another son.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.580]   The people in this room, there's Jesus,
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.480]   who claims to be God, the father.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.880]   There's the holy ones, the Pharisees,
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.040]   who know all the laws, who do everything right.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.860]   And then there's the tax collectors and the sinners.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.360]   See, there's a lesson Jesus wants us to see.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.480]   He's using this story to tell the Pharisees
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.760]   and the sinners about how God sees sinners.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   So that's something we can't afford to miss in this.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.240]   How does God see the sinner?
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.720]   When he's telling this story,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.320]   I imagine that the crowd is expecting
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.200]   that if this son did this much damage,
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.280]   he takes his dad money and runs off.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.600]   When he comes back, they're probably expecting
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.960]   he's probably not gonna get brought back into the family.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.520]   He's gonna get rebuked.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.340]   He's gonna get told off, get scolded.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.300]   Maybe lectured.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:29.440]   But Jesus is clever with his wording.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.280]   Jesus says that the father welcomes the son.
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.020]   Well, what's the first accusation
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.120]   about what Jesus is doing in that moment?
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.000]   Back in chapter two, or in verse two.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.320]   It says that they're annoyed and frustrated.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.980]   This man welcomes and eats with sinners.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.240]   In the story that Jesus tells, what happens?
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.800]   The father, this great man, welcomes back his son,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.480]   puts the clothes and puts the robe
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.340]   and brings him back into the house,
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.240]   and then he does what?
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.540]   He takes them to lavash and they have a meal, right?
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.560]   They kill the fattened cow.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.720]   He welcomes and he eats in the story and in the accusation.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:09.600]   Jesus is being direct in story form.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.040]   He's providing groundbreaking revelation,
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.760]   making it clear that God is not just our creator.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.640]   He's not just powerful Yahweh, but he's father.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.400]   And how does he see the sinner?
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.440]   How does the father see the sinner?
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.700]   Well, this is where it's key.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.600]   For the sinner who will come to their senses
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.440]   and will recognize their sin,
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.020]   and who will just attempt to make his way back home,
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.420]   how does the father respond?
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:44.360]   With ridiculous grace, with extreme grace,
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.760]   going way beyond what you need, what you want,
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.680]   beyond forgiveness into restoration,
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.280]   he brings you back in.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.260]   Jesus tells this parable so that they would understand
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.840]   that if God comes down to earth,
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.200]   he's not hanging out with the holy people.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.720]   When God comes down to earth, he's going for the lost.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.400]   He's spending his time with those who are broken,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.280]   those who are vulnerable.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.120]   He's not gonna be concerned about maintaining his privilege
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.720]   or his status as God.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.120]   He's gonna be with those who are broken.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.280]   And if you think that God only cares for you
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.720]   if you do a good job with those who are within the church
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.120]   or those who have it right,
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.280]   then you might know the rules of God,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.280]   but you don't know his heart.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   That's what Jesus is saying in this parable.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.360]   It becomes so clear that the religious leaders,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.460]   they don't actually know the father at all,
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.800]   'cause they couldn't be more wrong
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.640]   about how he would respond, right?
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.800]   And this is why, because they are the religious leaders.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.000]   They set the climate, the temperature of what it means
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.520]   to be a follower of Yahweh, to have good spirituality.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.560]   And it's clear from this that they don't even know
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.840]   the father, right?
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.300]   Because they would see it as,
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.760]   well, we're Pharisees, these are sinners.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.280]   It would say in the Gospel of Matthew
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.800]   that Pharisees were very concerned about their status,
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.440]   about being upright, about, you know,
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.400]   they would dress a certain way.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.520]   When they went outside the streets,
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.360]   they would pray in a certain voice,
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.400]   pretty loud to be heard.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.680]   When they fasted, they were a bit dramatic about it,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.400]   you know, like soccer players and flopping.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.720]   They were like, oh, I'm fasting,
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.560]   making sure everyone knew that, you know,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.280]   they were all about the image and the appearance.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.360]   Well, Jesus is contrasting himself with them,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.900]   because just like the Pharisees,
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.560]   Jesus sees that these are tax collectors.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.840]   He knows.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.600]   He knows that Matthew was cheating people from their money.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.520]   He knew about Zechariah's problem.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.120]   He knows that they're prostitutes.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.680]   He knows their sin.
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.520]   Think back to John 4, the woman at the well.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.520]   He knows that she has multiple husbands, right?
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.360]   But what does he do?
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.780]   His privilege of being God
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.880]   does not stop him from coming close.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.720]   Hear that.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.960]   Because he's God doesn't mean
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.740]   he won't come close to our mess.
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.940]   Jesus would spin this story around
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.640]   telling of a prodigal son
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.920]   and telling of the position of our attitudes
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.060]   and the attitude of the older brother
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:08.060]   as being most clearly reflected in that of the Pharisees,
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.280]   who are, get this, it kind of,
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.480]   just when you think about it like this, it drives me,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.060]   the Pharisees are holding Jesus's compassion against him.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.600]   That's a hard way to look at it.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.800]   Because he's so compassionate, they're angry.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.380]   And this is exactly what you see in that final brother,
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.220]   that last kid.
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.620]   That's why you have to know the context.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.480]   Because of Jesus's compassion, they're angry.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.560]   Well, look at that older brother, what happens with him?
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.960]   He's angry that the younger brother
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.320]   who's been reckless and wild,
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.520]   whose life has been falling apart,
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.240]   comes back home and the father throws his arms over him,
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.680]   gives him all this stuff, gives him the fatted calf,
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.860]   celebrates and is rejoicing with him.
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:52.680]   The older son and the Pharisees share the same perspective.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.000]   And as I studied this,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.080]   I knew there were a lot of obvious points to make,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.120]   but there was something that hit me for the first time.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.080]   So the way the story goes is that the younger brother,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   when he gets what he wants from dad,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.800]   he runs to a different land, right?
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.180]   He goes far, far away, like Jethro going far away.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.240]   The older brother says that,
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.640]   "I stayed in your house the whole time.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.480]   "I was close to you.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.440]   "I was always obeying you, doing exactly what you wanted."
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.680]   So how then does the older brother
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.760]   who has stayed close to the father
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.840]   know the details of the sin of the younger brother?
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.920]   The younger brother was in a distant land.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.000]   The older brother stayed close to dad.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.840]   It's extra to say that, right?
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:29.920]   I've stayed close to you,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.560]   I've done what you're supposed to do.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:32.840]   How does he know what the brother has done?
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.000]   Has he hired a spy?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.640]   Does he have a scouting report on what his brother's doing?
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.800]   How is he aware?
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.960]   I mean, because you would think that to be
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.880]   in the father's house, your focus would be on the father.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.440]   Hear that?
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.920]   See, the older brother is more focused on gathering
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.120]   a report of what the younger brother has done wrong.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.360]   He has, maybe he's remained in the house,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.960]   but he has not abided in the father
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.000]   because the father is compassionate,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.480]   whereas the older brother is judgmental.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.000]   While in the father's house,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.740]   focused on the wrongdoings of others.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.680]   This is the heart of the Pharisees.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.880]   This is the way that they naturally found themselves.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.400]   But I think we have to be careful
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.320]   because sometimes this can be us.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.960]   This could be you and me sitting in this room.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.680]   I think we have to ask ourselves these questions regularly.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.120]   Are we becoming more like Christ and his love
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.160]   for the broken, for the worst of humanity,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.440]   or becoming more self-righteous?
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.800]   Do we just wanna see them get what they deserve?
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.360]   Before we dismiss it quickly,
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.600]   because no one likes the title of self-righteousness,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.280]   remember this, the Pharisees had all the laws memorized.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.120]   They did it all right.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.520]   They were the ones who prayed with the best words,
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.080]   and they were the ones who fasted regularly,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.280]   and they had memorized the first five books of the Bible.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.280]   I mean, they got it, they understood it.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.800]   They were like the pastors of the day.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.840]   I think we could come in every Sunday
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.720]   and we can raise our hands during worship
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.920]   or clap when Emma starts talking about the blood of Jesus.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.780]   You know, amen.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.320]   We can take our phones out and take a photo
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.080]   when there's a tweetable line in the sermon,
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.840]   but does that mean anything?
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.720]   Because that's not the indicator
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.120]   of the transition that we have to be going through,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.120]   of the transformation that God really intends
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.440]   for those of us who remain here with him.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.160]   To be offended by God's heart for the lost.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.360]   This is their attitude even though they do everything right.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.840]   And I think we gotta be careful to make sure
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.360]   that just because we come, we don't end up in that place
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.160]   looking at, oh, God, I've done all these things
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.400]   and they've done nothing.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.720]   We don't wanna be those kinds of people.
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.360]   I don't want us to be those kinds of people.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.440]   Our proximity to Christ isn't a badge we wear
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.400]   that makes us better than other people.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.720]   It's not.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.800]   It's not our permission to point and say,
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.620]   look how bad they're doing.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.320]   Doesn't give us a right to get online
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.860]   and blast everyone that's not a Christian
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.640]   for the ridiculous things that they might do.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.480]   Guess what?
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.400]   They're not Christians.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.240]   Imagine that.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.240]   No, our proximity to God is meant to draw us close to him
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.360]   so that we can be transformed by him.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.000]   Being close to God is less about being holier than others.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.240]   It's more about becoming like him,
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.920]   becoming extreme in our grace,
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.400]   choosing compassion over judgment,
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.800]   oozing with compassion when our brothers and sisters
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.000]   are lost, being excited to see them come home,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.620]   co-laboring with the Father.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.800]   That's my heart for me, my family.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.840]   That's my heart for us as a community.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.600]   That in our weekly gatherings,
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.560]   in the gatherings that take place outside of Sundays here,
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.480]   that we would be growing in our likeness of God.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.800]   That our hearts would be becoming softer
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.280]   and being more like his.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.000]   That he would replace the heart of stone
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.040]   and give us a heart of flesh.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.280]   That he would wipe away the scales from our eyes
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.500]   and we would see people the way that he sees them,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.000]   being shaped like him.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.280]   That we would be broken for the lost
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.200]   the way that he's broken for the lost.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.080]   That we would rejoice when they come home.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.760]   We would rejoice when they repent.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.880]   And for me, where I find this most challenging,
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.320]   I have to ask myself this,
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   would I be rejoicing, celebrating,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.520]   in the worst person that I know,
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.320]   most filthy person that I know,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.540]   the liar, the cheater,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.760]   the one who's weaseled their way,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.880]   who's offended me,
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.160]   comes into God's family,
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.460]   and he gets the exact same privilege as I do.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.600]   Can I celebrate at that?
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:38.680]   Because I think it's that what drives the son crazy,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.160]   it's not just that he's forgiven,
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.200]   it's that he's now restored to the same level.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.840]   And that blood of Jesus, like Emma said,
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.920]   that is our ultimate equalizer.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.320]   That's what makes us all be able to be
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.040]   on the same level again.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.280]   And that's what the father is ultimately showing us
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280]   through all of this.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.240]   Now, with all this repentance and grace,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.900]   I think there's one last question
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.520]   that I want us to kind of wrestle with a little bit
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.880]   before we get to a closing point.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   See, what do you think those who were sinning,
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.240]   those who were the sinners,
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.460]   Jesus was having dinner with them, right?
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.000]   What do you think they were thinking?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.760]   How do you think they felt when the holy teacher, Jesus,
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.960]   talks about God welcoming sinners?
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.800]   What do you think their feelings were in that moment?
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.880]   Because they would be well acquainted with their sins,
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.980]   they know where they've fallen short.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.940]   I wonder if when they hear that the father welcomes back,
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.740]   kills the shattered calf,
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.980]   puts the ring on the arm, on the finger,
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.100]   I wonder if maybe goosebumps happened, you know?
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.340]   I wonder if like, they might have gotten choked up
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.560]   a little bit, maybe a lump in their throat,
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.980]   maybe a little heavy breathing.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.660]   Because to know that God is going to respond
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.400]   with such grace if we repent can be liberating.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.460]   It can lead us to actual repentance.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.500]   I think this is what Jesus is trying to show us
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.020]   with this whole story.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.400]   Could it be that by learning of the father's posture
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.300]   for restoring those who are lost,
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.700]   some of their hearts are softened?
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.680]   Could that be the same for us?
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.140]   That if you ask yourself this,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.940]   if you could really understand
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.500]   that no matter what it is that you've done,
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.300]   it doesn't matter how bad it is, I mean, the worst thing,
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.880]   if you were to have a come to your senses moment,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.980]   if we were just to turn,
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.500]   remember, you don't have to have it all right yet,
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.260]   if we were just to start that journey back home,
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.980]   the father doesn't just say, good job,
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.540]   thanks for not sinning anymore.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:48.500]   He rejoices, like joy, happiness, celebration,
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.580]   let's throw a party, that's his response.
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.860]   The scriptures would say that the angels in heaven
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.560]   are celebrating over this.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.740]   I wonder if we could get that.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.380]   How would that impact our desire
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.380]   or our courage to actually repent?
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:08.700]   Oftentimes, repentance is seen as this doom and gloom thing,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.180]   but this shows us that repentance
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.700]   is something that's met with joy.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.660]   We don't have to be all serious and sad when we repent.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.220]   We come back to God and he's excited to have us.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.980]   He loves us, overflowing with joy.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.660]   If we understand that repentance is a joyful moment,
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.660]   would we dare repent more?
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.460]   Could it be something that we would do regularly?
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.220]   'Cause here's the thing, this is what Satan's trying to do.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.580]   Here's the big picture.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.340]   Go back to Genesis for a second.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.600]   When Adam and Eve sin in the garden,
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.060]   they take the bite of the apple,
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.860]   they recognize that they're naked, and what do they do?
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.580]   They hide.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.380]   They distance themselves.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.200]   They separate, sin separates us from God,
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.420]   but this is what grace does.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.620]   Grace says that if you would come to your senses,
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.420]   if you would put your faith in Jesus,
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.180]   if you would understand that he is the way,
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.100]   the truth, and the life,
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.580]   if you would just make an effort to come towards him,
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.260]   you don't have to get it all right,
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.560]   but if you would just take a step, he'll meet you.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.580]   He'll sprint towards you, and he will be so glad,
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.620]   not just to forgive,
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.900]   but to make you a part of the family again,
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.720]   to make you an heir, someone who gets things from him,
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.000]   someone who is loved by him,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.400]   someone who is protected by him, taken care of by him.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:29.040]   Guys, I pray this is something that we can understand
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:29.880]   and fully get.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.480]   I pray that the courage needed
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.900]   from an understanding of the extreme grace of the Father
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.720]   would find its way to you,
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.600]   because repentance is a bit of an invitation.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:46.040]   It's God making it clear that you're welcomed back
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.760]   and you're wanted back.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.280]   So I think we all need to keep this in mind.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.640]   You're wanted.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.000]   God wants you in his family.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.320]   If he didn't, he would just forgive you
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.600]   and let you on your way.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.120]   But he wants you to be a part of that family.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.960]   He wants you to be under that covering,
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.240]   under that protection.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.960]   He desires to see you not just forgiven of your sin.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.000]   John 3:16, "For God so hated sin
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.840]   "that he came into the world."
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.720]   No, for God so loved the world.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.260]   His posture is love towards you.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.580]   He desires to see you flourish, to see you at peace,
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.260]   to see you the way that he's intended your life to be.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:27.540]   And that takes place when we're able to turn from our sins.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.100]   Here, I wanna leave us with this.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.580]   As the worship team makes their way up,
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.260]   there is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis quotes.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.780]   And if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is,
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.060]   the 90th series is incredible.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.020]   Please read it.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.820]   It'll enrich your life.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.560]   But Lewis, in one of his books called "The Screwtape Letters,"
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.120]   which is a book where demons are writing letters
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.000]   to Satan about people.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.220]   Very wild, very crazy, but very insightful.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.360]   This one demon is writing.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   And he says this about the human effort,
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.600]   about the divine satisfaction and love.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.760]   And it is profound and it blows my mind.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.800]   And it stays with me.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   I've written songs about it.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.360]   I've talked about it like all the time.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.940]   I wanna leave you guys with it
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.000]   'cause I hope it can help you.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.760]   It says this, "He," meaning the father,
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.240]   "He wants them," meaning us,
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.000]   "He wants them to learn how to walk
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.720]   "and must therefore take away his hands.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:37.100]   "And if only the will to walk is really there,
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   "he is pleased," get this, "even in their stumbles."
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:49.680]   Guys, for lots of us, it won't be a clean walk home.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.280]   For lots of us, it will be stumbles.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.700]   It's not an easy route back,
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.460]   but here's the thing, the heavy lifting is done by him.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.560]   He's gonna carry you through.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.780]   He's your strength.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:05.800]   He is a rock that you build your hope on.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.240]   He is your strong tower.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.440]   He is your ever-present help in times of need
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.040]   and in times where you don't realize that you have need.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.400]   Even in our stumbles, he will be pleased
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.600]   and he will be with us.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.540]   So God, we come to you this morning
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.540]   and we recognize and are overwhelmed by your grace,
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:32.180]   by your extreme fervent love,
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.180]   by love so extreme that it welcomes in the center.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.740]   It welcomes in those of us who are Christians
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.180]   and who have made such terrible mistakes
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.460]   that we're afraid to come to you.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.100]   It welcomes, it dines with, it reinstates,
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.580]   and it restores us.
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.160]   So Holy Spirit, there are so many lies
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   and so many fears about being judged by God,
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.240]   but to the one who would return,
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:05.900]   there is this truth that your love should cast out our fear,
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.140]   that your love is enough,
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.280]   that the blood of Jesus runs deeper
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.740]   than anything your child or children could do.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:18.280]   And so God, help us not just believe it,
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.620]   but Holy Spirit, would you put that as a seed into our heart
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.060]   and would you keep that soil fertile so this grows in us
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.100]   into a tree of understanding that you want us
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.180]   and you welcome us.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.300]   And no matter what we've done,
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.200]   if the thief on the cross could get in at the last minute,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.500]   it doesn't matter what we've done,
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.800]   if we would turn to you,
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.540]   we will find hope,
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.620]   we will find a father who isn't waiting to beat us,
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.900]   but who is overjoyed.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.060]   God, for those of us who feel distant,
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.260]   who feel like we can't talk to you
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.340]   'cause our sin is so bad,
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.360]   I rebuke that lie.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:00.480]   Holy Spirit, would you come in and speak your truth?
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.700]   Would you remind that light shines best in darkness,
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.060]   that you came not to be served,
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.980]   but to serve us, that those of us who were sick,
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.880]   those of us who were in need of you,
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.580]   that's who you came for.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.860]   Lord, would you open our hearts,
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:22.540]   lead us to that coming to our senses moment
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:26.380]   and give us the courage to turn our hearts,
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:30.000]   our minds, our postures and our will back to you.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.740]   In Jesus' name, amen.
