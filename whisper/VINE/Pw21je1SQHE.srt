1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 It's good to see you guys.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,040
 How is everyone?

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,200
 How are you at home?

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,200
 Yeah.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,700
 You know, I wonder whether you know

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,000
 that what we're doing right here in this moment

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 is the most audacious, provocative, transformative,

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,880
 powerful, creative thing that we could ever do.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,560
 That right now in this moment,

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,920
 there is a power amongst us.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,400
 That there is an authority that's here

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,800
 that has been God created and that is God sustained.

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,320
 That there is a movement in this room

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,080
 of God's purposes and his promises

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,360
 that no force, no demonic entity,

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,720
 that nothing could ever come against

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,920
 to hold it back or to contain it.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,880
 I wonder if you realize that in this moment right now,

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,000
 as we gather together in this physical room

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,400
 and online with all the people that are watching,

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,480
 that we're doing something that has been purchased

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,720
 through the shedding of blood for almost 2000 years.

23
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,680
 That the privilege of gathering in this moment

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,680
 has been forged in the fire of martyrdom and sacrifice.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,800
 That this moment of our gathering together

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,400
 has come through two millennium

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,400
 of the worst political, social, and economic history

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,880
 that you could ever imagine.

29
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,680
 That what we're doing right now

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
 has with it such power and authority

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
 that God had decided it would happen

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,640
 right before the beginning of creation.

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,120
 That it's the reason why Jesus actually came to earth

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,720
 to die on the cross.

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,520
 That it's the reason why the Holy Spirit

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,580
 is at work in the world right now.

37
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,840
 So that when God's people gather together,

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,600
 something shifts and takes place in the world around it.

39
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,960
 I mean, I wonder if you've ever thought

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,320
 that what we can do together is far greater

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,460
 than what we would ever be able to achieve on our own.

42
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,160
 That the Bible would say, "When two or more are gathered,

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,580
 "Jesus is with them."

44
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,520
 Have you ever thought about that?

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,000
 Not when you're on your own.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
 Now we know that when we're on our own,

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,740
 Jesus is with us too, amen?

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,320
 But the Bible has this force,

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,680
 has this suggestion that is audacious

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,520
 that when we gather together,

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,760
 we should come to expect the kingdom of earth

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,240
 on earth as it is in heaven.

53
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,000
 You know, Jesus spoke of what we're doing

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,480
 in this moment as this.

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 He said, "This will be my body on earth."

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,000
 I want you to think about that for a second.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,400
 My body on earth.

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,440
 What that means is if anybody in the world

59
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,320
 wants to know what Jesus is like,

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,560
 wants to see Jesus,

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,920
 wants to understand what Jesus said and did,

62
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,480
 wants to know how to act like Jesus,

63
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,600
 wants to experience something of the power

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,480
 and the authority of Jesus,

65
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,740
 they should go to their local church.

66
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,280
 Like the local church should be the manifestation

67
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
 of the risen Jesus so that when anybody comes

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
 into a gathering like this,

69
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,560
 they should leave with nothing less

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
 than a profound encounter with the risen Jesus.

71
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,120
 That what we get to do here is not just come together

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,380
 and sing some pretty nice songs,

73
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,440
 but we get to model a new humanity to the world.

74
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,720
 That we get to show people what the risen Jesus

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,000
 has done for them.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,760
 And in showing them that,

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,440
 they might have a new and fresh vision for life.

78
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,080
 I'm the only one who's excited about this.

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,920
 Are you with me?

80
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,920
 That this moment is literally world changing.

81
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,640
 So let me ask you again,

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,520
 do you realize that what we're doing right now

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,180
 is the most audacious, provocative, transformative,

84
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,220
 powerful, creative thing that we could ever do?

85
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
 That my friends is the church.

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,960
 It may not always feel like that's the church,

87
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,360
 but that's what Jesus died for.

88
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,920
 And the little bit of passion that I've just tried

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,160
 to describe the church to you this morning

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,120
 is just a fraction of the passion that sat on Paul's heart

91
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,200
 as he penned the letter to the church in Philippi

92
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,200
 that we've come to call Philippians.

93
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,960
 Because Paul was so passionate that a church like it was

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
 in this city of Philippi could come to understand

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,820
 that their public witness of faith

96
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,920
 could have such a profound impact on their society

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,760
 that he writes this letter specifically to inspire them

98
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,040
 that the way in which they live together

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,580
 will model a fresh and new vision for life

100
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,780
 for everybody else.

101
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,160
 Philippians is Paul's most personal and intimate letter

102
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,720
 'cause he loved the church in that city.

103
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,160
 But it was a church that was perhaps

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,100
 out of the whole Greco-Roman empire,

105
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,340
 the one that was under more persecution

106
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,680
 than any other church in the whole of that empire.

107
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,720
 Out of every single church that Paul ever planted,

108
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,840
 the one in Philippi had the hardest yards to walk

109
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,960
 when it came to their relationship

110
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,200
 with the authorities around them.

111
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,920
 And Paul writes this letter to them in prison himself.

112
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,520
 I want you to follow this.

113
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
 Paul's in prison for preaching the gospel,

114
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,740
 writing a letter to a church that is deeply suffering

115
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,880
 for their faith through the oppression

116
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,520
 of the authorities around them.

117
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,720
 And he's writing to them knowing the pain of that.

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,680
 And he writes them and says,

119
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,680
 "I want you to shine like stars in the universe.

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,720
 I want you, despite the suffering

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,420
 that you're experiencing right now,

122
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,880
 to know the deep abiding wonder of living a life

123
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,920
 that's worthy of the gospel."

124
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,560
 See, Paul understood that salvation,

125
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,760
 yes, of course, had an individual impact.

126
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,000
 He wrote and taught a theology of salvation

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,960
 for the individual coming to Christ,

128
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,480
 having this change in our relationship with God individually

129
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
 and that change creating for us an ability

130
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,920
 for us to know eternal life and hope.

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,680
 Paul understood that,

132
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,520
 but in that he always taught beyond just the individual.

133
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,680
 He always taught that if you came to Christ

134
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,120
 as an individual, yes, you might be reconciled to God.

135
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,320
 Yes, you might have this eternal life with you,

136
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,440
 but you need to understand that you're saved

137
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,640
 in order to have a different spirit in you.

138
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,920
 Paul would call it a new creation.

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,080
 And as a different spirit,

140
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,960
 you need to then come and work

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,180
 and live in a different community.

142
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,040
 See, we've been talking here at the Vine this whole year

143
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,720
 about what it is to have a different spirit.

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,880
 And the reason why we're now shifting our focus

145
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,680
 to a seven-week study on the book of Philippians

146
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,440
 is 'cause in this book, we see Paul theologically go,

147
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,920
 if you've got a different spirit,

148
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,200
 then you need to live in a different community,

149
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,320
 that there needs to be a way for you to now live in a way

150
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,240
 where together you do something that's more powerful

151
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,400
 than you would ever do on your own.

152
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,520
 So in April to May, I preached to you

153
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,360
 about what it is to have a different spirit for yourself,

154
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
 what it is for you to live with a different spirit

155
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,240
 in this time of Hong Kong's important history.

156
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,560
 From here until November, I wanna now teach you,

157
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,440
 yes, we've got a different spirit in us,

158
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,280
 but we also need to have a different community.

159
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,720
 We also need to be a different church

160
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,080
 for the hour that we're in, because when we get saved,

161
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
 we don't just get saved

162
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,120
 into a personal relationship with Jesus,

163
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,520
 we get saved into a community called the church.

164
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,760
 And we get saved into this wonderful gift

165
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,440
 of now being able to walk together

166
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,320
 in the profound and provocative and audacious reality

167
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,380
 that we get to show the world what Jesus looks like.

168
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,120
 Are you with me?

169
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,040
 In other words, we're saved to be a part

170
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,500
 of what I like to call an alternative society.

171
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,600
 Not something that's up on a hill

172
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,000
 removed from everything else,

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
 but something planted right in the midst

174
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,960
 of all the other societies of this world

175
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,760
 that gets to model a different way of life.

176
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,400
 Jesus spoke of this alternative society

177
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
 as the kingdom of God.

178
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,160
 Paul writes of it in Philippians as the ecclesia.

179
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,600
 We've come to commonly call it the church.

180
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,400
 What I wanna do over the next seven weeks

181
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,280
 is recapture for us the beautiful, profound vision

182
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,080
 that Paul had for the local church.

183
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,400
 But by focusing in on the book of Philippians,

184
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,240
 as we look at one particular church

185
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,520
 in oppressive Greco-Roman empire,

186
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,840
 I want us to understand that the original vision

187
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,200
 that the New Testament has

188
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,880
 for what the gathering of God's people is and all about

189
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,560
 might have something important to say

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
 to what the gathering might look like

191
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,480
 or need to look like for us in our city of Hong Kong today.

192
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,320
 Are you with me?

193
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,720
 So let me tell you a little bit today about Philippi

194
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,520
 and then about the church that was planted there.

195
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,480
 Philippi as a city was located in the northeast of Greece.

196
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,640
 The map here will show you.

197
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,560
 It's the little city that's at the top of the map there,

198
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,520
 kind of adjacent to a city called Necropolis

199
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,160
 that was a city that eventually got consumed

200
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,360
 within Philippi itself.

201
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,360
 It was founded in 350 BC by the Thassos.

202
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,320
 And soon after they founded the city,

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
 they called on the leader of Macedon at the time,

204
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,880
 his name was Philip II,

205
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,200
 to come and help them to defend their city

206
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,960
 against foreign invaders.

207
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,600
 Soon afterwards, Philip renamed the city after himself,

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,440
 and that city became one of the wealthiest

209
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,880
 that there was in the land at the time,

210
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,320
 largely because it had gold mines in its region,

211
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 and Philip mined the gold and then sold it around the world.

212
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,120
 In 186 BC, the Romans took over the city,

213
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,680
 just like Romans did in those days.

214
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,040
 And they came in, they took that city

215
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,360
 because they saw it as a strategic port

216
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,280
 for trade amongst themselves.

217
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,480
 And from 186 onwards, that city was predominantly Roman

218
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,880
 in its understanding and the way it lived its life.

219
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,520
 In fact, in 43 BC, an important moment happened

220
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,440
 in the Roman Civil War.

221
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,880
 An important battle takes place right in Philippi

222
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,320
 between Octavian on the one side, representing the empire,

223
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,960
 and a bunch of other people on the other side

224
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,120
 who were representing the rebellion against that empire.

225
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,440
 And Octavian has a famous and successful victory over them,

226
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,680
 drives the rebels out of Philippi,

227
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,080
 and Octavian takes his personal kind of authority

228
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,920
 over the city at that time.

229
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,280
 By 31 BC, Octavian does something really important.

230
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,080
 He realizes that he needs to attract wealth

231
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,920
 to come down from Italy to be in Philippi.

232
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,960
 He wants to fill Philippi with a whole bunch of Italians

233
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,800
 who are now living as expats there, essentially.

234
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,040
 And so what Octavian does is something very clever.

235
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,880
 He calls Philippi, he re-names, well, not names it,

236
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,080
 but he reestablishes it as what's known as eis italium.

237
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,760
 What that meant was in Italy.

238
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,800
 So anyone now living in Philippi would have the same rights,

239
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,320
 the same citizenship, would pay the same taxes

240
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
 as if they were actually living in Italy.

241
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,480
 What this meant was if you're a wealthy person in Italy,

242
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,760
 Philippi was a great place for you to come and settle

243
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,840
 to grow your wealth,

244
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,400
 because it would be exactly the same tax district,

245
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,160
 exactly the same laws, exactly the same citizenship status

246
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,720
 as if you'd never left Italy at all.

247
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,640
 And this brilliant move by Octavian

248
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,440
 actually doubled Philippi in its size over the 100 years

249
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,920
 between when he decreed the city to be like that

250
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,840
 to when Paul eventually visits it about 100 years later.

251
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,840
 What's central to Philippi is that move.

252
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,920
 It was a place of Roman citizenship.

253
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,920
 And living in Philippi came with a great sense of pride

254
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,640
 that you were exactly like you were living in Italy itself.

255
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,920
 So the same laws, the same powers, the same tax district,

256
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,400
 not only that, but the same religious fervor.

257
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,600
 And in the Greek Roman empire,

258
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,160
 that religion was towards all the Greek or Roman gods,

259
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,100
 but at the top of that was worship of Caesar.

260
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,640
 This is really important.

261
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,080
 That by the time that Paul arrives in the city,

262
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,560
 emperor worship is the central religion of that city.

263
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
 And they're worshiping Octavian,

264
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,360
 who eventually became known as Caesar Augustus.

265
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,080
 And although he had long died by the time of Paul's presence,

266
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
 the city still revolved around him.

267
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,520
 You can find inscriptions in Philippi that say this,

268
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,320
 "To the worship of Caesar Augustus, our Lord and savior.

269
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,840
 "To Augustus, who is the creator

270
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,280
 "and sustainer of all things.

271
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,280
 "To Augustus, who has and holds all eternal life."

272
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,720
 So I wonder if you could imagine

273
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,120
 what it would have been like for Paul

274
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,240
 to arrive in this city with the gospel in his heart.

275
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,480
 He arrives into a place where the people are worshiping Caesar

276
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,760
 with titles like Lord and savior, sustainer and creator,

277
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,480
 the one who holds eternal life.

278
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,560
 And there's Paul saying, "Hang on a second."

279
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,080
 That this is the very antithesis

280
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,440
 of what the gospel was all about.

281
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,120
 And Paul arrives in the city with this dangerous new idea

282
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,600
 that it's not actually Caesar who is Lord and savior,

283
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,800
 but actually a carpenter from a city called Nazareth.

284
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,920
 That actually the one who is the creator

285
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,160
 and sustainer of all is Jesus, not Caesar Augustus.

286
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,240
 That actually the place where you find your citizenship,

287
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,680
 listen to this, is not Italy, it is heaven.

288
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,240
 And Paul begins to formulate the gospel in his heart

289
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,800
 and he stands dangerously against all of the philosophy

290
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,080
 and the social structures of Philippi at that time.

291
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,160
 Can you get a sense of the courage

292
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,120
 Paul must've had to go there?

293
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,760
 Are you with me still?

294
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,280
 This is all important that you carry with you

295
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,880
 because I wanna talk to you now

296
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
 about the church that he founded there.

297
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,040
 Paul received a vision to go to Philippi

298
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,840
 from the Holy Spirit whilst he was asleep one night.

299
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
 It's called the Macedonian call.

300
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,640
 You can read about it in Acts 15 and 16.

301
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,360
 And he shows up there in about 49 AD.

302
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
 And he goes there and the first person

303
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,280
 he leads to Jesus is a woman.

304
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,960
 Her name is Lydia and he meets her

305
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,240
 just outside the gates of the city by a stream.

306
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,120
 And she's washing and preparing the cloths that she has made.

307
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,040
 She is a merchant in purple cloths.

308
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,920
 And purple cloths in those days were incredibly expensive

309
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,240
 because of the dye that was used to make them.

310
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,200
 So they were only ever purchased by wealthy people,

311
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,320
 likely the people that ruled

312
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,480
 and were over the higher elite classes of the city.

313
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,640
 This was her job.

314
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
 She would have been wealthy herself,

315
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,520
 making wealthy clothes for wealthy people.

316
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,040
 Essentially, she was the Gucci of Philippi.

317
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,880
 Are you with me?

318
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,400
 And he brings her to Jesus.

319
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,920
 He tells her that it's not Augustus who is Lord and Savior,

320
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,440
 that it is this person, Jesus,

321
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,680
 who's died and risen for her

322
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
 so that she could have reconciliation with God

323
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,720
 and know what it is to have the fullness of life.

324
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,080
 And she comes to faith, her whole family,

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,200
 and the church starts in her home.

326
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,480
 Now, this church is an amazing thing.

327
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,960
 It's filled with all different kinds of people.

328
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,200
 There's wealthy and then there's the poor.

329
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,840
 There are free people and there are slaves.

330
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,520
 There are the old and they are the young.

331
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
 And by the time that Paul writes his letter

332
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,800
 to the church in Philippi,

333
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,100
 that church has grown to a tremendous 30 people.

334
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,200
 I know you thought I was gonna say more than that,

335
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,480
 didn't you?

336
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,680
 Isn't it funny how we, when we think about church,

337
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
 especially if you come to the Vine,

338
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,760
 you think of church something like this, you know?

339
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,920
 I don't know, we're 2,000 people over the whole Sunday,

340
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
 something like that in normal times.

341
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,680
 At the moment, we're 1,000 people over the Sunday at 50%.

342
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,320
 It's large, it's big.

343
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,080
 The church that Paul was passionate about,

344
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,320
 the one he was writing to,

345
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
 the one that was struggling under great oppression,

346
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,640
 that church, 30 people in a house,

347
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,920
 slaves and frees, wealthy and poor, young and old together.

348
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,880
 There was no other society or gathering of people

349
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,960
 that looked like this in any other part

350
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,680
 of the Greek or Roman empire.

351
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,840
 It was only in a church where you would get the slave

352
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,240
 and the free to be equal together.

353
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,160
 This is an alternative society planted in the midst.

354
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,640
 And Paul's writing to them with such passion on his heart

355
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
 'cause he's saying,

356
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,020
 "You need to have a witness for Jesus in this time."

357
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,160
 You see, there were two things

358
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
 that were happening for the church.

359
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,920
 You guys all tracking with me?

360
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,720
 Okay, two things were happening with the church.

361
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,380
 Here's the first one, I've already mentioned it,

362
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,760
 extreme persecution.

363
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,680
 Paul understood this persecution

364
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,240
 'cause he had been persecuted himself in Philippi.

365
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,520
 In fact, he had been sent to prison in Philippi.

366
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,360
 It's an amazing story.

367
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
 You can read it later in Acts 16.

368
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,480
 But there's Paul and Silas.

369
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,440
 They're walking through the town one day

370
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,880
 and a slave girl behind them starts to cry out,

371
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,560
 "These are servants of the most high God."

372
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,100
 Now, we're told in scripture

373
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,280
 that she had a demonic spirit in her

374
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,180
 and that men were abusing her with that demonic spirit

375
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,480
 so that she could be a fortune teller and make them money.

376
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,400
 And after two or three days of Paul and Silas walking around

377
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,220
 and having this woman following behind them going,

378
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,040
 "These are the servants of the most high."

379
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,760
 Paul is so annoyed that he turns around

380
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,800
 and he says, "In Jesus' name, be gone."

381
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,240
 And the demon leaves her straight away.

382
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,280
 And because the demon leaves her,

383
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,240
 she's no longer a use to the men

384
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,640
 who are making money out of her,

385
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,240
 which is the complaint that ends up putting Paul

386
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,500
 and Silas in prison.

387
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,600
 Now, I haven't got time for this,

388
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,680
 but can I tell you a story?

389
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,920
 I'm just gonna tell it anyway.

390
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,280
 I've done this myself.

391
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,980
 Yeah, so here's the story.

392
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,260
 I was on the bus once.

393
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,760
 The 962.

394
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,160
 I got on from Central and I was going all the way to Tuen Mun.

395
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,320
 Anyone taking that bus ride?

396
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
 It's a long bus ride.

397
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,800
 It's like an hour and 40 minutes.

398
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,920
 Everybody falls asleep, right?

399
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,160
 Like everybody's there kind of trying

400
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,040
 to mind their own business.

401
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,080
 You know what it's like awkwardly on a public bus.

402
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,360
 We've all got our headphones on.

403
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,720
 We're trying to kind of keep things on our own and whatever.

404
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,000
 Anyway, about 20 minutes into the journey,

405
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,520
 there's this man about three rows in front of me

406
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,400
 who suddenly starts freaking out

407
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,160
 and shouting and screaming.

408
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
 And he's really aggressive.

409
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,980
 And he's talking about how everybody on the bus

410
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,500
 is gonna be taken over by zombies.

411
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,340
 I kid you not.

412
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,660
 And he's really freaking people out.

413
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,900
 And I've had enough experience with demonic manifestations

414
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,860
 in my pastoral life over 20 years

415
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,280
 that I can discern the difference

416
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,940
 between what is maybe a mental health episode

417
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,100
 and what is a demonic thing.

418
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,940
 And I knew straight away this was a demonic manifestation.

419
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,900
 And so as this man is shouting at everybody

420
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,660
 at the top of his lungs about zombies,

421
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,740
 I shout, "In the name of Jesus, be gone."

422
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,220
 And immediately he falls asleep.

423
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,560
 Like straight away.

424
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,620
 It was the most amazing thing.

425
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,420
 And I was like, "Whoa, that was cool."

426
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,580
 (audience laughing)

427
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,620
 The woman next to me was like, "What just happened?"

428
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,980
 And I was like, "Yes, I have no idea."

429
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,380
 Anyway, I told her a little bit about what just happened

430
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,500
 and Jesus and everything.

431
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,460
 And I'd like to say she came to faith.

432
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,420
 I think she left the bus freaked out even more,

433
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,460
 but it was an amazing experience

434
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,980
 of how God breaks in the here and now.

435
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,020
 That our citizenship is in heaven and not here on earth.

436
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,420
 And so here's Paul and Silas.

437
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,300
 They've just done this.

438
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,660
 They get thrown in jail.

439
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,780
 They're in this jail.

440
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,960
 It's an oppressive place,

441
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,420
 but they're singing their hearts out with worship.

442
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,300
 They're rejoicing Jesus so much that they're in chains,

443
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,780
 that an earthquake happens, breaks their chains,

444
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,940
 and they're set free.

445
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,340
 The jailer is so freaked out about it

446
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,460
 that he runs into the room and says,

447
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,700
 "Hang on a sec, if you escape,

448
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,820
 I'm gonna be killed, me and my whole family."

449
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,940
 They lead the jailer to Jesus.

450
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,840
 They take him to the river,

451
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,940
 the same place where they've met Lydia, and baptize him.

452
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,100
 His whole family comes into the church and adds the church,

453
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,580
 and now they're 34.

454
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,220
 This is Paul's work in Philippi.

455
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,420
 It's transformative and miraculous,

456
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,820
 and it's happening small,

457
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,580
 but he still writes to this church.

458
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,060
 And he says, "Don't you realize

459
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,300
 that what you're doing right now

460
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,540
 is the most audacious, provocative, transformative,

461
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,340
 powerful, and creative thing you could ever do?"

462
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,940
 This is the church, and it's alive.

463
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,260
 So there's persecution happening in this church,

464
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,340
 deep persecution,

465
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,220
 because if people believe Jesus in this environment,

466
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,420
 and they worship Jesus over Caesar,

467
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,140
 that's gonna bring them into trouble.

468
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,580
 The second thing that's happening is this.

469
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,160
 This is fascinating to me.

470
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,900
 Divisions are happening in the church.

471
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,620
 Anytime that you find the church

472
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,340
 under pressure from society around it,

473
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,740
 you're always gonna find that church

474
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,740
 become more and more divided.

475
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,180
 Always seems to be the way that disunity grows

476
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,100
 when there seems to be pressure from without.

477
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,020
 And in Philippi,

478
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,540
 just a small little church of 30-plus people,

479
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,100
 division starts to happen.

480
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,940
 And in Philippians,

481
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,580
 Paul writes to the different leaders

482
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,060
 of these different factions,

483
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,620
 and he says to them, "What are you doing?

484
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,620
 Why are you going like this?

485
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,700
 You are part of the body of Christ,

486
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,900
 and you might have different opinions

487
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,300
 about stuff that's happening in the world around you,

488
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,220
 but you are united by one spirit,

489
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,020
 that no matter what differences of opinion you might have,

490
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,380
 there is the Spirit of God at work in you,

491
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,860
 and that draws you together."

492
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,860
 So you've got a church that is suffering

493
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,940
 under an increasing amount of persecution,

494
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,660
 and you've got a church, because of that,

495
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,300
 that is finding itself divided politically.

496
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,540
 I wonder if Philippi reminds you of something.

497
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,220
 Are you with me?

498
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,300
 - Yes.

499
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,500
 - This is why I wanna take seven weeks to say,

500
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,100
 well, what did Paul say to this group of people?

501
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,100
 Because perhaps what Paul said to them

502
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,940
 might have something important to say to us

503
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,660
 in this hour of Hong Kong that we find ourselves in.

504
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,540
 I think we need to recapture the vision

505
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,620
 of the provocative, audacious, powerful, transformative,

506
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,300
 comforting, healing, renewing thing that is the church.

507
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,580
 So here's how Paul does it.

508
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,940
 Is this interesting, by the way, so far?

509
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,060
 We got seven weeks of this,

510
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,540
 so it better be interesting for you,

511
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,420
 otherwise I'm gonna have to tell

512
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,020
 more public transport stories to keep you awake.

513
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,660
 But let me break down Philippians.

514
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,540
 The letter was written as one letter by Paul.

515
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,500
 We broke it into four chapters

516
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,260
 when we put it together for the Bible,

517
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,380
 but those chapters help the flow of Paul's argument.

518
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,620
 So let me show you what Paul's argument is.

519
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,340
 Chapter one, he basically says this,

520
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,420
 "The gospel, despite our assumptions and fears,

521
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,340
 "is unstoppable.

522
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,420
 "It is like a rushing river,

523
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,820
 "unimpeded by persecution chains or human leaders."

524
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,140
 Can I have an amen?

525
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,340
 Here's the second chapter.

526
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,700
 The story of Jesus Christ guides the way

527
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,820
 to what it means to live a victorious life,

528
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,300
 a life that we can be empowered to live

529
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,020
 before a watching world.

530
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,100
 You see, for Paul,

531
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,860
 the church was never supposed to be a private thing.

532
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,620
 It was always a public thing that shows the world

533
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,220
 something about Jesus.

534
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,060
 Chapter three, "The gospel demands a complete transformation

535
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,980
 "towards a crucified life in Jesus.

536
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,500
 "The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus

537
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,700
 "is our model and path."

538
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,100
 In other words, if we wanna be a public expression,

539
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,540
 it can't be of our politics.

540
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,300
 It can't be of just what we think we believe.

541
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
 It can't be of our whatever it might be.

542
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,060
 It has to be the cruciform life in Jesus.

543
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,260
 In other words, it's about Jesus.

544
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,100
 It's about Jesus.

545
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,660
 It's about Jesus.

546
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,300
 And the more that we come to understand

547
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,060
 the death and resurrection of Jesus,

548
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,260
 the better we are representatives of his body on earth.

549
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,540
 And then in chapter four, he says,

550
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,860
 "The God of the gospel is a God of peace and glory.

551
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,340
 "While we may face many trials,

552
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,340
 "we live in joy, thanksgiving, and hope."

553
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,340
 Like if you truly believe that he is the one

554
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,260
 who brings a gospel that's unstoppable,

555
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,380
 I mean, if you truly believe

556
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,020
 that that gospel is centered on Jesus Christ,

557
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,180
 that we can live in a way before the watching world

558
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,660
 that says something about Jesus,

559
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,940
 if we center ourselves in his death and resurrection,

560
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,380
 then despite what might be happening around us,

561
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,900
 we can know joy.

562
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,940
 Paul's in prison as he writes to a church

563
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,060
 that feel like they're in prison.

564
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,140
 And he's saying to them,

565
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,380
 "Even in your midst of what you're going through right now,

566
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,540
 "you can know joy."

567
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,100
 Because joy is not based on circumstance.

568
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,180
 Joy is based on a person, and his name is Jesus.

569
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,620
 So let me show you, as I draw to a close,

570
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,140
 I'm sure you're happy to hear.

571
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,260
 Let me read to you the central passage of Philippians.

572
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,540
 It's found in Philippians 1, verses 27 to 29.

573
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,100
 But it's the central thesis that he has for the whole book.

574
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,460
 Let me read this to us.

575
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,540
 "Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner

576
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,500
 "worthy of the gospel of Christ.

577
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,540
 "Then, whether I come to see you

578
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,180
 "or only hear about you in my absence,

579
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,980
 "I will know that you stand firm in one spirit,

580
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,420
 "contending together for the faith of the gospel,

581
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,260
 "without being frightened in any way

582
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,780
 "by those who oppose you.

583
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,500
 "This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed,

584
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,980
 "but that you will be saved, and that by God.

585
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,660
 "For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ,

586
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,660
 "not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him."

587
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,180
 This is Paul in his most gracious and loving,

588
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,780
 and in his most sobering and challenging.

589
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,220
 I wanna break this down for you real quick.

590
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,140
 Notice how he starts.

591
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,020
 It's the gospel of Jesus.

592
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,740
 It's all about Jesus, the good news of his life,

593
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,100
 death, and resurrection.

594
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,780
 And in the gospel, we can stand firm.

595
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,900
 He wants the church to stand firm.

596
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,180
 He doesn't want the church to wilter under the pressure.

597
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,660
 He doesn't want the church to believe every wind of teaching.

598
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,860
 It's the gospel, and only the gospel,

599
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,580
 and we stand rooted on that.

600
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,740
 Jesus would say, "That's like building your house on a rock."

601
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,660
 Building your house on a rock,

602
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,620
 not building your house on sand.

603
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,140
 So we as a church are to stand firm together on the gospel.

604
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,020
 He says this, "So you strive together as one."

605
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,740
 I don't want divisions amongst you,

606
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,660
 Paul's writing to the church.

607
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,280
 Like if you're divided, you will fall.

608
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,980
 Like you've gotta be united together,

609
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,500
 and the way you get united together,

610
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,060
 know that there's one spirit.

611
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,820
 One spirit that you worship,

612
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,420
 not a bunch of different spirits.

613
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,580
 There's one gospel, one Jesus, one spirit.

614
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,020
 And the oneness of God is the entry place

615
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,820
 to your oneness together.

616
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,340
 And in your oneness together,

617
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,820
 you're then able not to be frightened in any way

618
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,420
 by those who will oppose you.

619
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,200
 Paul is honest with the church.

620
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,680
 There are going to be people that will oppose you

621
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,540
 if you stand for Jesus over and above everything else.

622
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,460
 'Cause it will jar up at some point

623
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,100
 against the rest of the philosophies

624
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,220
 and ideas of the world.

625
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,840
 And because of that, that opposition is gonna come,

626
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,980
 but you don't need to fear the opposition.

627
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,820
 Why?

628
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,440
 Because you're not alone, you're together.

629
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,500
 Because you're united with one spirit.

630
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,700
 And with one spirit,

631
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,820
 you can walk forward with courage in this time.

632
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,260
 He then says this,

633
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,260
 "So that you may have to be prepared to suffer for him."

634
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:02,140
 This is strong, personal, real.

635
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,900
 Because Paul is in chains writing this

636
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,880
 to a church that knows what it is to suffer.

637
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
 But he says, "You don't do it alone.

638
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,880
 You do it on the gospel.

639
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,240
 You do it united together by one spirit.

640
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,680
 So you don't have to fear whatever happens to you.

641
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,640
 I'm in chains, but I am rejoicing

642
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,740
 because we're living a life that's worthy of the gospel."

643
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,880
 And that's what he says right here at the start.

644
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,520
 He uses this word, "Conduct yourself."

645
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,380
 Very quickly, in the Greek,

646
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,520
 this word is the word, "Politiomi."

647
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,040
 "Politiomi" is a Greek word

648
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,160
 by which we get our common English words,

649
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,480
 political and politics.

650
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,320
 That also comes from the Latin word of "polis,"

651
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,880
 which means for the people.

652
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,240
 "Politiomi" is only used by Paul in two occurrences

653
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,080
 in the whole of the New Testament.

654
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,400
 And both of those occurrences are in the book of Philippians

655
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,160
 here and in chapter three.

656
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,880
 Essentially, what the word means is this,

657
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
 to be a citizen

658
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,800
 or to administer the civil affairs of something.

659
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,760
 Now, I wonder why Paul uses a political word

660
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,440
 about citizenship and puts it into the letter

661
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,240
 to a church based in Philippi.

662
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,840
 Based on everything that I've said so far,

663
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,920
 do you understand why he's doing that?

664
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,400
 'Cause remember what I said right at the start.

665
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,280
 Philippi was a city proud about its citizenship,

666
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,600
 that it worshiped Caesar Augustus as Lord and Savior,

667
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,960
 and it enjoyed the same citizenship

668
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,000
 as everything in Italy.

669
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,680
 Paul writes to them and says,

670
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,160
 "The way you are to live as a church

671
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,280
 is to politiomi around Jesus Christ,

672
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,520
 to have Him as the main force of your life

673
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,160
 so that your citizenship is on behalf of the gospel,

674
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,280
 not on behalf of some world system.

675
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,960
 Your citizenship is heaven,

676
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,600
 and it's not something that you would discover

677
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
 or find on earth."

678
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,640
 He's writing to a bunch of people

679
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,160
 that are being persecuted,

680
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,040
 and he's saying to them,

681
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,840
 "The ultimate place that you find your freedom

682
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,720
 and your allegiance and your citizenship is not Italy,

683
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
 it's not Rome, it's Jesus."

684
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,680
 This is dangerous stuff.

685
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,880
 But Paul is doing this,

686
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,280
 not because he's trying to stir up some rebellion

687
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,560
 amongst his people.

688
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,280
 It's really important you hear me say this.

689
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,480
 Paul is not trying to stir up anarchy

690
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,640
 amongst the church in the society.

691
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,280
 He's not trying to get his church to rebel against society.

692
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,000
 What he's doing is saying this,

693
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,120
 "When it ultimately comes down to it, you have a choice.

694
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000
 Is your allegiance primarily gonna be to Jesus,

695
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,400
 or is it gonna be to Caesar?

696
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,440
 There will be a time that if you believe

697
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,640
 in the gospel of Jesus Christ,

698
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,600
 then that gospel will at some point

699
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,680
 bring you into opposition with the other philosophies

700
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,200
 and ideologies of your age.

701
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,320
 And when it does, you're likely to suffer for it.

702
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,520
 And in that suffering, you have a choice.

703
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,440
 Will you be a citizen of heaven,

704
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,280
 or will you be a citizen of earth?"

705
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,800
 He's saying to them

706
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:57,120
 that you are to administer your civil affairs today

707
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,120
 in society as if you were actually already living in heaven.

708
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,360
 That like you're on a bus and someone's manifesting a demon,

709
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,840
 you cast that demon out.

710
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,560
 Another way of writing Philippians 1:27 would be this.

711
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,360
 Go back one.

712
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,680
 "Whatever happens in life,

713
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,360
 you are to administer together your civic affairs

714
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
 in a manny worthy of the good news of Jesus."

715
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,560
 Could you imagine that?

716
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,120
 That we would administer our civil affairs.

717
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,240
 In other words, the things that we do as a church in public

718
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,080
 in a way that brings honor and glory to the gospel,

719
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,760
 in a way that enables us as a church

720
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,280
 to stand strong and stand firm, not in rebellion.

721
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,800
 This is the same Paul that writes to the church in Rome

722
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,960
 and says that governments are instructed

723
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,680
 and put there by God's spirit,

724
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,720
 that we are to give, as Jesus would say,

725
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
 to Caesar what is Caesar.

726
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
 This is the same Paul.

727
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,280
 He's not calling for rebellion,

728
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,440
 but he is calling for an allegiance to Jesus.

729
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,040
 And he is saying that in that allegiance,

730
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,200
 you have to be prepared that it might bring you up

731
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,720
 against things that oppose it.

732
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,200
 Will we stand firm?

733
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,600
 I think that's a great challenge for the church in Hong Kong

734
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,560
 in the years ahead.

735
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,680
 And I think alone, I'm freaking out.

736
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,000
 Together, we stand united.

737
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,920
 We stand with one spirit, an alternative society,

738
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,800
 the kingdom of God, the ecclesia, the church,

739
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,160
 believing that with the gospel held forth,

740
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,440
 we could shine like stars in the universe.

741
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
 With the gospel held forth,

742
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,400
 we could see many people come

743
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,800
 into the saving knowledge of Jesus.

744
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,440
 With the gospel held forth,

745
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,500
 we could together begin to model something of what it is

746
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,640
 to see the glory of God on earth.

747
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,480
 Why?

748
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,400
 So that we get some great holy huddle on a Sunday?

749
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,680
 No, so that many who are lost

750
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,000
 would find their Lord and savior.

751
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,440
 Not Caesar, Jesus Christ.

752
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,680
 Can we stand together?

753
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
 I wanna pray for us.

754
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,700
 As we pray, I want to read that passage in Philippians,

755
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,960
 but from the message version,

756
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,160
 as I think it says something critical for us as we pray.

757
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,080
 So stand united, Vine Church, singular in vision,

758
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,520
 contending for people's trust in the message, the good news,

759
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,240
 not flinching or dodging in the slightest before opposition.

760
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,800
 For your courage and unity, Vine Church,

761
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,720
 will show them what they're up against.

762
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,720
 Defeat for them, victory for you, and both because of God.

763
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,320
 For there is far more to this life than trusting in Christ.

764
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,960
 There's also suffering for him.

765
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,740
 And the suffering is as much a gift as the trusting.

766
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,960
 As we lean into that thought over the next seven weeks,

767
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,580
 can we pray?

768
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,900
 Father, we stand now together.

769
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,080
 We stand, Lord, as a church, like the church in Philippi,

770
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,800
 broken at times, bruised.

771
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,740
 A church where we know in the last couple of years,

772
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,640
 there've been divisions and factions,

773
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,280
 differences of opinion that have driven wedges

774
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
 between people and relationships,

775
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,760
 between leaders and congregations

776
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,320
 and congregations and leaders.

777
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,080
 Father, we know that we're standing in a time

778
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,080
 and in an hour that much like the church in Philippi,

779
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,580
 was a challenge to the gospel.

780
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,000
 But Lord, just as we see Paul write

781
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,780
 to the church in Philippi, that the gospel is unstoppable.

782
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,400
 I pray that as we open up this book

783
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
 over the next seven weeks,

784
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,120
 we as a church would recapture that grand vision,

785
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,280
 that the church is able to show the world

786
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,120
 a new and fresh vision for life.

787
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,560
 One where those who are divided

788
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,680
 can come together in unity again.

789
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,060
 One where those that have their own challenges

790
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,340
 can find in unity with others,

791
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,680
 the grace to see those challenges overcome.

792
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,160
 A church that is the most audacious,

793
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,920
 provocative, transformative, powerful,

794
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,160
 creative thing that there is on earth.

795
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,140
 Because together we are the body of Christ.

796
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,840
 Lord, I pray for the body of Christ here at the Vine.

797
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,000
 I pray Lord that this would be a shifting time

798
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,040
 for us in this season of this particular series.

799
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,460
 I pray that over the next seven weeks,

800
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,880
 you would install into us a fresh passion

801
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,680
 for one another again.

802
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,280
 That we would look across the aisles and across the rows

803
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,440
 and have a desire to be in community with one another.

804
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,680
 That we would do all that we can to contend for the gospel.

805
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,840
 That we would do what we can in this hour of our city

806
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,080
 to live a life that's worthy of the gospel.

807
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:54,920
 That we would do so not to be rebellious,

808
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,560
 we would do so because we are citizens of heaven,

809
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,840
 given this great gift, this peace and this joy

810
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,640
 that comes upon us in the lightness of your gospel.

811
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,120
 And that in that we can walk forward

812
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,360
 with courage and hope.

813
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,800
 That even in moments of struggle and strife and suffering,

814
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,700
 we can sing praises of joy.

815
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,600
 Lord, I pray that your vision for church

816
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,860
 would come and capture our hearts again.

817
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,360
 And that Lord, you would strengthen us

818
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,820
 and strengthen your church across this city

819
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,680
 to bring the gospel more and more

820
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,820
 to a city that so desperately needs it.

821
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,880
 Lord, would you do that amongst us in these seven weeks,

822
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,340
 we pray in Jesus' name.

823
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,560
 Everyone says, amen.

824
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,000
 Can we just close in a little bit of worship now together?
