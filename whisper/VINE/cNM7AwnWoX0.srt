1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
 Have you ever noticed how there are different seasons in your life?

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,200
 If you look back,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,680
 you can see those seasons where things were flourishing

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,800
 and there was a good harvest.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,480
 Or maybe there was a time

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,200
 where it felt like the ground was very tough and frozen,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,080
 and you had to dig very hard to plant anything.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,440
 Maybe it felt like everything was going wrong,

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,200
 or you lost someone special.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,480
 In my experience, you cannot have one season without the other.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,480
 The things that you learn in the tough seasons

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,360
 shape and mold you for the easier seasons.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,600
 But in every season of life,

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,200
 God is with us, helping us, leading us,

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,400
 watching over us, and keeping us.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,080
 It's always good to take time to stop

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,480
 and take stock of where we are in life.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,240
 It helps us to gain perspective,

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,080
 and I have found that it grows my faith for the future.

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,280
 I think we can all agree that the past three years in Hong Kong

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,200
 have been challenging.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,960
 But through it all, God has been faithful.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,200
 Amen?

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,560
 Perhaps you remember last year

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,600
 when Pastor Promise preached about Caleb following God wholeheartedly.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,720
 If you haven't heard that, I recommend that you listen to it.

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,320
 God asked me if I would follow him wholeheartedly to Portugal.

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,720
 My husband, Graham, and I had been talking about

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,320
 where we would go in the future,

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,520
 and I was thinking 20 years' time.

31
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,600
 But God moved the timetable forward,

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,800
 and we will be relocating very soon.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,480
 As I reflect over our time in Hong Kong and at the Vine,

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,480
 I can see how God has been working faithfully for our good.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
 He has always guided us gently

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,760
 and has often given us time to prepare,

37
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,240
 but not always.

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,880
 He has given me different assignments for different seasons.

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,360
 You may not have heard this language

40
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,560
 of God giving you an assignment before.

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,120
 It's simply what God is asking you to do

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,560
 for a season in your life.

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,600
 My prayer for our time together today

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,160
 is that you will have your assignment confirmed,

45
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,560
 or if you didn't know what an assignment was before,

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,280
 you will discover what God's assignment for you is.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,200
 As Pastor Jeff was saying last week,

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,760
 our vocation is an all-of-life calling,

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,480
 and not just about our careers or our profession.

50
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,160
 In the same way, God's assignment for you

51
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,280
 is for all areas of your life,

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,040
 your work, your rest, your family,

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,160
 and when you have time to play.

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 It's amazing to see how God works in every area of our lives

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,280
 and how he is the one helper we can rely on.

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,400
 Moving to Portugal is a very difficult step for me,

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,760
 and to be honest, I am struggling to be obedient,

58
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,680
 but as Emma says, obedience is God's love language.

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,920
 I have been sitting in Psalm 121

60
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,840
 since the fast finished in January,

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,320
 and my constant prayer has been,

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
 "Help me, Lord," because he is our helper.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,200
 By sitting in Psalm 121,

64
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,440
 I mean that I have been reading it,

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,560
 praying it through, journaling about it,

66
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,600
 pondering about it,

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,920
 and allowing it to soak deep into my soul.

68
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
 It has been a source of strength and comfort for me.

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,880
 So let's take a look at Psalm 121 together.

70
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,720
 A song of ascents.

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,280
 I lift up my eyes to the mountains.

72
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,600
 Where does my help come from?

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,000
 My help comes from the Lord.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,080
 The Maker of heaven and earth.

75
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,160
 He will not let your foot slip.

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,760
 He who watches over you will not slumber.

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,880
 Indeed, he who watches over Israel

78
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,640
 will neither slumber nor sleep.

79
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,400
 The Lord watches over you.

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,960
 The Lord is your shade at your right hand.

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,520
 The shade at your right hand.

82
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,440
 The sun will not harm you by day,

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
 nor the moon by night.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,200
 The Lord will keep you from all harm.

85
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,400
 He will watch over your life.

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,560
 The Lord will watch over your coming and going,

87
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,000
 both now and forevermore.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,720
 Amen.

89
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,200
 Let's unpack the poem together.

90
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,360
 Psalm 121 was written in the time

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,320
 when Israel was in exile in Babylon.

92
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,560
 There was a long distance and a desert

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,560
 between where they were in Babylon and to Jerusalem.

94
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,960
 And a mountain range separated the two lands.

95
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,160
 Let's imagine that we're on the journey together

96
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,280
 and think about how the different parts

97
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,360
 of the Psalm would apply.

98
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,040
 I lift up my eyes to the hills

99
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,640
 was a reference to the mountain range

100
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,360
 between Babylon and Jerusalem.

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,320
 And the idea that Jerusalem sat just over

102
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,440
 the other side of the hill.

103
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,360
 The city was out of sight, but not out of mind.

104
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,520
 Where does my help come from

105
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,120
 echoes the need that they have for help

106
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,360
 because they're in captivity in Babylon

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,760
 and want to be released to go back to Jerusalem.

108
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,440
 But it is also a statement that help won't come from war,

109
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,960
 from Israel fighting or taking up arms.

110
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,280
 The help to get back to Jerusalem can only come from God,

111
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,200
 the maker of heaven and earth.

112
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,680
 He will not let your foot slip is a reference

113
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,880
 to the hard journey of hiking over the mountain range

114
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,960
 back to Jerusalem, a treacherous journey

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,800
 where they could easily slip and fall.

116
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,960
 The shade at your right hand was important

117
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
 because the right hand was the part of the body

118
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,160
 used for holding a sword.

119
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,520
 And in the left, they held a shield.

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,520
 What the poem is saying is that God protects his people,

121
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,160
 shading them on the right side

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,080
 so they can be most effective in life.

123
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,520
 God shades us and protects us so we can move forward

124
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,880
 and face whatever circumstances come towards us.

125
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:26,560
 Finally, the poem is a song of ascent.

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
 It is the second Psalm in the 15 songs of ascent,

127
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,160
 which means that it was eventually used

128
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,800
 in the religious festivals in Jerusalem

129
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,840
 in the second temple period

130
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,880
 after Israel returned from exile, just as God said.

131
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,720
 It was especially sung as pilgrims are walking

132
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,800
 up the hill of Mount Zion towards the temple,

133
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,560
 which stood on the hill.

134
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,640
 I have heard the songs of ascent referred to

135
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,720
 as pilgrim songs.

136
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,320
 I like that imagery because we are all on a journey together

137
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,760
 which is why our community is so important.

138
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:15,120
 I've been struck recently by how active God is in this Psalm.

139
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,360
 We can see that he helps us in verse two.

140
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 He watches over us in verses three to five and seven to eight

141
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,520
 and he keeps us safe in verse seven.

142
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,640
 Knowing that God is so active has been very encouraging

143
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,400
 to me over the past few months

144
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,520
 when things have been very uncertain

145
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,640
 as we've moved towards moving to Portugal.

146
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,800
 As we often sing, even when I don't see it, you're working.

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,080
 Even when I don't feel it, you're working.

148
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,880
 Let me tell you about our journey to Hong Kong,

149
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,720
 how I discovered my assignments

150
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,120
 and the ways that God has been faithful

151
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
 whilst we've been here in Asia.

152
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,440
 God gave me my first assignment when I was 12.

153
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,600
 I read Jackie Pullinger's book, "Chasing the Dragon".

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
 Maybe some of you have read it.

155
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,280
 To be honest, it terrified me.

156
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 God told me then that I would serve him in Hong Kong

157
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,960
 and I was very worried about that

158
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
 because I did not like the idea

159
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,480
 of working with scary drug addicts,

160
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,400
 even if Holy Spirit was involved.

161
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,240
 So I forgot all about it.

162
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,600
 It was only after we'd moved to Hong Kong

163
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,080
 and Jackie came to preach at the Vine

164
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,080
 that I remembered what God had said to me when I was 12,

165
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,200
 even though I had forgotten.

166
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,600
 God had not and I have served him in Hong Kong.

167
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,080
 The next assignment that I remember was in June 2006

168
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,400
 when Graham and I were living in England.

169
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,240
 I was a teacher at the time

170
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
 and was very involved with my church.

171
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,880
 Graham was asked to move to Hong Kong by his company.

172
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,560
 In the August, I felt that God had confirmed

173
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,160
 that he was calling us to Hong Kong in many ways,

174
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,360
 one of them being that there was a typo

175
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,840
 in my teaching contract.

176
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,040
 So instead of needing to give one year's notice,

177
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,160
 I only needed to give one term's notice

178
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,600
 and that felt huge at the time.

179
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,760
 I resigned from my teaching job in August,

180
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,480
 but then we did not hear any details

181
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 about Hong Kong in September or October or November.

182
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 And then in the middle of December,

183
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,600
 we were told that we needed to be in Hong Kong

184
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,240
 on the 4th of January.

185
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,400
 If God hadn't confirmed the assignment

186
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,600
 and told us to prepare,

187
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,400
 we had not have been able to move

188
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,760
 and arrive in Hong Kong on time.

189
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,920
 God truly was our helper, as it says in verse one,

190
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
 as we worked through all of the things

191
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,720
 that were necessary to move continents.

192
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,320
 Two months later, I slipped my L5-S1 disc in my back

193
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,280
 and it herniated and it caused nerve damage

194
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,920
 in my right leg.

195
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,560
 So I now walk on a leg that my brain tells me is not there.

196
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
 And that has been really helpful for me

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
 not to believe everything I think

198
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
 because we know that our minds and our thoughts

199
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,560
 can sometimes lead us astray, don't we?

200
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,600
 While I was learning to walk with a stick,

201
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,200
 I was aware that my next assignment

202
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
 was to get more involved at the Vine,

203
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,760
 but I didn't know how or when.

204
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,480
 I'd been taught by my pastor, Rob, in England,

205
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,440
 not to move until God said.

206
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,200
 So I was trying to wait patiently

207
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,320
 for God to tell me to move.

208
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,720
 Two months later in May,

209
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,400
 a publicity postcard from GOD, Goods of Desire,

210
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,600
 was pushed under the door of our apartment,

211
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,240
 which I now know is very rare in Hong Kong.

212
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,400
 The postcard said, "Delay no more."

213
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,240
 Now I understand that in Cantonese,

214
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,960
 there is another meaning.

215
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,280
 But at that time,

216
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,840
 I took that to be a signpost to contact the Vine.

217
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,360
 So I sent an email.

218
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,200
 I started volunteering in the office the next day.

219
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,320
 And I now know that God can use many and varied things

220
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,400
 to help us to discover an assignment.

221
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,160
 During that summer, I was asked to help

222
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,000
 with some of our refugees and asylum seekers,

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
 who numbered about 30 at the time.

224
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,880
 It's been amazing to see how God has grown that community

225
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,520
 to become road and arise.

226
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,320
 Many of our brothers and sisters in this community

227
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,560
 have amazing stories of God's faithfulness.

228
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
 And I really encourage you to get to know them

229
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,960
 and hear some of their stories.

230
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
 It will encourage you.

231
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,040
 Shortly after this, I met Marina,

232
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,280
 who we said goodbye to last year.

233
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,280
 And I got to know some of our Filipina sisters.

234
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,720
 It has been a huge privilege to serve and learn so much

235
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,480
 from our Filipino community.

236
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,000
 Our brothers and sisters there, whom we now call Philcom.

237
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,840
 They know how important it is to pray

238
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,280
 and that God answers our prayers in many and varied ways.

239
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,640
 In 2010, I had an ectopic pregnancy,

240
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,400
 which caused very serious medical complications

241
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,560
 and it took me about a year to recover from it.

242
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,480
 I know that during that time, God was watching me.

243
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,360
 And I know that he did not slumber or sleep

244
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,920
 during that really difficult time, as it says in verse four.

245
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,760
 It was during that time that God gave me another assignment,

246
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,080
 to pray and sing.

247
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,080
 This assignment really helped me to discern

248
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,360
 what I should say yes to

249
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,120
 and what I should say no to more easily.

250
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:01,160
 The next year, the Vine moved from Central to Wanchai,

251
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,560
 to Vine Center 2, where we are now.

252
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,440
 I still have a wow moment whenever I enter this building,

253
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,920
 as I remember what it used to look like

254
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,280
 and how God changed it from a dilapidated building

255
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,720
 that was not used very much,

256
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,160
 to the 24/7 ministry space, pandemic excluded,

257
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,720
 that we have today.

258
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,120
 Every time I step into this auditorium,

259
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,360
 I'm reminded about God's faithfulness

260
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,640
 and that if he says he will do something, he will do it.

261
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,000
 Over the years, this assignment to pray and sing

262
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,120
 developed into praying and walking with women

263
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,320
 and more involvement with the worship team.

264
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,480
 During this time, I went to New Zealand

265
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,920
 to attend my friend Sharon's wedding

266
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,120
 and the day after, I was sitting in her church,

267
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,960
 minding my own business,

268
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,680
 when halfway through the sermon,

269
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,280
 her pastor stopped and went, "You!"

270
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,800
 He looked directly at me

271
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,600
 and he said that God had given me a gift of healing

272
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,840
 and that he would use me to bring healing to many people.

273
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:23,840
 Then in 2016, I discerned with my spiritual friend Julie

274
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,600
 that God was changing my assignment from pray and sing

275
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,400
 to love God, love people.

276
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,680
 As I look back, I can see how all my experiences in England

277
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,200
 and at The Vine to that point

278
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,680
 were my training grounds for this assignment

279
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,920
 and my current role at The Vine.

280
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,520
 God never wastes anything.

281
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,520
 He has used the gifts he gave me in various ways.

282
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,520
 He has used my teaching gift in Arise and Philcom and Tribe.

283
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,240
 He's used my healing gift with many people in Hong Kong.

284
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,280
 He's shown me how loving God and loving people

285
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 can be inspiring, challenging, frustrating,

286
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,800
 and a huge privilege.

287
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:29,160
 He has also shown me that ASAP stands for something

288
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,040
 other than as soon as possible.

289
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,680
 He's shown me that it also stands for always stop and pray.

290
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:47,360
 I was expecting to be at The Vine

291
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,040
 and in Hong Kong for another 20 years,

292
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,800
 but as you know, that was not God's plan.

293
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,080
 Our belongings are in a container

294
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,720
 somewhere between here and Rotterdam.

295
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,360
 Our visa application has been accepted,

296
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,200
 but we don't know if we will be given a visa

297
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,040
 or when we will be able to fly to Portugal.

298
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,040
 But as we've seen in the past,

299
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,520
 God has been faithful and I know

300
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,640
 he will be faithful in the future.

301
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:28,040
 As Graham and I come to the end of our time in Hong Kong,

302
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,560
 God has given me a new assignment for Portugal.

303
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,640
 It is be a sheep.

304
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,880
 I do not know what that looks like yet,

305
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,680
 but God knows that I will be a sheep.

306
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,080
 But God knows me well and I think he's encouraging me

307
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,600
 not to jump in straight away in a new church,

308
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 but to rest and spend time with the shepherd first.

309
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,720
 I expect that I will spend time sitting in Psalm 23

310
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,960
 when we go to Portugal later.

311
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:11,760
 You may be asking, how do I discern an assignment?

312
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,600
 When you are discerning an assignment,

313
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,760
 remember, only you can be you.

314
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 God has created you for a purpose.

315
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,600
 He will lead you to where your specific gifts,

316
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,720
 talents and character

317
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,120
 will help him to work his purposes out.

318
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,640
 Spend time with God in prayer

319
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,880
 and ask him to show you what your assignment is.

320
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,000
 Then check you've heard God right

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,040
 by talking to your spiritual friend or your community group.

322
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:06,640
 Another way is what I call God incidences.

323
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,280
 It's my play on the word coincidence.

324
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:20,480
 And it means chance or luck, but I don't believe in those.

325
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,040
 I believe that God is at work in my life and your life

326
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,280
 and he can arrange for things to happen.

327
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,040
 Remember the postcard under our apartment door?

328
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,600
 Another way is what I call the rule of three.

329
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:47,040
 I don't know about you, but sometimes I'm a little slow

330
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,000
 to work out that God's talking to me.

331
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,440
 But he is so kind.

332
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,960
 He often says something three or more, if I need it,

333
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,560
 times in different ways.

334
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,440
 Perhaps the first way is in my daily devotion.

335
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,440
 Then perhaps someone might mention the same thing

336
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,680
 in a conversation I'm having.

337
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,880
 And then maybe the preacher,

338
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,800
 usually our wonderful senior pastor, Andrew,

339
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,680
 will mention the same thing in a sermon.

340
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,840
 By that point, I usually realize

341
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,480
 God is drawing my attention to something.

342
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,000
 Then we have plus, minus, and interesting.

343
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,200
 This is when I'm trying to make a decision about something.

344
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,760
 I have three boxes in my head.

345
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 Again, I'm on the lookout for ways

346
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,480
 that God might be speaking.

347
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,240
 He may use something a friend says, sermons,

348
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,680
 daily devotion, something we discuss in community group,

349
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,240
 a song on the radio, a billboard on an advert.

350
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,560
 God speaks in myriad ways.

351
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,920
 If it is something that seems to confirm

352
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,360
 that I should be doing that thing,

353
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,520
 I put it in the plus box in my head.

354
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,520
 Then if I notice something that seems to confirm

355
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 that I shouldn't be doing something,

356
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,400
 I put it in the minus box in my head.

357
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,600
 But then sometimes something happens

358
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,360
 and it just doesn't fit neatly into the plus or the minus.

359
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 So that's when it goes in the interesting box.

360
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,760
 And I discern with my spiritual friend, Julie,

361
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,000
 what that could mean.

362
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,160
 And then finally, we have when you just know in your knower.

363
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:59,920
 As we grow closer to God,

364
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,160
 the Holy Spirit becomes a larger part in our lives.

365
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,560
 And we are able to discern how to think or speak

366
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,200
 or act in different situations.

367
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,880
 And we often act differently than we would have done before.

368
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:22,240
 You may meet someone and you just know

369
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,840
 that God wants you to help them

370
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,960
 or encourage them or something else.

371
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,440
 When you know something in your knower,

372
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,280
 you have peace that is the right thing to do.

373
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,920
 But at that moment, you may not know how to do it.

374
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,640
 I'm sorry that this is not a more concrete action point,

375
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,400
 but I really encourage you to spend time

376
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,720
 developing your knower.

377
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,480
 When you discover your assignment,

378
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,560
 ask God what he wants you to be doing.

379
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,560
 Remember to love people and ask yourself and God

380
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,800
 how you can love people well in each situation

381
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,240
 that you are faced with.

382
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,320
 That might be like saying something encouraging

383
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,160
 instead of criticizing someone.

384
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,840
 Or taking a subordinate out for lunch or coffee

385
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,520
 and asking them how they're doing.

386
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,520
 Or making a new friend in our congregation,

387
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
 possibly even the person

388
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,280
 that you're sitting next to right now.

389
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:47,280
 As we've been journeying together this morning,

390
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,800
 have you been sensing what your assignment is?

391
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,240
 God will have one for you,

392
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,680
 whatever stage of life you are in.

393
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,960
 Let's just take some time to reflect.

394
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,080
 If you already have an assignment,

395
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,600
 you might like to spend some time with God

396
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,240
 and review how your assignment is going.

397
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,520
 If it is going well, praise God.

398
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,000
 But if there are areas of struggle,

399
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 and there usually are, ask the helper of Psalm 121

400
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,680
 to help you.

401
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,840
 If you don't have an assignment yet,

402
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,800
 I encourage you to ask God for one.

403
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,040
 Remember that it will be tailor-made for you,

404
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:44,000
 your gifts, your talents, and your character,

405
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,640
 because only you can be you.

406
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,520
 And do you have a spiritual friend

407
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,440
 who could help you to sense and discern the signposts

408
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
 and the assignments in your life?

409
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
 If you don't know what a spiritual friend is,

410
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,800
 you can follow this link to find out more.

411
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,360
 You can also ask God to show you who you could ask.

412
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,040
 That's how I found my spiritual friend, Julie.

413
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
 (silence)

414
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,840
 I'd love it if we could pray together

415
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,600
 with each other about this.

416
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,360
 Shall we stand together to pray?

417
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,080
 (soft music)

418
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:44,440
 Loving God, thank you that you have an assignment

419
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,400
 for each one of us.

420
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,560
 Thank you that you help us with it.

421
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,320
 You watch over us.

422
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,200
 You keep us.

423
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,640
 Help us to know in our knowers

424
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,200
 what it is you are asking us to do.

425
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,800
 And help us to know that whatever you ask us to do,

426
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,560
 you will give us everything that we need to do it.

427
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,640
 (soft music)

428
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,280
 Lord, I pray especially for any one of us

429
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,120
 who don't feel that we're worthy or good enough

430
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,960
 for an assignment from you.

431
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
 Help us to know that as your child, we are worthy

432
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,280
 because you love us.

433
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,440
 And you want us to become more and more

434
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,480
 as you created us to be.

435
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,960
 (soft music)

436
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
 Help us to love you, God.

437
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,040
 Help us to love each other and grow in you.

438
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,560
 In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

439
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,920
