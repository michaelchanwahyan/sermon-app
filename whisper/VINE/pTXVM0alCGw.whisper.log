[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Can we thank Carla and just bless her as well?
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.440]   It is honestly so, so good to be back.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.960]   I am so grateful to be welcomed back.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.440]   I was here last Sunday.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.840]   I had absolutely nothing to do last Sunday, so I was here, anonymous, just sat here.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.160]   So many of you came up and welcomed me back, gave me hugs, and it was such a beautiful
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.160]   thing.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.960]   It's so nice to know that I can come home, that I can be here with you guys again.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.720]   But the thing that really, I think, fills my heart with joy is just to see how the church
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   has flourished and grown in the four months that I have been away.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.200]   The incredible job that our leadership team, our executive leadership team, our eldership,
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.220]   our pastors, volunteers, everybody who's involved in making not just Sundays, but all of church
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.680]   community happen.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.280]   I came back last week, and it felt like this church has grown.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.680]   And by that, I don't mean numerically, I mean, although it has actually grown numerically,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560]   I actually mean it's grown spiritually.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.560]   That's our desire.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.900]   Our vision is to grow big people.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.960]   So I came back last Sunday, and it was like, this feels like people have matured.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.660]   It feels like people have grown.
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.640]   So there's been this spiritual depth that's happened in the last four months.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.880]   And it is such a privilege to be able to step away from a community like this when you're
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080]   in a role of leadership here, and to be able to step back and know that the community is
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.800]   deeper and more mature, more on fire, is flourishing more now than it was when I left it four months
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800]   ago.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.320]   And again, that's credit to the amazing people that have walked with you over the last four
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.320]   months.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.600]   Can we give everybody a round of applause, all the pastors and leaders?
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.840]   Honestly, it's amazing.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   It's amazing.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.160]   I actually got a phone call about two weeks before I came back from a congregation member
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.280]   who will remain anonymous, bless them.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.760]   But they were like, "You don't need to come back."
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.080]   That was quite freeing.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.720]   I didn't need to come back.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   Wonderful.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.760]   But I chose to come back because this is home, and I'm so grateful to be able to walk with
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.560]   you guys and to lead alongside of the other leaders and pastors here over the coming months
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.560]   and years ahead.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.360]   My last message here at the Vine was actually on June 30th, and that was a day before I
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.200]   stepped on the sabbatical on July 1.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.800]   And in that message, I brought a message to you guys about the prayer of Jabez.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.680]   And I spoke about how the prayer of Jabez is often misunderstood.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.840]   We've often interpreted it as a prayer of blessing, a prayer of expansion.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   But actually what it is at its very core is a prayer of a man who is desperate for God
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.320]   to change and transform and liberate him from some of the labels that have been placed upon
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.320]   him.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.880]   We learned in that small passage about Jabez that his name literally means one who causes
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   pain.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.520]   His mother had had a painful childbirth, and so she calls him Jabez because it sounds like
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.840]   the Hebrew word for one who causes pain.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.320]   And his whole life, he's lived under the influence and the pressure of a label that he was desperate
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.040]   to be free from.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.180]   And he had always had this kind of thing upon him that I'm one who causes pain, I'm one
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180]   who causes pain.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.800]   And so actually his prayer right at the end of it, he prays to God and he says, "Would
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.360]   you no longer have me be someone who causes pain?"
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.000]   He cries out for the liberation of God to transform the broken label that he was carrying
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.880]   since literally his birth.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.040]   And I shared on that Sunday that that resonated with me as I stepped into sabbatical.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.240]   That I recognized that there were labels and things that I was carrying.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.940]   I recognized that there was identity issues that I had taken on board a little bit too
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.080]   deeply and that there had been things that had happened over the years where people had
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.200]   said something or an email had been sent or a conversation had happened and words had
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   hurt me.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.480]   And I was carrying around labels and words that I was struggling to be free from.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.760]   And I shared with you on that Sunday that I was looking forward to stepping into sabbatical
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.080]   and asking God to liberate me from some of the inner insecurities, inner self-doubts,
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.880]   the things that I was wrestling with deep inside about how I thought about myself, how
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.240]   I thought about being a pastor, how I thought about leading in my home, whatever it might
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   be.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.800]   I was carrying brokenness and I wanted God to set me free.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.600]   The other thing that was right alongside of that as I stepped into sabbatical was the
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.080]   reality that in February I turned 50 years old and I was struggling with the reality
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.320]   that now I'm very, very old.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.560]   You know, it's an interesting thing to turn 50 because it kind of feels like your whole
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.920]   life shifts and I realized that I'm a pastor who's leading a church where the average age
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.440]   of our whole church community is 29.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.000]   29 and 50 is a long way away from each other.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.280]   And although I feel 29 on the inside, I realize I don't look 29 anymore.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.320]   And I was beginning to wrestle with self-doubt like am I past my use-by date, you know?
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.360]   Like can I be relevant anymore to this generation?
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.760]   And so I was taking on board some of those thoughts as I was stepping into my sabbatical.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   I was also wrestling with what am I going to be doing for the next 15, 20 years of my
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.560]   life and what is God's heart for the vine and all the things that are happening here.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   And I wanted God to speak in about my future and speak about the future of the vine.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.800]   And so all of these things, the insecurities and self-doubt, the fact that I was pretty
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.560]   old and I was dealing with that, the fact that I was looking for some answers to some
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.580]   great questions about my future and your future and the future of this church.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.560]   So on the first day of sabbatical, I took out my journal, which is my iPhone, and I
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   wrote some questions in there that I was desperate over the four months for God to answer.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.560]   Let me read you the actual questions I wrote down.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.680]   How much longer do you want me to be a pastor?
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.200]   Because I recognize I serve as a pastor under the calling of God and he may not want me
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.520]   to be a pastor forever.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.640]   So how much longer, Lord, do you want me to be a pastor?
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.280]   Connected to that, I was asking the question, how much longer should I lead the vine for?
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.260]   I've been leading here now 15 years.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.400]   What a privilege it is to have done that.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.920]   But how much longer am I going to be leading in this context, which led me to another honest
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:29.040]   question when and should I hand over the church to the next generation?
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.320]   But along came the feelings of excitement in that, but also what does that mean for
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320]   my future?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.840]   And so I asked this question, what the heck will I do for my living if you take the church
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.320]   away from me?
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.280]   I literally wrote that in my iPhone journal.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.480]   And I was honest.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.360]   And notice what I'm saying in that question.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.720]   It's like, if you take this away from me, God, what am I going to do?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.600]   How am I going to afford to live?
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.400]   These are honest, raw reflections I'm having.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.280]   I was also asking this, why am I still so filled with insecurity and self-doubt?
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.880]   Why as a 50-year-old man am I still struggling with some of these realities in my life?
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.440]   And I think actually the most important question I had on my heart as I stepped into the sabbatical
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.600]   was this one, do aliens really exist?
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   I needed...
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   Just kidding.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   I didn't ask that question.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.120]   Okay, let's wipe that one out.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.240]   The other questions though were real, and that gives you a little snapshot of what was
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.880]   on my heart, what I was holding as I stepped into the sabbatical.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.520]   And literally I was like, God, you need to speak to me in these areas.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.640]   You need to give me revelation about me, my insecurities, about the future, about what
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.480]   I'm supposed to do, all of this stuff.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.400]   And I'm really excited to come back after four months and announce to you today, and
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.040]   this actually is a big thing.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.000]   I want to announce to you today that God didn't speak to me about any of those things whatsoever
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.280]   over four months.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.320]   None of the things that I wanted him to speak to me about, did I get any answers or revelation?
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.040]   It's like just wipe them all away, clear it away.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.200]   God was not interested.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.960]   It's almost like God was like, I kind of gave him my laundry list.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.320]   Have you ever done this?
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.800]   Only me.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.920]   You give God a laundry list of all the things on your heart and he's like, "Oh, Andrew,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   Andrew, Andrew."
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.040]   And he just sort of went, "Yeah, we're just going to put those things to a side.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.120]   Not that they're not important.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.480]   Not that I don't hear that your heart is asking those questions.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.240]   We're just going to put those things aside.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.160]   Let me tell you what I am going to talk to you about over the next four months."
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160]   And here's what God said.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.960]   This is about two weeks into my sabbatical.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.440]   He says, "Andrew, I'm only going to speak to you about three things.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.360]   Your relationship with me, your relationship with yourself, and your relationship with
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   your wife."
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:54.080]   He said, "Those are the three things that actually really matter over the next four
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:01.040]   months because you need a fresh relationship with me because it's gotten stale.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.480]   You need to see yourself differently because you have to get free from some of the ways
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.880]   that you see yourself.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.680]   And you need to fix your marriage."
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.040]   And I realized that I had gotten stale in my relationship with Christ.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.040]   That it was easy to do a job about a relationship with him more than it was to actually have
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.480]   a deeper relationship with him.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.440]   I realized that those insecurities were impacting me and I was beginning to think negatively
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.680]   about me as I stepped into my 50s.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:37.640]   And I also realized that I had been very selfish towards my marriage and my wife.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.540]   I had been selfish in terms of looking after myself and not necessarily taking my wife's
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.280]   needs as seriously as I should.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.060]   And I realized that I had done the classic pastoral cliche and I'd served ministry more
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.560]   than her.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:57.360]   And so God just wiped everything away and said, "These are the three things, us, you,
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.440]   Chris."
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:05.800]   And I felt like the freedom that came in God basically saying, "These are the only three
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.840]   things that matter.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.280]   What you do doesn't really matter.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.480]   How you do it, when you do it, what's going on for the vine, eh, the vine's awesome, Andrew,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.880]   you don't even need to come back.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.640]   What does matter is these three areas of your life.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.040]   Everything else is foundational from there."
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.280]   And so although I wanted to come back to you with some great revelation here this morning,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.040]   I actually come back to you with a great relationship.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.760]   As cheesy as this will sound, but I don't apologize for it, I just really, really love
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.320]   Jesus again.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.080]   Like I think the most wonderful thing is to stand before you this morning and say, "I
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.600]   really love Jesus again."
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.980]   Now it doesn't mean I didn't love him before, but I love him in a way that I feel like I've
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.360]   never loved him before.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:06.040]   I feel like there's a revelation for me, a new journey in my community with the Father,
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.800]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and I come back to you basically very chilled out.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.440]   I'm like Superman of peace.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.280]   You can say anything to me and I'll be like, "I love you."
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.280]   Because I love Jesus.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.240]   And I love Jesus because I spent a huge amount of time with him.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.360]   One of the things I did on my sabbatical over the four months was this thing called the
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.520]   Camino de Santiago.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.160]   If you've not heard of this before, it is a Catholic pilgrimage walk that is 800 kilometers
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.440]   long.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.400]   And you start in a place in France called Saint Jean-Pied-de-Port, and you walk all
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.680]   the way to a place on the west coast of Spain called Santiago de Compostela.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.920]   And in that, it takes about 34 days.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.600]   You walk around about on average 25 kilometers a day with a big backpack.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.400]   You carry everything with you.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:59.760]   I did almost just under a million steps over the time of going from France all the way
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.480]   to the west coast of Spain.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:08.000]   You're walking mostly in rural areas, and so you have a lot of time on your own to yourself.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.600]   Now I am an extrovert with a capital E, so I was worried about what it was going to be
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.760]   like to be on my own for so long walking in a foreign land that I did not speak the language
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   or know people.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.180]   And you can walk for hours without seeing anyone, but I absolutely fell in love with
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.000]   Jesus again as I spent time with him.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.360]   This particular walk was actually first walked in 812, not 1812, 812 in the ninth century
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:43.960]   when apostles of Saint James, the actual James of the New Testament, when his followers decided
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.980]   to carry what was believed to be his bones from France to the west coast of Spain.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.080]   And the path that they took in 812, they walked it.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.800]   Pilgrims have been walking that same path ever since.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.120]   And it's always had been a dream for me to actually do that walk and experience it.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.400]   And you can kind of see in the photos here behind me some of the snapshots of it.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.960]   You're walking in this beautiful place.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.840]   You're visiting all these incredible churches.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.760]   There's different churches every day when you're walking that will host you, that will
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.000]   pray with you, beautiful Catholic nuns and priests that come around you.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.560]   It is one of the most wonderful things.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:29.080]   The cross that you see here that I'm standing next to, that cross was built in 1072.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.440]   And pilgrims have been walking and laying down a stone at that cross since 1072.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.320]   So I took a stone from Hong Kong, one of the beaches here, and carried it and laid it down
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   there.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.720]   Just amazing experiences.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   But the most time I'm spending with Jesus, I'm spending upwards of about five to six
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:51.000]   hours a day as I'm walking in and out of prayer and connecting with the Holy Spirit.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.640]   And I don't know about you, but when it comes to actual people, it's kind of an interesting
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   thing.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.040]   Sometimes the more time I spend with people, the amount I like them less.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.880]   Has anyone ever been in that situation?
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880]   Or is it just me?
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.680]   Am I the only bad person in this room?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.880]   But you spend more time with people and then you actually discover they've got flaws that
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   you didn't think they had, right?
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.400]   Or they reflect your flaws back to you and you realize you've got flaws.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.160]   Or you had put them up on a pedestal and thought they were a certain type of person and you
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.100]   spend time with them and you realize that's really not who they are and you get disappointed.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.420]   Sometimes we spend more time with people and we like them less.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.320]   That does not happen with Jesus.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.720]   The more time you spend with Jesus, you will always fall in love with him more.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.040]   That's the beautiful thing.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.520]   You get to see his grace and his heart and his love and his mercy, and it becomes more
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.360]   real to you as you spend that time with him.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.360]   You don't like him less.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.000]   You love him more and I come back to you again without great revelation.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.920]   I come back to you with a great relationship.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.880]   I just love Jesus.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:02.720]   Now, I know probably what many of you are actually thinking in this moment.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.320]   "Oh, well, that's well and good for you, Andrew.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.420]   You had sabbatical.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.560]   You got four months off."
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.880]   I tell you what, Andrew.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:17.960]   If I took four months off and you put me in Spain and you put a backpack on my back and
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.840]   I had great food and great wine every day, I'd love Jesus more too.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   I know what you're thinking.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.960]   I know what you're thinking.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   And you know what?
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:35.920]   It's true.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.160]   But the reality is, for many of you, you're not going to be able to get four months off
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.160]   work.
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.440]   You're going to be stuck in your career your whole life and you've never had that much
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   time off.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   And I totally get it.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.880]   So here's actually the question that I come back with.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.280]   How do we deepen our love for Jesus in our normal life?
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.280]   Right?
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.320]   Like in the normal busyness and stress and all the responsibilities we have.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.120]   Surely that's where we need to be thinking.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.760]   How do I deepen my love for Jesus?
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   It's great, Andrew.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.760]   You had four months.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   You did that.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.760]   But that's not hitting me relevant this morning.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:13.000]   I need to understand how in my life, in my work, in my career, in my family, how do I
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   deepen?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.680]   How do I take a step of becoming more like Him?
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.240]   That's the great discipleship question we should always be wrestling with.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.120]   And what I want to do with you today, but also over a number of one-off messages in
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.680]   2025, I want to actually share some answers or share some tools for you by which I think
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:36.200]   you can do this so that I hope you do get a sabbatical at some point in your life and
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.140]   you can do some crazy thing with that and fall in love with Jesus.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.960]   But I don't want you to have to rely on that.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.160]   I don't want to have to rely on that.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.400]   I need to be able to do this on a day-by-day basis.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.520]   That makes sense?
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.260]   So what I want to do this morning is just share the first of those things with you.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.760]   It's perhaps the thing that I feel like God did most in me whilst I was walking on the
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.760]   Camino.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:02.680]   And it's something that I honestly believe if you can just make this one simple shift
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.460]   in how you think about God that I'm going to unpack for you today.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.400]   If you can just make a simple shift in that, I believe even this week you can refreshen
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.920]   your relationship with Jesus.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.400]   And to help you to understand that, let me tell you a story that happened to me whilst
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.520]   I was on the Camino.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.400]   So the Camino, most of the time, the 800 kilometers, you're walking in rural Spain, beautiful rural
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.860]   Spain, visiting small villages throughout the time.
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.200]   It's a wonderful place for solitude and rest.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.680]   But throughout the walk, you come up to major cities as you go, and you have to walk through,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.520]   stay and walk through those major cities, like Pomplona, which is where the Chasing
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.680]   of the Bulls is, a city called Legrono, Burgos, but in particular, a city called Leon.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.440]   Now Leon happens about 500 kilometers into the walk.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.960]   So I'd been walking by about three weeks by then, and I come to this city of Leon.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.800]   Leon is 200,000 people.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.080]   It's a big city.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.360]   And just before I got to Leon, the previous almost week and a half, I'd been walking in
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.420]   the most rural part of Spain that we were going to walk in throughout the whole trip.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.200]   And so I'd walked on my own.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.120]   I'd been in this place of great fellowship with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:16.820]   And then I come into Leon, and the contrast between this rural, solitary life I was living,
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.640]   and then this crazy big city of 200,000 people, hustle and bustle of Leon, was actually quite
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   a lot.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.640]   It was very overwhelming.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.040]   And I remember getting there, and there's some advantages of ending up in a city when
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.160]   you're doing a walk like that.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.520]   You can refresh your toothpaste and do some things like this.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.480]   I actually stayed in a slightly nicer accommodation, and I had a bath.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.720]   Praise the Lord Jesus.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.360]   But I also was struggling with this contrast and kind of going, "Okay, I need to get out
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.440]   of here as quickly as possible.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.280]   I want to get back into the place of solitude and the rural Spain."
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.040]   So I decided the next morning, I'm going to wake up a little bit earlier than I normally
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.600]   do, and I'm going to start walking a little bit earlier than normal, just because I wanted
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.400]   to get out and get into it.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   So I woke up around six or so, started walking around seven.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.680]   Normally we would start walking around eight.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.480]   And I started walking out of urban Leon.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.120]   Now I was walking down a normal, busy kind of Leon street, a lot of people commuting
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.880]   to work at that time.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.560]   And I'm walking there, and I suddenly hear this man shouting.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.280]   He's on an electric scooter.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.720]   You know those little scooter things, not like a big bike, but just the little thing,
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.720]   right?
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.520]   He's on this electric scooter, and he's shouting.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.720]   And it sounded to me like, "Leather!
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.800]   Leather!"
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.120]   Which I thought was Spanish for "get out of my way."
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:41.160]   So I kind of moved out of the way, but he scoots right up to me, and then I suddenly
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   could hear him properly.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160]   He's like, "Pastor!
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.160]   Pastor!
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   Pastor Andrew!"
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.000]   And I'm like, "I can never escape!"
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   No, it's good.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   No, it's good.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   He's like, "Pastor Andrew, is it really you?"
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.800]   And I'm like, "Yes, it's really me!
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.120]   Who are you?"
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.600]   It turns out this guy's name is Emmanuel.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.280]   And Emmanuel was from West Africa.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.840]   And Emmanuel was one of our asylum seekers here at the Vine back in 2018.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.440]   Now here's the crazy story.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.240]   He was a part of the Vine for four years.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.400]   Him and his family were here.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.920]   There were asylum seekers seeking for asylum.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.960]   They were finally, in 2018, given asylum.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:29.320]   And we as a church community helped him and his family move to Spain to kind of start
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.320]   their new life.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.560]   And they decided to settle in this city called Leon.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.400]   And then fast forward until 2024, he's on his little scooter heading to work in the
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.400]   morning.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.720]   And he's kind of scooting along this road that he scoots on every day.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.520]   And he looks and he's like, "Pastor Andrew?"
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.400]   And I'm just like walking, thinking I'm completely anonymous in the middle of some crazy place
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.760]   in Spain.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.720]   And he comes up to me and he's like, "I can't believe it's you."
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.040]   And I'm like, "I can't believe it's you."
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.560]   And we chat and we had a great time of praying together.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.960]   And he was on his way to work.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.520]   He was a bit late, so he had to keep going.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.280]   But I thought afterwards, how crazy is this?
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.600]   Like if I had left 30 seconds earlier or 30 seconds later from my hostel, if he hadn't
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.720]   been running late for work that day, we would have never have seen each other.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:22.040]   But God somehow took all of this crazy stuff and made this crazy kind of encounter, this
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:27.480]   random encounter, so that we would bump into each other, so that God would remind him that
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.360]   we're still praying for them and we're still working with refugees.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.740]   And he loved to hear about that.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.160]   And then to remind me that I'm not on my own, that God is with me.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.360]   I remember walking out of that experience just praising God and saying, "God, it's so
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.160]   awesome to know I'm not alone.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   It's so awesome to know that you are with me.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.680]   What a cool moment that could only have been orchestrated by you."
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.640]   And God, in the way that only he can, came back and said, "Andrew, Andrew, Andrew."
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:02.340]   He said, "It's funny to me that that encounter you just experienced with Emmanuel is exactly
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.760]   how you expect to experience me."
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.080]   In other words, God began to speak to me about the ways in which actually I kind of think
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:20.440]   that my encounters with God are like they happen because of some crazy thing that happens.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.320]   Everything comes together and then I encounter God.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.800]   Like my encounter with God is not an everyday normal thing.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:30.880]   It's actually requires a lot of work for it to happen for me to feel like God is with
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   me.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.840]   Because I was like, "Oh God, I know you're with me now because you've done that."
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.760]   And God's like, "You didn't realize I was with you before that crazy moment?
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.320]   Are you with me?"
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.720]   And maybe this resonates with some of you here this morning.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.160]   And I know as your pastor over the last 15 years, I know that many of you have these
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.920]   kinds of questions on your heart.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.320]   Why is it that other people seem to experience the presence of God more than I do?
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.520]   Why is it that despite the fact that I'm trying so hard and I'm reading my Bible and I'm praying,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.420]   I just don't feel him?
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.860]   Why is it that when I come to the vine on a Sunday and I look around the room and everybody
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.760]   else seems to be worshiping in the spirit of God, I feel so distant to him?
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.640]   I know that many of you struggle with that feeling.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.780]   And I want to be honest with you, I struggle with that too.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.840]   And so here I am and I feel like God is challenging me and he's saying, "Andrew, there is something
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:28.560]   going on in your thinking and in your theology that makes you think that it's a lot of hard
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.280]   work to encounter my presence."
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.680]   And again, I wonder whether that resonates with any of you here.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:44.480]   Let me ask you this, does it feel like for you that God is more a random encounter than
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.900]   a constant presence?
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.900]   I want you to think about that.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.440]   I want you to reflect on that for a moment.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.720]   If you're honest with yourself, does it feel like for you that God is more a random encounter
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:08.360]   like that meeting with Emmanuel and Leon than actually a constant presence at all times?
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.500]   I certainly felt that way and I certainly struggle with that.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:18.080]   But here's what I know, I know that God is not some random encounter, that God is here
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.880]   in his presence, in his fullness at all times.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.360]   The wonderful thing about what it is to be in a relationship with God is that he is all
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:31.280]   around us and yet so often as Christians, I think we kind of sort of live and act and
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.000]   speak and do in ways that would communicate anything but that.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.160]   That actually if you think about some of the language that we use, even in church, or the
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.280]   language sometimes that we use in our own private lives, it seems to communicate that
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.960]   we think God is somewhere else all the time.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.160]   That oh man, I just hope that I get an encounter with God at the vine today, which really is
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:00.040]   saying like I need some special moment for me to feel like God is present.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.640]   We use language, I use this language oftentimes even in my leadership here, we use language
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:11.080]   like this, "Lord today, as we gather together, we invite your spirit to be here."
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.480]   Have you ever heard that in church?
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.260]   Have you ever stopped to think about how bad a theology that is?
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.560]   Because when we are constantly in this thinking and using language like I want to invite you,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:31.680]   what we're really saying is you're not here unless I say some sort of prayer or do something.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.800]   So Lord, I invite your spirit to come to us or even in private moments, our prayer life
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.720]   so often is Lord, I invite you to meet me in this really difficult moment that I'm having
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.400]   here and I feel like of course the heart of that is right, but I feel like God is saying
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.040]   if your language and if your practice so often communicates that, you're actually kind of
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:57.600]   really betraying the reality that is true for everyone.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:03.440]   Think about this, the language of invitation communicates first of all that the person
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.880]   that you want there isn't currently there, which is why we have these great invites for
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.400]   you for the time that is ahead, right?
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.880]   For Christmas Sunday, because we want you to actually invite some people who are not
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.460]   currently attending the vine to come on Christmas Day, are you with me?
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.020]   So when we say to the Lord, we invite you, Holy Spirit, we're kind of communicating something
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.020]   similar.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.740]   You're not currently presently here, but I want you to be here.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.220]   So I invite you to be here.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.620]   Here's the second thing I think it communicates.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:38.460]   It kind of communicates that God's presence is our determination and not his.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.380]   Are you with me?
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.940]   It kind of communicates to God like your presence is down to whether I invite you or not, to
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.940]   whether I ask for it or not, that it's kind of in my hands, whether you're going to show
[00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.580]   up in this moment or not.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:57.620]   And we have this horrible thought that actually I'm kind of responsible for the presence of
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.620]   God.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.900]   And I tell you what, that is totally the other way around.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.480]   You are not responsible for the presence of God.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.860]   God is responsible for his own presence.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.140]   It's really funny because Elijah, when he's standing on the mountain with the prophets
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:17.380]   of Baal and he's trying to get the prophets of Baal to do what he's been doing with God
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:23.040]   and bringing fire down, he actually taunts the prophets of Baal with this exact thing
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.340]   that I think we so often do even in church community.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.740]   Let me read this to you in 1 Kings 18 verse 27.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.460]   It says, "At noon, Elijah began to taunt them.
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.460]   'Shout louder,' he said.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.020]   'Surely he is God.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.960]   Perhaps he's just in deep thought, or maybe he's busy or traveling.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.380]   Maybe he's sleeping and must be awakened.'"
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.380]   I love this.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.780]   This is Elijah getting super sarcastic on these people.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:52.300]   But I hear Elijah and I hear that being kind of said to me, kind of said to so often us
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   as Christians.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:58.380]   Like, if I only shout louder, if I only say exactly the right prayer, then I can expect
[00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:04.640]   God to show up and God standing to the side of that and saying, "I'm already here."
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.640]   Come on, church.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.380]   Here's the third thing I think this whole language or kind of idea of invitation communicates
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.380]   is this.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:17.620]   There are some places that are sacred and special and some places that are not.
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.460]   And that my job as a Christian is to show up tomorrow morning in the ungodly place of
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.820]   my work and bring the presence of God to my work.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.700]   Has anyone ever felt like that?
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.700]   And we bring this on ourselves.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.780]   It's like, "I got to go to the office tomorrow and somehow because it's evil, because it's
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:38.020]   broken, because it's filled with really nasty people, I need to somehow bring the presence
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.460]   of God with me into that place."
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.900]   And God's saying, "I was there long before you came.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.900]   I will be there long before you leave."
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:51.300]   And maybe one of the ways that we can refresh our relationship with Jesus in our normal
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:57.580]   lives is just simply shifting how we think about His presence.
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.080]   Maybe it's less about, "I need some encounter randomly.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.300]   And if God, you're awake and you're not traveling and you're present and you can do this, I
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.820]   would love to meet with you today."
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.300]   And maybe instead it's flipping it and saying, "God, you are always here.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.140]   Your presence is always with me.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.620]   And so I want to awaken to you."
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.460]   It's interesting.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.740]   If you study the idea of inviting God in the New Testament, in all the occurrences where
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:30.540]   inviting God is found in the New Testament, it's only ever in two actual contexts.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:35.560]   First context is the inviting of the Lord to come in at the moment of salvation, inviting
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.260]   the Holy Spirit to come and forgive our sin and forgive our brokenness.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.540]   And that's absolutely essential and important.
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:46.660]   And the New Testament celebrates the idea of inviting God to be with us as we first
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.760]   give our lives to Him and repent of our sin.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.140]   The second context, the only other context the idea of inviting God is found in, is this
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.140]   idea that we're going to be looking at in Advent, "Maranatha, come Lord Jesus."
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.440]   They didn't pray that in their church moments, "Come Lord Jesus to this moment right here."
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.980]   They were praying that, "Lord, would you come back at the end of all things?
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:12.380]   Would you come back and change the world and make everything just as you have desired it
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.380]   to be?
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.300]   We long for your second coming, Lord Jesus.
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.300]   Would you come?"
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.940]   The invitation was for Christ to come back and finish all of the work that He had been
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.120]   longing to do.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.700]   Those are the two contexts, salvation and the second coming of Christ.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.460]   And yet so often we still hold this weird theology that we need to invite God all the
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.540]   time when actually God is fully and beautifully present.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:38.940]   In fact, the New Testament teaches us the opposite of this.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.100]   It tells you that once you have invited the Holy Spirit into your life at that moment
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:48.940]   of salvation, the fullness of the Spirit of God, the fullness of the person of Christ
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.780]   comes and dwells in you.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:56.940]   It doesn't say a half measure that needs to every once in a while be invited to be
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.940]   topped up.
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.380]   It doesn't say, "Hey, you're going to get a portion, but if you're a good person, you
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.180]   might get a little bit more."
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.280]   The fullness of Christ comes and dwells inside us.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.820]   Some of you need to hear this right now.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.020]   Actually, as I'm preaching this, I'm feeling this for some of you.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.300]   Some of you, this is actually going to change, revolutionize how you see Christ.
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.540]   The fullness dwells in you right now if you're a believer in Jesus.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.620]   The New Testament celebrates that reality with Scripture after Scripture.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:29.740]   You're the temple of the Holy Spirit, but the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:34.460]   dead now lives in you.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:39.380]   So it's not a case of invites because I'm not sure.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:45.700]   It's a case of it is all here and I get to now live in the wonder of the reality of the
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.620]   fullness of Christ in me.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.300]   Here's the second thing the New Testament says when it comes to the presence of God.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.860]   Not only is the fullness dwelling inside of us, but from the Old Testament to the New
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.660]   Testament, there's a celebration of the fullness of God's presence in the world at all times
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.260]   everywhere.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.620]   This theological idea of the omnipresence of God, He is everywhere at all times, all
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.440]   around us.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.460]   So I want you to see this church because this was so helpful for me as I was rebirthing
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:20.060]   a love of Jesus, I came to understand and realize that my hope for encountering Christ
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.180]   is not some random event that's going to happen and every once in a while it will make me
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.420]   feel like I'm with Jesus.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.740]   No, here's the reality, whether I feel it or not, no matter where I am, no matter what
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:35.860]   I'm doing, the fullness of Christ is in me and the fullness of Christ is around me.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.660]   That will revolutionize the way you think about Jesus.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:44.300]   The fullness of Him inside of me, the fullness of Him around me all the time.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.420]   And the invitation of scripture is not to kind of think that you've got to manufacture
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.420]   some encounter with God.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:57.420]   The invitation of scripture is to actually realize that He is present in His fullness
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:05.860]   and you as a believer get the great joy of encountering Him always, every day, every
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:11.980]   moment in all things, walking in the presence of God.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.800]   So I want you to hear this because this is really important.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.860]   When it comes to the presence of God in your life, the issue is not inviting something
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.260]   that isn't there.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:26.540]   The issue is becoming more aware of what already is.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.980]   Come on church, are you with me?
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.260]   The issue is not inviting something that isn't there as if our thinking is that God is distant,
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.260]   we need Him to be close.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.580]   No, the idea is actually becoming more and more aware of what is already within me and
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:42.500]   what is already around me, the omnipresence of God in this world.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:49.140]   I want to come into a deeper revelation of the reality of His presence in my life and
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:54.100]   as I do that I can then live in the glory of that presence all the time.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:59.100]   And when moments like happened in the Camino when I met with Emmanuel, that's a celebration
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.180]   of a reality that is every day for me.
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.300]   That of course that would happen because God is at work in this world.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.820]   Not, "Oh my God, God you're with me because that amazing thing happened."
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.820]   Instead, that amazing thing should happen all the time because God is in control and
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.140]   I'm a believer, He is with me and in me.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.220]   Of course I bump into Emmanuel in Leon.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.180]   Are you with me?
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.500]   So we need to shift some things in the way that we think about the presence of God.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.520]   Here's a couple of shifts that I think needs to happen.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.460]   We need to stop thinking that as Christians we are the ones who deliver the presence of
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:38.220]   God and we need to begin to think that we're the ones that discover His presence.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.540]   We're the ones who get the great opportunity to see what He's doing in our workplaces.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.540]   When you wake up tomorrow and go back into your workplace, shift the way you think as
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.100]   you step in the door tomorrow.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.180]   Don't go, "Oh, it's so good that I'm a Christian here because if I wasn't here this place would
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.180]   be dead."
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:35:00.540]   Instead, why don't you think of it like this, I'm today having the great opportunity to
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:05.420]   connect with what the Spirit of God is doing in my business, with what the Spirit of God
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.860]   is doing in this place, in this work environment.
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.580]   I get to join Him in the work that He's already doing.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.060]   What a joy of an invitation that is.
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:21.140]   See, it's not us who invites God, it's God who's invited us.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:25.660]   Our job is not an invitation, our job is a subjugation.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:31.260]   What I mean by that is it's not come Holy Spirit because I don't have you, it's you
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:37.260]   are here in me and around the world, but so often I am distracted from you and my great
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.260]   joy in obedience is to say, "I am present.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.380]   I am here with your Spirit now."
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.900]   Let me offer you as I close three very practical things you can do this week to freshen your
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.540]   relationship with Jesus in this area of the presence of God for you.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.540]   Here's the first one, embrace thankfulness.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.420]   I tell you what, there is nothing in this world that will bring you into the presence
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.340]   of God more than just the idea of thankfulness.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:11.700]   Psalm 100 verse 4 says, "We enter His gates with thanksgiving on our hearts."
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:17.140]   Thanksgiving enables you to realize that the world is the way it is because God is in control.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.580]   When you thank Him, you are subverting pride in your life.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.500]   When you thank Him, you're subverting entitlement.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.340]   When you thank Him, you're not making yourself the center of everything and everything revolving
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.820]   around you, but instead actually He's the center of everything and you're revolving
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:32.820]   around Him.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.660]   When you get an active, conscious, thankful reality of the presence of God in your life,
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.020]   you will see Him like you've never seen Him before.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.700]   I tell you what, there's this beautiful moment in the Beatitudes where it says, "Those who
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.980]   have a pure heart, they will see God."
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:56.060]   One of the ways that you purify your heart is through the act of thanksgiving.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.420]   I'm thankful for everything right now.
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.420]   This is crazy.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.100]   If you ask my wife, she'll tell you this has gone nuts.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.020]   She's like getting tired of it already.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.020]   Fair enough.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.020]   But I'm thankful for everything.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.020]   I get cut off as I'm driving.
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.980]   I just thank the Lord for that moment, you know?
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.300]   I get served cold pizza.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.260]   I'm just thankful that I have pizza in my life, you know what I mean?
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.260]   Like everything.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:22.300]   And I'm consciously doing it because I want to ensure that I recognize that God is at
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   work in all things.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.780]   Is that helpful?
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   So embrace thanksgiving.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   Here's the thing.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   Watch your language.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:28.780]   Just be careful.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.780]   Keep an eye on your language.
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:34.700]   Because I think our language creates culture and culture kind of comes out in habit in
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.700]   what we do.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:40.860]   And sometimes our language is still this invite, which kind of communicates He's distant.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.860]   I wonder if we can flip that and kind of say, "Lord, I enter into you."
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.460]   It's actually the shift of going from a passive relationship with Him.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.100]   "Lord, you just come and do this stuff for me."
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.180]   To an active relationship with Him.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.500]   "Lord, I want to come and follow you."
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.220]   Pastor Ellison spoke about this beautifully last week.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.260]   Denying ourselves, picking up our cross, following Him.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.220]   That's an active work of meeting the presence of God in our lives.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.780]   But so often our language communicates passiveness.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.760]   Are you with me?
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.260]   It communicates this idea that everything needs to happen for us.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.780]   In fact, He's in us and around us and we get to serve Him.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   Here's the third thing.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.140]   Guard your awareness of the presence of God in your life.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.940]   Because we all get distracted.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.940]   We all have habits that distract us.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.540]   There's always things at work and at play that will hold us back from fully realizing
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.180]   the fullness of Him in us and the fullness of Him in the world at all times.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:39.880]   And so do a work in you to guard some of that distraction.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.120]   Here's an exercise you can do this week.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   You can do it tonight.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   You could do it tomorrow.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.580]   A simple exercise here.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.480]   Take your journal, i.e. your phone or your journal.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.640]   What helps me pay attention to God?
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.120]   Write a list down.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.800]   How do I pay attention to God?
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.640]   What helps me to connect in with the presence of God in my life?
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.360]   And then the second question, what hinders me from paying attention to Him?
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.080]   If you're part of one of our small group communities here, I want to encourage you.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.820]   Do that work individually.
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.640]   And then when you meet as your community group this week, bring your answers and share them
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.160]   together and pray for one another.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:20.220]   Because if we can open our eyes to the presence of God and if we can work hard to minimize
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:25.320]   the distractions and things that hinder that, you will fall more in love with Jesus.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.240]   It's guaranteed.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.960]   Because you will spend more time with Him because you will see Him at work in ways you
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.400]   never thought possible.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.700]   Someone once described a Camino as an 800 kilometer cathedral.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.000]   And that's how I felt as I was walking it.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.480]   I felt I was so thankful for every step, even though there were a lot of steps.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.520]   And even though it was physically a really difficult thing, I was so grateful because
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.700]   every moment was a moment to walk into the presence of God.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:58.360]   Every moment was a celebration of Him in nature and the beauty of the world around me.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.480]   And it was so good.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.200]   And I had this beautiful mix of visiting churches and praying in churches and visiting the
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:09.800]   wilderness and praying there and finding God in both just as powerfully.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.520]   And as I came back to Hong Kong, one of my questions was, what's going to happen when
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.520]   I get back here?
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:17.520]   I walked through Causeway Bay on my first day back and I was like, this is a cathedral
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.760]   too.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.200]   It's a very different cathedral.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.780]   But God is at presence and at work here in Hong Kong as much as He is in rural Spain.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.320]   You don't need the Camino to freshen your relationship with Jesus.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.280]   You just need to open your eyes to the wonder of what is inside of you and the wonder that
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   is all around you.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.200]   C.S. Lewis, the great 20th century British theologian, he wrote it this way.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.600]   Let me say this.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.360]   We may ignore, but we can nowhere evade the presence of God.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   The world is crowded with Him.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.600]   He walks everywhere incognito.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.360]   And the incognito is not always hard to penetrate.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:56.600]   The real labor is to remember to attend.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.040]   In fact, to come awake.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.240]   Still more, to remain awake.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:06.640]   That's my prayer as I come back to you as your pastor, is Lord, would you help me to
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.160]   remain awake to your presence in me and your presence all around me at all times.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.920]   That's my prayer for you as I return.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:20.840]   That you would fall more in love with Jesus because you realize that He is fully here,
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.840]   fully now.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.840]   Amen?
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   Can you stand?
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:31.520]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:36.560]   As we just close our eyes, I want you just to take a moment.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.600]   I'm going to lead you in a time of reflection.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.200]   And if this has been a helpful word for you, if this is something that you think can help
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.360]   to shift your relationship with Jesus and the ways in which you've been thinking, maybe
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.440]   you could just, as our eyes are closed, just open your hands before the Lord.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:42:00.720]   Here at the Vine, we just do this as a symbol of just being receptive, of inviting the ministry
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   of God.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:07.680]   Notice I didn't say the presence of God, the ministry, inviting our, opening our hearts
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.440]   to what He might want to do and say in us in this moment.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.080]   So Lord, we open our hands before you.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:21.480]   And I want you just to take a moment, just to settle your heart.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:28.240]   Take a moment just to find a place of peace.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:35.080]   And in that place, I want you just to consciously now think about how the fullness of Christ
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.760]   is in you in this moment.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:45.160]   If you're a believer in Jesus here, the fullness of Christ is in you.
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:52.880]   I want you to consciously feel and think that the fullness of His presence is around you.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.840]   This is not something because you are in church.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.000]   This is exactly the same when you get back to your apartment, when you get into work
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.400]   tomorrow, conversations you're going to have over lunch.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.040]   His fullness in you and around you.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.280]   And as you just take a moment to consciously be aware of that, I wonder whether you could
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.680]   just start to be thankful.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:26.200]   Maybe just begin to be thankful for that mere reality.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.280]   Thank Him for the fact that the same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead is still
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.560]   also in you.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.880]   Thank Him that the fullness of Him is dwelt in you.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.920]   Thank Him that you are a temple of the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:44.240]   Then thank Him that He is at work in everything around you.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:52.560]   Then ask Him to begin to open your eyes to see, to discover the beauty of His presence
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   at all times.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   And I want to just pray as you do that.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   I'm going to stretch out my hands.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.800]   Father, I pray for every person here, everybody watching online, everybody in the overflow.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:14.040]   Lord, that you would release now, Father God, a freshness, a joy in every single person
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.560]   in their relationship with you.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:22.200]   Lord, we recognize that there have been staleness, that there has been ritual and routine, that
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.640]   there has been us going through the motions at times.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.440]   I sense for some of you, you're feeling very dry in your relationship with God.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.280]   And I pray that what we've been talking about today is the starting point of a new season
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:41.360]   for you, a rethinking and a re-engagement with the beautiful reality of His presence
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.760]   in its fullness in your life.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:49.800]   Father, would you move and have your way and your being.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:53.680]   And Father, would you release joy over us.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.440]   Lord, would we walk in the power of the reality of your presence.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:08.200]   May we be constantly in awe of the fact that you chose to come to us.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.560]   You invite us.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.560]   So as the team begin to worship, just take some time to deeply worship yourself.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.360]   Worship Him within you.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.080]   Notice Him, thank Him, glorify Him.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.920]   When you wake up tomorrow morning, remember this word and walk into your office tomorrow
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.800]   with the expectation that you will see what He is doing.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
