[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.900]   You guys go ahead and have a seat.
[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.060]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.400]   Well, good morning.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.320]   I feel like it needs to be said.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.080]   I am Pastor Promise.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.640]   It's a very odd thing to say Pastor Promise
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.920]   in reference to myself.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.360]   I normally go by just,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.680]   have you guys ever thought about this?
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.600]   Like pastors are like, maybe doctors sometimes as well,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600]   but like you don't like go around and say,
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.760]   hi teacher, this person or hi counselor,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.960]   this like Pastor Promise or I don't know.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.800]   It's a weird thing.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.760]   Anyways, I'm Pastor Promise, not preacher promise
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.440]   as Pastor Carla might get you to believe.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.980]   And I'm super glad that I can be here
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.320]   with you guys this morning.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.960]   And carry us another step forward in our Exodus journey.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.000]   Just quick show of hands, if you were here last Sunday.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.080]   Yeah, great.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.280]   What did Pastor Andrew talk about?
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.640]   What was the theme?
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.960]   We were here, but were we here?
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.840]   All right, good, now we know.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.480]   Last week was the Red Sea.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.480]   Last week was incredible.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.740]   It was one of the coolest miracles.
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.560]   One of the best sermons that I've ever heard on the Red Sea.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.760]   The Red Sea is a fascinating concept, right?
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.340]   Like I could never wrap my head around the reality
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.440]   that God parted the sea.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.440]   Like let's just not overlook that for a minute.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.240]   The fact that a sea went, it's crazy.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.540]   But Pastor Andrew took us to that very place
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.780]   in the Exodus journey.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.960]   And he showed us how we have to have the ability
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.120]   and the desire and maybe the step of faith
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.040]   to choose to follow God, even before he parts the seas,
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.080]   but he still parted the seas.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.340]   Now I think really interestingly,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.840]   I have a weird way of processing things.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.480]   So as that sermon was going through,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.960]   I was thinking about this movie, this show.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.280]   I think it's a movie.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.680]   Has anyone here seen "The Prince of Egypt"?
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.400]   Hey, all right, cool, we all know the song.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.560]   ♪ There can be miracles ♪
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.840]   - Ah, just hits the soul, right?
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.840]   Rest in peace, Whitney Houston.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.680]   Anyways, so in that movie, if you've not seen it before,
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.640]   it's DreamWorks' rendition of the Exodus story.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.560]   And it takes you through all the plagues
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.200]   and Moses growing up in Egypt,
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.520]   and they take them to the Red Sea.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.460]   And even though it's animated,
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.920]   it's still like massive and awesome and cool.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.600]   And it gets me thinking around the idea
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.240]   of what would it have been like for the people of Israel
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.400]   when the sea literally split?
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.880]   Like, let's just zoom in on that for a second.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.080]   What would that have been like to watch the sea go crazy?
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.640]   And then to like walk across it.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.320]   That's like a crazy miracle, right?
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.400]   Like I often wonder, like,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.160]   were they walking on the dry land?
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.000]   And then like, you know,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.080]   there's like a giant whale that comes by,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.940]   but because there's a wall of water, right?
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.720]   Like, you know, you see the, like in the movie,
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.120]   you see the reflection of the whale,
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.480]   but it doesn't actually reach you.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.560]   Or if you were a fish and it was Red Sea crossing day,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.920]   and you wake up that morning
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.400]   and you're going to your buddy Bob's house
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.000]   or Nemo's house, more appropriate,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.360]   and you're trying to swim over.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.600]   And all of a sudden you get to this part
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.080]   and you're like, "Whoa, humans.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.040]   "What am I seeing?
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.880]   "A bunch of dudes walking and ladies walking
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.800]   "and carrying things."
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.920]   I'm curious if they would have been like,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.080]   what is happening?
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.000]   Regardless, I think just, I know it's silly,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.740]   but like the Red Sea splitting is a crazy concept.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.360]   It's like a miracle.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.040]   It's like the miracle of miracles.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.740]   If you were to list out like the best miracles,
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.300]   like a top three, the Red Sea's up there.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.580]   Like if I could go back and see any miracle
[00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.940]   that would have happened in the past,
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.300]   I feel like that's the one,
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.300]   I would have been like, "Sign me up,
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.840]   "get me a ticket, front row seats.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.220]   "I wanna see what really happened."
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.140]   It's a really cool thing,
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.820]   but I think what we have to take away from the Red Sea
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.740]   and these miracle concepts is that it shows us
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.680]   something that's really, really clear.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.600]   God has no limit in his capability
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.560]   to provide for his people.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.420]   Like if he's gonna part a sea, what will he not do?
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.300]   Like he's just so willing, so capable.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.500]   He has so much of an ability to provide for his people
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.140]   that he parted the sea for them.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.620]   It's really the miracle of miracles.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.940]   And I bring that up because the entire story of Exodus
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.100]   has been quite filled with miracles,
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.840]   whether it's the sea turning, the Nile turning to blood,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.300]   or the sun going dark for a day,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.380]   or the livestock, or the frogs, or the flies,
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.420]   or the gnats, or the boils, or the, you just name it.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.460]   It's just miracle after miracle,
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.760]   after miracle, after miracle.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.260]   It's a bunch of miracles happening.
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.780]   And it makes me wonder,
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.560]   what exactly are all these miracles about?
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.960]   What do miracles actually do?
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.420]   And so I wrote a pretty little definition here.
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.820]   It says this, miracles are the inbreaking of the divine,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.260]   working and providing what we could not
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.220]   naturally achieve ourselves.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.300]   So just sit on that for a minute.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.580]   Miracles are the inbreaking of the divine.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.780]   So something that is done by God,
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.780]   and it's only working, or a key word here,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.220]   providing what we could not naturally
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.340]   achieve or do on our own.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.280]   So many miracles are based around
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.260]   the idea of God's provision, right?
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.380]   Like the Red Sea, the people were,
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.420]   hey, been freed from Egypt, they're on their way,
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.820]   and then they had this giant obstacle,
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.780]   and they need someone to provide them a way over,
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.660]   or provide some direction,
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.580]   and God shows up and parts the Red Sea.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.420]   It's about his provision.
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.500]   He literally provided a way
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   when there was an impossible situation
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.700]   in front of his people.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.940]   He's never unable to provide.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.500]   I feel like that's what we get from that.
[00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.820]   No matter what happens, God will provide for his people.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.160]   It's who he is, it's what he does,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.560]   it's part of his name, it's just who God is.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.580]   But the thing is this,
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.320]   miracles are just one of the ways that he provides.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.660]   It might be the most recognizable.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.660]   Like when we think of a miracle,
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.580]   we think of the supernatural, we think of the big thing,
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.560]   it might be the most recognizable way,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.780]   but it's only one way that God
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.440]   actually provides for his people.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.560]   God provides all the time for his people.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.280]   And so if miracles are just one way,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.900]   that must mean that there are other ways
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.220]   in which God provides.
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.120]   And I think it's very important that we today
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.760]   wrap our heads around what are some of the other ways
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.320]   that God provides for his people
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   beyond just the obvious supernatural miracle.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.220]   Is there another way that God chooses
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.440]   to emphatically declare to the world
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.700]   that I am God, that I provide for my people,
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.400]   and to declare to us that I provide for you.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.480]   Are there other ways in which that happens?
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.160]   And if there are, we've got to be able to recognize it.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.000]   So that's the key.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.800]   If there are other ways in which God
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.680]   does provide for you and for me in our journey,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.800]   then we've got to be able to recognize it.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.800]   But if we don't realize that it's there,
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.320]   we might miss it, only worshiping the God
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.580]   of the supernatural.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.800]   So as we continue our Exodus story today,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.280]   that's what we're gonna focus on.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.840]   We're gonna be looking at the challenges
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.920]   that the people faced when they departed from the Red Sea
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.520]   and in that journey.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.920]   And it's important that we really pay attention
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.040]   and grab hold of these truths,
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.960]   because similar to how God shows us
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.260]   that there's multiple ways that he provided
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.420]   for the people of Israel, beyond just the miracle,
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.700]   God also has multiple ways in which he's gonna provide
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.420]   for you and me as we too go through our Exodus,
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.680]   as we walk away from slavery, are set free,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.400]   and walk into his promise, into his freedom.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.920]   He has multiple ways of providing,
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.960]   and we've got to be able to recognize that as well.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.440]   So when we look at Exodus chapter 15 through chapter 17,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.000]   we are given a series of stories.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.460]   We're only gonna focus on two of them.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.120]   Two stories, two moments, two locations
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.360]   in which God provides in a way that is different
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.000]   from the big miracle.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.240]   So for a way to frame these two accounts,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.740]   and in order to best provide you a great introduction
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.480]   into what these stories are all about,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.280]   let's take a look at the film today.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:50.600]   - Israel have just witnessed
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.800]   one of the most incredible miracles recorded
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.560]   for us in scripture, with the parting of the Red Sea,
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.280]   and the subsequent removal of the threat against them
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.180]   by Egypt's army.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.280]   But as is so often the case in our journey to freedom,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.220]   dramatic moments of God's power are often followed
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.800]   by the seemingly difficult normality of daily life.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.400]   Israel have a long journey ahead,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.140]   and their days are now consumed
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.180]   with the tough and tedious work
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.240]   of walking through the desert of Shur,
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.160]   one of the most hostile lands on earth.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.900]   They find themselves stretched daily
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.120]   to their physical and emotional limits,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.200]   and their water and their food supplies quickly run out.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.800]   This is not the sort of place you would wanna be
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.620]   without food and water.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.600]   Across this series, I've spent hours
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.400]   walking through deserts like this
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.760]   to get a sense of what it would have been like for Israel
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.160]   in those first few weeks
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.240]   as they journeyed towards the promised land.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.300]   And I can tell you, it is unbearably hot.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.960]   It is sort of stark and barren.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.560]   There's a wind blowing right now
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.880]   that's putting sand in my eyes all the time.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.760]   You might be able to hear
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.920]   some of the wild dogs in this area.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.480]   I mean, this is not the place
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.560]   you wanna spend a lot of time in.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.600]   I mean, for me, I can escape easy.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.580]   I can go over there to the van that's air conditioned
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.860]   and get out of the heat.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.300]   But the Israelites, this was their life,
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.460]   week in and week out.
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.560]   They were carrying all of their possessions
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.620]   on their shoulders.
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.140]   They were walking daily, young and old alike.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.740]   I mean, every day would have felt like a moment
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.180]   of a fight for survival.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.420]   You know, the parting of the Red Sea
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.820]   in this kind of environment
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.820]   would have felt a long time ago indeed.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.040]   (dramatic music)
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.880]   (water splashing)
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.880]   the Red Sea. (dramatic music)
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.720]   (water splashing)
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.980]   (dramatic music)
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:10:07.780]   But God is about to change Israel's thinking
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.240]   when it comes to their understanding
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.400]   of His care and provision for them.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.420]   And it all starts with something as simple as this,
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.560]   a well dug here at Elam,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.460]   right in the heart of the desert itself.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.460]   You see, Exodus chapter 15 gives us the story
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.980]   of Israel being desperately in need of water.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.540]   And they suddenly come across this oasis,
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.660]   some 12 wells and 70 palm trees.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.940]   And to be honest, being here,
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.060]   I can really sense how overjoyed Israel would have been
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.540]   to finally find the relief of this natural water source.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.760]   I mean, it's a natural spring at the right time
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   and in the right place.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.320]   All of which teaches us something quite critical
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.840]   about God's provision in all of our journeys
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.440]   from slavery to freedom.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.480]   You see, the greatest miracles of God
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.680]   are often found in the most natural of circumstances.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.640]   Yes, He is the God who parts the Red Seas,
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.720]   but He's also the God who comes
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.800]   and holds all of the world's natural processes in His hands.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.180]   I mean, the rain that falls and collects in pools like this,
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.460]   the air that we breathe every day,
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.900]   all of them are provisions of God's blessings.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.540]   You see, the provision of God
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.460]   is quite literally everywhere.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.540]   And the question that God was asking Israel
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.060]   in this moment was this, do you actually see it?
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.120]   Sometimes the provisions of God are far closer to us
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.200]   than we ever would have expected.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.440]   Soon after, Israel has been provided the water
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.160]   at the wells of Elam.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.140]   They then come here and are attacked by the Amalekites
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.660]   right in the Valley of Rephidim.
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.920]   Now, Moses scrambles up to the side of the hill here
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.800]   and he looks down on the valley.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.080]   And the Bible tells us that
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.520]   if he holds the staff of God in the air,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.760]   well then the Israelites are having victory.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.420]   But if his arms drop, the Amalekites have the victory.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.780]   Well, for Moses, you can imagine the pressure
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.860]   this put him under.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.740]   I mean, I've just tried to do this myself.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.460]   If I hold my arms in the air,
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.420]   I can probably do it for about three minutes
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.940]   before they start to ache and they get a bit heavy.
[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.900]   Well, the same thing happens for Moses,
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.460]   his arms get tired.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.820]   And so he calls on two of his friends, Aaron and Hur,
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.260]   who come alongside of him, hold his arms up
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.540]   and keep his arms high until sunset.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.660]   And a victory comes for the Israelites.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.440]   Now, you've probably heard that story before,
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.980]   but I wonder whether you've ever stopped
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.560]   to understand how really strange it is.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.280]   I mean, think of it this way.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.360]   The Bible tells us that actually the Israelites
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.560]   were highly outnumbered by the Amalekites.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.320]   This was not a fair fight.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.440]   And God gives them a miracle in their victory.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.480]   And I've always wondered,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.220]   why didn't God extend that miracle
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.920]   just a little bit more to Moses' arms?
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.420]   Why didn't he give him a supernatural ability
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.160]   to hold his arms in the air?
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.680]   Well, God doesn't.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.120]   And instead, he has to call on his friends
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.860]   to help him achieve the very thing
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.960]   that God had called him to do.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.760]   Without Aaron and Hur by his side,
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.600]   perhaps the victory would never have occurred.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.360]   And I think all of this tells us something
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   really interesting about God's provision
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.240]   in any of our journeys in Exodus,
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.560]   that so often His greatest power is seen
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.600]   when actually He brings the community around us.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.140]   It's when we're working together as a team
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.540]   that we can achieve things far greater
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.120]   than we ever would have been able to on our own.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:43.640]   In these early moments of the Exodus,
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.280]   we see God's people learning to put their trust
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.660]   in God's provision,
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.160]   even at times when they don't appreciate it.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.720]   Whether that provision comes to them
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.140]   through supernatural, miraculous ways,
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.020]   or through the natural processes of the creative world,
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.380]   or even in the community that God's placed around them.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.100]   And I wanna say this to you about your own Exodus journey.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.780]   I want you to know that God is at work
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.260]   always providing for your freedom.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.660]   And my prayer is that He would open your eyes today
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.820]   so you can see it.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:22.300]   - And so the Elam story takes place
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.100]   off the back of one of the greatest miracles
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.220]   we've talked about.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.020]   Let me set the scene for us a little bit.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.500]   The people have experienced the sea parting
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.420]   and they're going to be walking through the desert.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.620]   You get the first, I think in Exodus 15,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.900]   you have the first ever worship song that's recorded.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.580]   'Cause they've just seen God at work
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.100]   in such a crazy way providing for them.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.660]   They sing a song praising God for rescuing them,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.540]   freeing them, destroying the Egyptians,
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.440]   and just liberating them into freedom.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.260]   And just not shortly after that,
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.860]   they're taken off of that mountaintop place.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.980]   And they're brought into a reality
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.860]   that I feel like most of us are regularly sitting in.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.980]   It's the reality of the everyday life.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.340]   So they're no longer at the place
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.140]   where it's like big miracle, whabam,
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.700]   God is for us, God is here.
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.620]   Now they're having to do the nothing fancy,
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.580]   the nothing big, the ordinary, the pretty simple stuff.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.420]   They've been liberated and they've already had the time
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.780]   of being able to focus on the hyper,
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.260]   hyper spiritual, supernatural stuff.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260]   They've seen it and now God's put them
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:31.260]   in the boring, everyday, ordinary, no fancy miracle time.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.260]   And their job is this, they are migrating out of Egypt.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.680]   So if you're migrating, they've got maybe some backpacks,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.780]   some donkeys, some horses, some carts,
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.380]   they've got all their stuff,
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.420]   and they're going to go into the desert.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.100]   So they're carrying things, walking,
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.120]   they're tired, they're hungry, they're annoyed,
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.680]   they're with people so they're definitely annoyed,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.740]   they're frustrated, they're sweaty.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.720]   It's daily life, it's what we normally go through
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.020]   pretty much every single day of our life, right?
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.860]   Just the normal stuff.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.160]   It's not a stage that's set for the supernatural
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.900]   breaking in for liberation, it's the stage that's set
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.480]   for meeting the basic necessities of humanity,
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.140]   of substance, of bread and of water, just the basic stuff.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.340]   The text tells us that they've traveled
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.020]   for about three days now, which doesn't seem
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.180]   like a very long time.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.060]   And in those three days, their water supply
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:21.900]   is starting to run low.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.280]   This is important because you're in a desert,
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.380]   it's hot and you need to drink.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.100]   So the people are starting to freak out a little bit
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.340]   and they get to this area and the place,
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.220]   they don't have a name for it, but they get there
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.120]   and they're thinking, okay, maybe we can rest here
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.820]   and get refreshed and replenished,
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.100]   but the water that they find is bitter.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.900]   So then they can't stay there, no one's gonna stay
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.360]   and build and replenish their animals
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.520]   and take care of themselves with bitter water.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.620]   So they actually name the place, the Hebrew word
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:49.540]   for bitter, which is more mora.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.020]   So they leave that area and they keep going
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.420]   and they're getting tired, they're wondering,
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.560]   you know, what's next, where do we find our place of rest?
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.380]   We just wanna chill out, we just wanna break.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.340]   We've been walking in the desert for a few days.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.060]   And I think it's right there in verse 27
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.700]   that God breaks through in a pretty unpredictable,
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.660]   unnoticeable way, something that I feel like
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.620]   for most of us, we would kind of just read over
[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.780]   and not really see, it says this in verse 27.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.380]   And they came to Elam, where there were 12 springs of water
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.180]   and 70 palm trees, and they encamped there
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.060]   beside the waters.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.300]   For the record, Elam sounds like a great place.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.100]   70 palm trees, it sounds like a good time.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.740]   So they see that and they're like, all right,
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.620]   here's a place.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.740]   I read that verse because there's nothing really special
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.060]   about what's just happened.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.320]   They were just walking, there was no staff,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.240]   there was no tornado of fire, they're just going,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.240]   they're just doing their everyday migrating stuff
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.580]   and they come across the right thing at the right time.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.080]   They find the right place.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.360]   No seas are being parted, but now they have a place
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.960]   where they can relax, where they can rest for a little bit
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.840]   before they continue their journey.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.960]   And it's a point where I feel like it's a bit awkward
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.480]   because it's not a clear picture of God's provision, right?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.360]   Like it doesn't say, and then God provided wells
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.100]   or God provided 70 palm trees to just grow overnight.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.720]   Like they just showed up and there's wells
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   and water to drink.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.560]   Is that a clear picture of God's provision?
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.600]   But I feel like it's pretty intentional.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.880]   Think about where this falls.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.980]   Right after they've had like maybe the clearest picture
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.640]   of God's provision, Spartan Red Sea,
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.720]   the whole Nemo thing that I talked about, right?
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.520]   You have that clear picture and now you have this
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.360]   where I just found some wells and some palm trees.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.920]   What do I do with that?
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.520]   I feel like it occurs intentionally in scripture
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:44.860]   right at that time on purpose for us to understand
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.140]   and see that God is working.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.840]   God is providing, he's leading and he's guiding
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.100]   even in the moments that are not so obvious.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.760]   That placing of that.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.280]   Now I wonder if we would consider our Exodus journey
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.400]   and where we're going with everything.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.720]   I feel like for us a lot of days are anticlimactic, right?
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.520]   Not too much is happening all the time.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.840]   It's pretty basic, pretty mundane, pretty ordinary,
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.260]   just living life, waking up, getting on the train,
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.200]   going to work, being annoyed at my friends,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.360]   drinking four coffees.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.120]   It's just part of the regular average day.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:23.800]   And it can be a bit challenging for us to see God in that.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.080]   Like where is God moving?
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.760]   There's no big miracle happening so is God even active?
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.440]   Is he still a part of this journey
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.880]   or am I just doing my everyday stuff by myself?
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.960]   I think that we have to realize that just because
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.040]   your Red Sea moment is behind you
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.080]   does not mean the best moments are in the past.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:47.000]   God, the miracle worker who parts Red Seas is the same God
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.120]   who just basically leads and guides us step by step
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.440]   to where we need to go.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.200]   He's the one that brings us to our elims,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.080]   our places of rest, the things that we need.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.880]   His provision on our Exodus journey is expressed this way
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.920]   intentionally so that we can hold on to hope
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.600]   that when we're not seeing him in the big things
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.080]   doesn't mean that he's not there.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.600]   This story gives us a bit of hope that
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.440]   just because the seed didn't part for me today
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.920]   doesn't mean God is inactive in my world,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.200]   doesn't mean that God doesn't care,
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.920]   doesn't mean that God is far away.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.960]   Please don't gauge God's provision or even his presence
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.280]   with you on whether or not big miracles
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.720]   are taking place around you.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.340]   He's still with you, he's still for you,
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.740]   he's still leading you into the very freedom
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:36.200]   that he has promised.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.000]   So can we choose to trust that he doesn't always
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.960]   have to do the supernatural to provide for us,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.080]   that the everyday and the ordinary
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.240]   are his provision methods too.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.800]   Perhaps the ordinary days are God's workstation
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.920]   and though it may feel empty and dry
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.160]   and like we're literally in a desert,
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.000]   can we trust that even when we don't see it he's working?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.240]   We're just saying that even when we don't feel it
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.320]   he's working, he's working on our behalf,
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   he's liberating, he's still the God that provides for us
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.760]   even in the small moments.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.920]   He's the God of the big and he's the God of the small.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.040]   Can we recognize him in those small moments?
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.360]   That's what Elam is calling us to see
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.720]   in this biblical narrative.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.340]   And so Elam provides that for us, right?
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.120]   It gives us an understanding that God is active,
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.460]   God is there in the small moments.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.120]   The Red Sea which happened right before that
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.400]   gave us an understanding that God breaks into our world
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.640]   and provides for us in miraculous ways.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.800]   We've got miraculous provision, we've got natural provision
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.280]   but there's actually a third way in which God chooses
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.820]   to provide for his people and it's based off
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.080]   of what happens in the second half of Exodus 17.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.040]   So what happens here is the people are,
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   they've left Elam, they've journeyed into the Desert of Sin,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.120]   they've had the experience of the manna and the Sabbath
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.240]   and all these great things and now they're moving on
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.360]   forward again, right?
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.500]   So they're continuing to go forward.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.000]   And just here in verse eight, it says it really clear.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.080]   Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.040]   This happens, it seems pretty dramatic
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.880]   but it does happen just as abruptly as it is written.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.220]   There is indeed a nation that, an established nation
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.720]   that starts a battle, an unprovoked aggression
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.320]   against the people of Israel who had not really
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.600]   been established as a nation yet.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.940]   You have to think about what would have their thoughts
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.920]   been in that moment.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.160]   God has provided for us in big supernatural ways,
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.840]   God has provided for us in the small
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.000]   but now there's a people trying to end our existence.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.680]   If we lose here, our journey of liberation might be over.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.600]   It's this whole Exodus thing for a waste
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.540]   if he'd bring us to the desert truly so that we would die.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.200]   I think those are the questions going through their heads.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.720]   Another question that I think they might have been asking
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.320]   themselves is, we've been slaves for hundreds of years.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.400]   How do we fight against an established people?
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.260]   Against an army that probably had weapons
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.840]   and had strategies and had different levels of hierarchy.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.720]   Actually Moses is funny, he just tells Joshua,
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.400]   go get some people and go fight Amalek.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.480]   I feel like Joshua's probably a little overwhelmed
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.320]   at that moment.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.760]   And also how do you recognize who,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.920]   like there's thousands, hundreds of thousands of them.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.540]   How do you know who's the best fighter?
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.840]   Is it the tallest person?
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.460]   Is it the dude with the cutoff tank?
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.940]   How do you know exactly who needs to be a part
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.360]   of this journey of this battle?
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.320]   And Joshua has to go and find these people.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.280]   Who's gonna be the great military mind
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.880]   to help them move forward?
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.340]   Who's going to be the one that gives them the best strategy
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.520]   to help them move forward?
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.600]   How do you fight a battle when you've never fought before
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   and your entire people's existence is on the table?
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.300]   It's the definition of a crisis.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.960]   And I love this, I find it interesting that God,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.520]   his methods are interesting.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   He meets his people and matches their challenge.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.100]   So what we've seen so far, at the Red Sea,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.120]   giant sea, giant obstacle, right?
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.040]   God shows up in a giant way, right?
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.240]   For the 19th time, parting of the Red Sea,
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.640]   fish, all the things.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.840]   The next victim that they face,
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.380]   they're in the desert and it's everyday life.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.260]   It's just a regular of sustaining and finding water
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.580]   and finding a place to rest and finding a place
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.820]   to make sure that my animals are taken care of.
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.300]   Just the basic everyday needs.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.660]   And how does God show up then?
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.320]   He leads them to Elam, leads them to the place
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.540]   of all the palm trees so they can just breathe and rest.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.440]   He provides for them based off of what their situation is.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.780]   He matches it.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.500]   And it wouldn't be any different
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.460]   in this coming situation, right?
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.900]   Because now the people of God are being attacked
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:56.740]   by a community, by a group of people under Amalek.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.660]   And God is going to provide a miracle.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.340]   However, this miracle is not gonna be a miracle
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.340]   that is able to be sustained in isolation.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.340]   This is a miracle that's gonna require the community.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.700]   They're being attacked by a community
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.300]   and God is going to work in a way
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.780]   that where their community is gonna be necessary
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.300]   to sustain and to actually experience
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.800]   the provision of the miracle.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   God would signify the importance of what a community is,
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   how it operates, and why it's so vital
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.080]   to every single one of our existence.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.040]   The only way that they will move forward
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.600]   and that they will experience this miracle
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.720]   is through a functioning community.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.800]   So let's read what the passage has to say here in verse 10.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.960]   It reads like this.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.800]   So Joshua did as Moses told him and he fought Amalek.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.880]   While Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.080]   then whenever Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.520]   Whenever he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.520]   But Moses' hands grew heavy, so they took a stone
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.760]   and they put it under him and he sat on it.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.040]   While Aaron and Hur, one on each side, supported his hands.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.560]   Thus his hands remained steady until the sun set.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.160]   And Joshua overwhelmed the people of Amalek with the sword.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   And they have their victory.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.520]   There are a few things I really need us to lean into
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.560]   and pull out of this passage for our understanding.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.400]   The first one is this, is sometimes God chooses
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.360]   to require the participation
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.320]   that's only found within our community.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.100]   Hear that again.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.480]   Sometimes God is going to choose to require
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.440]   the participation that can only be found
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.160]   within the community he's put you in.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.920]   This miracle is different from the other ones.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.400]   Moses, unlike other miracles, is not gonna be
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.360]   the only person that God is going to operate through.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.520]   God's gonna need all the people.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.560]   He's gonna need multiple people in that community.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.040]   God wants to use multiple instruments
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.480]   to provide for his people in this case.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.360]   The reality is that there will be parts
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.280]   of your liberation journey that God intends
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.360]   on us doing together in community with his people.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.240]   God uses Aaron, God uses Moses, God uses Hur,
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.360]   God uses Joshua to provide this miracle.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.960]   This miracle shows us that God provides for his people,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.200]   yes, but sometimes in such a way that their community
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.680]   is the only way for them to walk out
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.160]   that expression of provision.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.040]   The community becomes essential.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.240]   It becomes irreplaceable, a real part
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.640]   of the Exodus journey into freedom.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.720]   Every role is important.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.440]   It doesn't matter which role you hold.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.160]   They're all important in the community.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.280]   It may be easy.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.040]   I read this story, I naturally put myself,
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.680]   'cause I'm a little self-centered sometimes,
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.200]   I naturally put myself as the main character, Moses.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.200]   So I read this, I'm like, okay, cool,
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.280]   I need to be in community.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.680]   I'll be like the Moses and I'll have the,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.400]   I don't know, I'll be holding up the stick
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.840]   as God's told me to and I'll have Jethro and Emma
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.000]   and B'lanna and Ron and Carla and Andrew
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.760]   and they'll all be holding up my arms
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.060]   'cause I'm not that strong.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.640]   Maybe, maybe.
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   But there are other people in this story, right?
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.720]   What if God's actually not called you
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.320]   just to be the one who's lifting your hands
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.640]   but maybe he's called you to be in this moment
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.880]   the one who lifts the hands of the person
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.840]   that's next to you?
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:27.040]   What if the person next to you needs,
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.900]   hear the word, needs your support?
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.240]   Like I love the language of this text.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.280]   It doesn't just give us vague terminology.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.680]   It says that they are supporting his arms.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.920]   Like it couldn't be a more clear text on community, right?
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.760]   What if your Exodus journey requires the support
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.480]   of the people next to you?
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.160]   Let's just, I would say take a minute and look
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.440]   but let's actually take a minute and look to,
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.760]   we're gonna do it all together, ready?
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.780]   Look to your left.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.280]   Hey, good job, some people know their left
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.520]   and some people don't know that.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.680]   It's all right, a little confurring.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.880]   All right, now take a minute and look to your right.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.480]   These, unless you're on the end,
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.760]   then it doesn't work but it's okay.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.760]   [audience laughing]
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.720]   These are the people God has put around you on purpose.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.920]   Right, if we believe that God is almighty, all powerful,
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.240]   that he sits above the world and that he orchestrates things
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.440]   to be a certain way, then he has designed
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.500]   your Exodus journey to include the people around you.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.760]   You can't just come and attend, right?
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.920]   We can't just come and see it.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.360]   We're called to come and be a part of it.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.360]   You're called to play a role in your neighbor's journey
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.720]   to liberation.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.680]   But do we recognize that?
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.880]   Do we know that that's actually how God plans on providing
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.640]   in certain parts of their journey for them.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.280]   You get to be a part of that.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.080]   The people to your left, the people to your right.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.840]   We are surrounded by people who will lift your arms.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.640]   I can name so many people here who have metaphorically
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.740]   held my arms up in some of my toughest moments
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.840]   as I waited for God to bring my provision.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.700]   And that has sustained me, that has been miraculous for me.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.000]   But I feel like some of us don't have the same story.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.940]   Some of us haven't stepped into that aspect
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.960]   of community yet.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.840]   I believe God is calling us to consider how we
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.080]   could actually do that.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.240]   God sets up miracles and he does set up certain miracles
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:24.320]   in our lives to necessitate the need for community.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.920]   So whether it's in a community group,
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.400]   whether it's on the worship team or the production team,
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.040]   whether you're a host, whether you're downstairs
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.160]   on the first floor, whether you're with K4C,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.080]   whether you're on any, whether you're a mom
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.420]   and there's a moms group that talks about mom things.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.960]   These are communities that we have here at The Vine.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.360]   Whether it's Chinese community, Mandarin community,
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.200]   whether it's 180, there are so many places for you guys
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.280]   to step into and find people who will lift your arms
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.720]   as God takes you forward in your journey.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.040]   There are endless ways for you to be connected.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.340]   And not just be connected for the sake of being connected,
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.720]   but being connected so that you can have the provision
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.120]   that God has orchestrated for you.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.060]   God often works this way.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:16.920]   The question is would we be willing to,
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.480]   would we recognize and actually take a step
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.620]   in being a part of a community so that we can experience
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.800]   what it is that God has.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.160]   And if God often works in community through his people,
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.720]   then you will find that your own liberation,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.800]   that much of the freedom that God has designed for you
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.080]   will come through the community that he's placed you in.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.200]   I'll say that again.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.720]   If this is how God works through community,
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.580]   then you will find that your own liberation journey,
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.640]   the freedom that he is leading you into,
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:53.600]   that journey will be designed for you to have a community
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.040]   where his provision comes through.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.400]   It will be that community where you experience
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   the fullness of God's actual provision for you.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.960]   So let me just simplify all of these two stories
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.840]   into a couple of takeaways for us.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.920]   And a couple of things that we need to hold onto
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.960]   to really get this.
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.480]   These two stories are just basic snapshots
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.440]   of how God provides.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.880]   Again, the whole thesis of this is that God provides
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.540]   in multiple ways.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.960]   So as we journey into the freedom that God has for us,
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   the thing that we have to sit on,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.880]   the thing that we have to build around is that God provides.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.320]   God provides for his people, right?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.760]   That is what he does, that is who he is.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   But he provides in multiple ways.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.400]   And if we don't recognize the multiple ways
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.840]   that God provides in, we find ourselves being on the out.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.760]   We find ourselves missing what he's actually doing for us.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.860]   If we don't recognize the ways that God provides,
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.740]   we are at risk.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.800]   We are at risk of falling back into our slavery,
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.080]   feeling that God can't be found 'cause he's abandoned us,
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.500]   or that he's lost, or that he's forgotten about us.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.240]   The enemy would love nothing more, please hear this,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.680]   would love nothing more than for you to think
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.120]   that your ordinary days mean that God no longer cares,
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.720]   that God's no longer interested,
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.760]   God's done working with you.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.640]   And that's a powerful lie because you're going to have
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.760]   so many more ordinary days than miraculous days.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.880]   So we've got to understand, we've got to recognize
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.720]   that God is still God working in the small,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.740]   working in the little moments of our lives.
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.920]   That he's brought you out of Egypt
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.040]   and he's not left you alone.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.520]   Just because we don't see miracles
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.420]   doesn't mean that he's not providing.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:44.360]   It can discourage us, it can leave us doubting and confused.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.880]   But the truth is that God is truly
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.440]   in all of those moments as well.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.720]   He's providing in the big miracles and the small miracles.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   The story of Elam sits as a reminder to us
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.360]   to look around and see that maybe it's not
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.640]   something spectacular that's happening this week.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.300]   Maybe it's just a regular week where you have like,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.440]   you know that game, not that game,
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.160]   that like check-in where it's like,
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.800]   give me your highs and give me your lows, right?
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.640]   Like the peaks.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.680]   Maybe your week was just, no real highs, no real lows.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:19.720]   Can you look and see that God is working in that as well?
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.760]   Can you find God?
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.680]   'Cause again, we're just gonna have so many of those days.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.720]   And it would be a terrible thing for us
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.480]   to not be able to see God and see his activity
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.500]   in the basic things of every day.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.360]   The second thing is this.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:41.140]   We are at risk of pivoting our dependency from God
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.280]   to ourselves when we don't recognize
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:45.180]   God's provision in the ordinary.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.980]   This one is, this was the point in the entire preach
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.640]   when I was studying and reading that I just felt like,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.400]   like God hit me with.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.040]   Like we, the Elam moments feel so random.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.140]   They just seem so, they're so natural, right?
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.080]   Nothing big and spectacular happened.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.800]   And if we're only used to seeing God
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.040]   in the big and spectacular,
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.400]   perhaps we're tempted to see that Elam
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.000]   is a by-product of me, right?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.860]   The temptation easily can be, well, I worked hard.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.460]   Israel had a very good sense of geographical location.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.920]   That's why they found Elam.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   Or I studied hard, that's why I got this.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.800]   Or I left on time, that's why I got this.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.000]   Or I went out of my way and I was extroverted,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.400]   that's why I have these many friends.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.760]   If we don't recognize God's provision in the little,
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.340]   we become little gods ourselves.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.080]   We think that we become dependent on us to get us through.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.800]   And here's why it's problematic.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.000]   Because if you're gonna have so many days of ordinary,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.440]   what ends up happening is that we build our faith on us,
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.000]   on us, on us, on us, on us, on us, on us,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.960]   and we reach a moment where we need God
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.360]   and we don't even know how to find him.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.520]   And we don't even know that he's actually the one.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.400]   And we depend on ourselves and we end up more broken
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.760]   and more disappointed.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.080]   Could we choose to see that in those moments,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.440]   God is the one providing in the small.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.800]   God is the one that is the sustainer of every breath.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.600]   Scripture says that every good and perfect gift
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.960]   comes from who?
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.800]   Not from me.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.920]   We're not the ones that do it.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.760]   We've got to be able to remind ourselves
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.120]   and root ourselves in the daily things,
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:21.560]   the daily bread, the endless grace,
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.200]   the mercies that are new every morning.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.960]   All of these are blessings from God.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.400]   They're his provision.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.640]   They may not be big.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.640]   They may not be glamorous.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.120]   Seas might not be parting, but it's still God.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.800]   Can we see it?
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.200]   Can we guard ourselves from the temptation
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.780]   to become overly confident in us?
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.160]   I think one of the best ways we can do this,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.520]   'cause I don't wanna just leave you with theory,
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.960]   I wanna give you something practical.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.360]   One of the best ways, it's super simple, super ordinary,
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.080]   which fits the theme of today.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:58.920]   Thank you.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.760]   Thank you.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.680]   Saying thank you, being thankful,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.840]   small thing, super small thing,
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.040]   but saying thank you a couple times a day.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.320]   What will that do for us?
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.480]   How will that change the way that we see
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.840]   what's happening around us?
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.000]   How will that shift our perspective
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.860]   or awaken our recognition of the things that God is doing?
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.640]   I think if you actually challenge yourself
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.800]   to say thank you for the things
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.100]   that you're thankful for in your life,
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.560]   you'll recognize that daily,
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.040]   there are so many things to say thank you for.
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.400]   You'll recognize that daily, God is providing.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.600]   You'll recognize that daily,
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.740]   God is proving himself to still be with you and for you.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.720]   Simple as saying thank you.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.100]   It's a cute little thing, but man, it goes a long way.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.040]   Could you challenge yourself this week?
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.720]   Maybe in the moments where you're tempted
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.840]   to complain and be frustrated,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.320]   could you ask yourself, what am I thankful for today?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.520]   What has he given me?
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.840]   I know what I'm wanting, I know where I wanna go,
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.140]   but what has he done already?
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.100]   I'm still here.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.040]   Thank you.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.360]   Try that.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.160]   Genuinely try that this week.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   And see if it doesn't change the posture of our awareness,
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.500]   of the activity of God around us.
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.340]   Giving thanks is massive.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.160]   And it'll help us to see that he is the God
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.300]   in the small as well.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.700]   And here's the third point.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.240]   I believe the third danger is,
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.660]   we face in our Exodus journey
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.760]   is not recognizing the role of community.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.860]   I'm, for the record, let me, disclaimer,
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.460]   I work at the Vine, yes.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.700]   I work on the creative team.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.380]   I am not on the community group's team.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.620]   They did not pay me to say any of this stuff.
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.360]   But this text, if you read the text for what it says,
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.120]   you can't help but see how essential community is.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.720]   Community is one of God's methods,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.040]   is one of his strategies for providing for us.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.480]   God isn't always going to use small things,
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.200]   or big things, or ordinary things, or red seas.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.320]   Sometimes God's gonna use people.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.980]   That's good and bad, 'cause sometimes we don't like people.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.280]   But that ends up being the avenue
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.560]   in which God chooses to reveal himself.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.640]   That ends up being the avenue
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.240]   in which God chooses to provide for us.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:13.600]   And if we don't recognize that God's provision
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.360]   can often be found through his people,
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.500]   then we could find ourselves not prioritizing
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.120]   the very community that we're called to be a part of.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.600]   We can find ourselves on the outside
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.760]   of the very group that God has called us
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.440]   to be a part of to receive his provision.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.440]   The story of Moses, and Aaron, and her, and Joshua
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.040]   is so helpful, because it shows us that this,
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.040]   that, okay, so Andrew talks about it in the video, right?
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.780]   He goes, "I put my hands up for three minutes,
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.000]   "and that was too long."
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.120]   Now, some of you know this, some of you don't know this,
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.440]   but Pastor Andrew works out a lot.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.280]   He goes to a gym, no, he has a home,
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.560]   he built a gym in his house.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:56.060]   Like, he's pumping weights every Wednesday morning.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.040]   And he can only do three minutes.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.680]   We should check on his routine.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.240]   No, but, this is the 11 o'clock, he's gonna see this.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.400]   Hi, boss.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.680]   Anyways, please don't fire me.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.080]   Okay, cool, back to the point.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.120]   Here's what I'm saying, here's what I'm saying.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.200]   As great as Moses was, his hands weren't enough.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.040]   No, none of us can hold the things God has for us
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.980]   on our own, the weight of his provision is heavy.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:29.500]   And it requires those around you,
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.680]   the people that, when you look to your left and your right,
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.080]   the people that are here in this community
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.200]   to be a part of upholding your hand,
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.120]   supporting your arms so that you can see
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.800]   God's provision through.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.620]   Will you be bold enough to take a step into community?
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:47.800]   'Cause God doesn't just do it for,
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.160]   see, that blessing, that miracle,
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.440]   that provision wasn't just for Moses.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.760]   Remember, this is for all the people.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.520]   Right, so one person's ability to be in community
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.160]   and to allow the community to support them,
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.800]   that's a big one, that's something I'm,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   whoo, preaching to myself here.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.900]   Allowing your community to actually support you.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.580]   Moses could have said, "Nah, I've got it.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.960]   "I'll work out like Andrew."
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.080]   No, right?
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:19.120]   Allowing your community to actually be there for you
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.560]   is part of what God has designed community to be.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.520]   I know there's, I've had great experiences with community.
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.280]   I have some of my best friends actually came to the Vine
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   for the first time today, I won't embarrass you,
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.400]   but I was so excited they were here.
[00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.040]   I have great community.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.280]   But I know that's not the case for everyone here.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.720]   I know for some of us, there's some legitimate reasons
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.080]   why we're hesitant to be in community.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.800]   Maybe we're really busy, I get that.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.280]   Maybe we were in community before
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.560]   and we were stabbed in the back.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.820]   Maybe someone gossiped about us.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.980]   Maybe people have said things.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.100]   Maybe we weren't accepted.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.800]   Maybe we felt like we were on the outs.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.140]   Maybe we never truly fit in.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.460]   I understand that.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.800]   I get that.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.360]   These obstacles are real.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.600]   But can I say that I believe that this community
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.400]   here at the Vine can be a community
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.840]   that accepts you just how you are.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.360]   This community can be a community that loves you,
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.080]   that lifts your arms, that sees you into the provision
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.320]   that God has for you.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.120]   I believe that we can be that kind of community.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.080]   And if we can be that kind of community,
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.320]   why wouldn't you want that around you?
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.760]   If we can be that kind of community,
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.960]   what's stopping us now from stepping in
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.520]   to actually being with one another,
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.780]   not just attending a Sunday?
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:47.220]   My prayer for us here at the Vine is that we can truly
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.200]   position ourselves to care for our neighbors,
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.680]   to recognize those whose arms are tired
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.520]   and who cannot be sustained on their own,
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.960]   and be proactive to ask to come alongside
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.960]   and to support them.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.880]   My prayer for us, for all of us, is that we will do that.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.580]   And if we're doing that for one another,
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:14.320]   man, how much is God planning on providing for us?
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.360]   How many things is he gonna provide for that?
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.380]   I just can't wait to see through the people here.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.420]   Community is so essential.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.180]   I believe God will call us to consider
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.900]   truly being rooted in community,
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.800]   supporting one another,
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.360]   supporting one another from a place of love,
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.800]   a place of being close, of knowing each other,
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.280]   lifting the arms of those that are tired.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.860]   So I'm gonna close.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.920]   My friends, my teams, can we come on up?
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.300]   I genuinely believe this, guys.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.700]   I really believe we can be that kind of community,
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.560]   the kind of community that chooses to participate
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.320]   in what God is doing in the lives of those around us,
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.180]   the kind of community that lifts the arms
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.600]   and the hands of each other,
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.520]   the kind of community that's close and that's there,
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.220]   that works together.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.160]   I also believe we can be the kind of community
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.740]   that can recognize the activity of God,
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.040]   because it's so important
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:22.800]   to be able to recognize where God is moving,
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.300]   what he is doing, what he has done.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.440]   That is just so crucial.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.700]   From the bottom of my heart,
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.400]   it breaks my actual heart to think
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:36.000]   that some of us do carry this concept of,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.240]   where is God, because I don't see the big,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.440]   and I know that's probably a lot of us here.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.200]   I know it breaks God's heart
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.520]   that we can't see his activity.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.720]   And so today, as we enter into a time of prayer
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.920]   and into a chance to respond,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.720]   I believe what the Holy Spirit wants to do
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.480]   is reposition us to become people who are alert,
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.040]   who are aware.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.140]   The Holy Spirit wants to help you see
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.540]   what you've not been able to see before,
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.240]   that God cares about the details about your life.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.400]   God cares about the small.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.620]   There's a passage that says that he knows
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.840]   the number of hairs on your head.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.240]   That passage goes to show you
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.360]   that he's aware of the small, of the details.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.720]   We serve an intimate God
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.440]   who walks with us through all seasons of life,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.880]   who has an arsenal of ways to provide for us,
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.800]   and I don't want us to miss out on that provision
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.540]   because we only saw the big
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.640]   or because we're outside of community.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:42.140]   What does it look like to take a step today?
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:49.160]   What does it look like to choose to say thank you,
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.160]   to actually see that, man, God has been constantly at work
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.900]   providing for me day in and day out?
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:03.040]   God has been working.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.600]   How can you become better at recognizing it?
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:12.840]   How can you become better and more aligned
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.080]   to his design of community in your life?
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.440]   Father, we thank you for your word.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.040]   We thank you for these examples
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.920]   that just show us, again, a clear picture
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:30.680]   of just who you are, of how faithful you are,
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.660]   a faithful God who works and provides
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.640]   even in the small things.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.800]   Faithful you are.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.400]   God, I pray for those of us who are having a hard time
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.840]   seeing your provision in the small.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.800]   Holy Spirit, would you begin to awaken that alertness?
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.140]   Would you begin to show?
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.440]   Would you begin to show us just how often,
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.320]   just how regularly, just how close you are
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.120]   and how often you're providing?
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:02.020]   Would you remind us of where these good things come from?
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.800]   Would you remind us of where the breath
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.240]   in our lungs come from?
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.060]   The source of all good and perfect things.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.700]   God, for those of us who carry hurt,
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.080]   carry brokenness over the idea of community,
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.040]   those of us who are afraid to take a step into community
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.540]   because we're ashamed, because we've been hurt,
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.580]   because we've not recovered from past pains,
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:29.120]   Holy Spirit, would you begin to start working now
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:29.960]   in our hearts?
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.840]   Start mending like you do.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.420]   Start healing like you do.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.060]   Start making the old things new like you do.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.540]   May the idea of hurt in the past no longer hinder your people
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.100]   from being in the place of community
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.600]   that you've called them to be.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:49.400]   God, would you make us a community that is sensitive,
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.720]   that is patient, that is kind, that exhibits your fruit
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.400]   so that when people do come in,
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:00.840]   that we will lift their hands and not judge,
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:04.120]   that we will welcome and not stand back,
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.320]   that we will treat them the way that you've treated us,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.020]   the way that you've welcomed us into your family, God.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.440]   Make us into that type of people.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.940]   Make the vine here in Luncheye the kind of church
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.780]   that's like that.
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:21.340]   We give you glory for all these things.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.100]   God who provides in the big and the small,
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.740]   the God who calls us as a community
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.100]   to experience this provision together,
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.620]   we thank you for these things.
[00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.660]   Why don't you stand, church?
