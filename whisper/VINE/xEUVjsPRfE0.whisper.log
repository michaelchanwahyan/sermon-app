[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   Well, good morning everyone. How are you guys? It is so good to be back. Yes, if you're new to the Vine,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.520]   my name is Andrew, one of the pastors here, and it is so good to be back with you. I've been away for
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.160]   about three and a half weeks. My wife and I, with our daughter Mia, went to New Zealand to visit
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.560]   family, and it was an amazing time. Graham and Lynn, if you're watching, hi, good to see you again.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.480]   That's Chris's parents. They're in New Zealand. New Zealand's an amazing place. If you've never
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.440]   been to New Zealand, I cannot recommend it more highly. It is more than just cheap. I promise you,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.160]   it is beautiful. It's an amazing place, particularly if you go in the winter with the snow-capped
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.320]   mountains. It is fantastic, and we survived quarantine, and we are back. It was nice to be
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.880]   there to visit family, but it is, I cannot describe to you how good it is to be in this room with
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.440]   family today, with each one of you guys reconnecting together with Jesus. And what I have on my heart
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.760]   to share with you guys over the next 30 minutes is, in my opinion, perhaps the most significant
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.200]   ingredients that there is to help you as a human being truly come alive. And if there's one thing
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.480]   that I've kind of dedicated my life to, it is trying to help people to come alive, to feel
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.080]   more alive as human beings, to live the greatest life that they can possibly live. And I think the
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.000]   topic we're looking at today is actually the very pivot point for what's going to help you to truly
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.240]   flourish in life, or to actually find yourself weighed down by the things of life that seek to
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.520]   drain all energy and life out of us. As I was preparing for today's message over the last
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.240]   couple of months, I felt like the Lord speak two words to me that I want to speak over you as we
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.840]   start. And that's the word "release" and the word "restoration." And the topic that we're talking
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   about today, when misused, when not used well, has the power to destroy so much of who you are,
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.120]   has the power to destroy your identity, not just in Christ, but as a person yourself.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.440]   And when that happens, we're in need of restoration. We're in need of the ability
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.400]   for Christ to come in and restore to us the places that the enemy has stolen from us.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.320]   But when used well, the topic that I'm talking about today has the opposite impact. It has the
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.560]   ability to actually release you into the fullness of the person that you were created to be. And not
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.280]   just you, but then through you, release the people around you into the fullness of who they've been
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.880]   created to be. And if that's true, then what I have to share over the next 30 minutes is worth
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.280]   you opening not just the ears of your head, but the ears of your heart. Because what we're going
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.200]   to talk about, I think, has a profound impact on what the future of Hong Kong could look like.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.880]   Because if we are truly people brought alive by the Spirit of God, then through our own ways in
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   which we operate in this world, we can see others filled and alive with that Spirit. And we're in
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.960]   a season where Hong Kong, I think, desperately needs to come alive, to find its feet again,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.080]   to know who it is again. And I believe the power sits in the church to open their mouths
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:30.480]   and to speak life. I want to talk today about the power of words. Your words have incredible
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.280]   power. Let me frame what I want to share about by telling you a quick story. Back in 2008,
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.600]   my wife and I were in New Zealand. We were studying seminary, studying theology to become
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.720]   pastors. My wife's a counselor. So we were training ourselves. And we had a break between semesters.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   It was about a week long. It wasn't long enough to fly back to Hong Kong. So we stayed in New
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.040]   Zealand. And some friends of ours, a couple on campus, they said, "Hey, why don't you come with
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.880]   us? We're going to take a five-hour drive to the northeast of New Zealand. We have a little home
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.080]   there, and we're going to stay there for the week. Why don't you join us and get to explore a new
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.920]   part of New Zealand?" We're like, "This is fantastic. We'd love to do this." So we did a
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.680]   classic student road trip. On the Friday, on the last end of the lectures at like five in the
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.920]   afternoon, we jump in their car and we start to drive. About three hours later, it's kind of like
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.840]   nighttime, and we're starving. And typical students, we did not prepare any food to take with us.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.640]   And we now realize that we're in the middle of New Zealand. And when I say middle of New Zealand,
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.760]   I'm talking about like middle of nowhere, New Zealand. Sheep and nothing else.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   And we're starving. And we're like, "Okay, the next town we come to, no matter how small,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.160]   we're going to find somewhere to eat." And sure enough, about half an hour later,
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.800]   we drive into this small town. I cannot tell you today where it is. I don't remember the name of
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.680]   it. There was probably maybe 1,500 to 2,000 people living in this town. It was a very,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.400]   very small town. And we were driving through the little, small, little main street,
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.880]   desperately looking for a restaurant. And there was only one restaurant in the whole town. And
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.040]   can you guess what kind of restaurant it was? Let me hear it. Chinese restaurant. Of course it was.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.200]   Some Chinese guy had moved to New Zealand, found this town, opened up a restaurant,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.680]   and then realized no one lived there. And not only was it a Chinese restaurant, but this was like a
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.000]   Cantonese Chinese restaurant. You could tell by the way it was decorated. It reminded me of a
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.640]   dai pai dong or a cha cha teng. It was like stepping into Mong Kok in the middle of New Zealand.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.480]   And I was so excited. Not only was I hungry, but I was feeling like I was home again,
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.880]   right? So I get out of the car. We park the car. We get out. I look into the window. Now,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.480]   this is a Chinese takeaway restaurant. There's no one in there. And behind the counter, there's
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.840]   this old Chinese guy. And he must be like in his 80s. And he looked really old. And he looked like
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.560]   no one had visited his restaurant for years. And I thought like, this is awesome. This is my chance
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.880]   to go in there and whip out my incredible Cantonese. I bet this guy's never seen a white guy
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.160]   speak Cantonese. Now, it had one of those, you know, those plastic things that go in front of
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.080]   like little takeaway restaurants to keep the flies out, right? It had those grubby plastic
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.360]   things in front of it. So I'm like, and I jump on in. I'm like, oh,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.920]   Now, this guy, this guy behind the desk, he's like 85 years old, looks at me.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:07:02.880]   And his face just lights up. It's like decades wash off of him. It's like he's suddenly 45 again.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:11.040]   And like this guy is so alive. And his face just starts to smile. And he looks at me, a white guy
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.120]   that speaks his language. And he starts going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.840]   And he starts speaking all this Cantonese to me, not realizing that I've just exhausted all of my
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.240]   Cantonese. And he starts speaking and speaking and speaking. And I'm standing there pretending
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.360]   I know what he's talking about. I'm like, ho, ho, ho.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.400]   After a while, after a while, he stops. He stops and he looks at me. And I figure he's asked a
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.000]   question. And I'm like, hmm. And then he starts again. He's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.720]   He's like having so much fun. He's so alive. And I realize that words matter. Like what we
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.160]   actually say out of our mouths, it communicates something, doesn't it? Like the language we use
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:09.040]   connects with people. And the wonderful thing about creating created humans like we are is that
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.160]   we have the gift of this communication, this gift of language, this gift of being able to open our
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.240]   mouths and say something and enable people to come alive, people to find their youth again.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.960]   I remember standing in that restaurant thinking to myself how amazing it is that although my Cantonese
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.600]   is limited, we were able to connect that way. And I don't know if you've ever thought about
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:37.280]   communication in that way before, but communication unlocks us to the one thing that every human being
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:45.040]   in this world longs for the most. You want to know what that is? Intimacy, connection, being able to
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.720]   feel like you're not alone in the world, feel like someone respects you and loves you and is here for
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.360]   you. If you're married in this room, you'll know how important communication is for intimacy.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.360]   You'll know that when we communicate, sometimes we communicate well and it opens up relationship.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.480]   It opens up a certain connectedness between people when we communicate well. But when we
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.880]   don't communicate well, the opposite happens, doesn't it? It shuts people off, doesn't it?
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   We say the wrong thing, we hurt somebody, we bring them down. It feels like there's a wedge
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.160]   between us. Our ability to use our words with one another will either open us up to the greatest
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.280]   moments of flourishing and intimacy, or it will cut us down or isolate us and it will separate us.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.200]   Now you need to understand that at the very fabric and the heart of creation, God created you
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:40.480]   for intimacy and community. It's not a mistake that the word communicate has an etymology with
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:49.520]   the word community, which also has an etymology with the word communion. So our communion with God
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.440]   and our communion with one another is based out of the ability for us to be in community together.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.200]   And our community together is based out of the positivity of our communication. Communicate
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.720]   well, strong community, we will find communion. Communicate poorly, bad community, and we'll be
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.360]   broken in our communion. Now I want you to follow this. When God created you, He created you for
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.800]   that intimacy. He created you for a communication and language and relationship and intimacy.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.920]   And if that's the case, then the words out of our mouth will either align ourselves to the purposes
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.960]   and promises for which we've been created for, or they will drive us away from it. Do you see why
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:41.840]   words really matter? Every time you open your mouth, you are either aligning yourself and those
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:48.960]   around you with what God says about the world, or you're separating and isolating yourself and
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   people from what God says about the world. And if that's the case, it shouldn't surprise us
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.480]   that when James sits down to write a book to the early church, a book about practical living,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.360]   how we now live, how do we now live that Christ has gone to the cross, raised from the dead,
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.080]   and is now amongst us? How do we now live as Christians in an empire that's trying to oppress
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.120]   us? James says, "Well, you have to understand that the words that will come out of your mouths as
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.080]   Christians will either draw people to Jesus or drive people away." You have to realize that if
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.480]   you're going to be a church in the world right now, James is saying to his church, that what you
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.520]   say out of your mouth will either show people Christ is amongst you, or it will drive people
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:39.760]   away from Jesus. And I think what James was saying to the church then applies completely to who we
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:48.160]   are today. I mean, we're living in a time where people are crying out to say, "What does it mean
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:56.640]   to reshape the Hong Kong for the future?" And I wonder whether we might get a passion in us as
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:05.040]   Christians in this city to really truly weigh the power of our words. And I know this has been a
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.480]   hard three years, because I've been here amongst you, I've lived it with you, we know what it's
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.760]   been like. And I know that there has been a lot of things that have come out of my mouth in the
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.160]   last three years that have not built up, that have actually cut down and destroyed and killed.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160]   And I wonder if you're sitting here, gone through all the things that I've gone through in the last
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.840]   three years, you'll recognize that some words maybe that have come out of your mouth in this
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.280]   time haven't been so great. But I wonder what it would be like to actually walk in the opposite
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:36.960]   spirit in our city in this time. I wonder what it would be like to, like James, say how we now live
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.160]   really matters. And if it really matters, then what we say matters. And if what we say can connect
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:48.320]   people to intimacy and communion with God, then we better weigh the power that comes out of our
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.520]   mouths. I want to shape this a little bit more with you through a passage out of James. You know,
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.000]   James speaks about talk and language and communication in three of his chapters. We
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.840]   haven't got time to look at all of them. I want to just jump to one in chapter three,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.600]   the perhaps the most important, the most foundational one. And in this passage,
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.800]   James has some pretty strong things to say to the church. I wonder if we can read this together.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.280]   I'll start in verse two. Have a listen to this. "We all stumble in many ways.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.160]   If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he's a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   check." In other words, he's saying, "None of us are perfect." I love the way James starts. I'm
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.760]   going to say the same thing to you guys. None of you are perfect. You've all said things that have
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.480]   hurt people. You've had things said of you that have hurt people. If you were able to do it,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.920]   you'd be a perfect person. There was only ever one perfect person. We're all in the same playing
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.960]   field. Does that make sense? Verse three, "When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.240]   them obey us, we can turn the whole animal." Or take ships as an example. Although they are so
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.880]   large and are driven by strong winds, they're steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.200]   wants to go. Likewise, the tongue. "The tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:04.320]   boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by such a small spark. The tongue is also
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:10.640]   a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.720]   course of their life on fire, and it itself is set on fire by hell." Tell us what you really think,
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:22.240]   James. I mean, he's getting right at it here. Everything that comes out of your mouth, it's
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.000]   like a fire, and it sets things on fire, and it's like the fires of hell, he says. Jump to verse
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.240]   nine. "With the tongue, we praise our Lord Father, and with it, we curse one another who have been
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:40.000]   made in God's image. Out of the same mouth comes praise and cursing. My brothers and sisters,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.640]   this should not be. Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring? My brothers and
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:54.960]   sisters, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.480]   fresh water." He's got some pretty strong things to say here to the church because he understands
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.920]   the impact and the power that words have. And he makes the words, and he says, "This is what it's
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.880]   like." He's like, "What image can I give you that helps you understand the power, the destructive,
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.400]   hurting power that words can have on people?" Oh, it's like a fire, and he talks about this
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.240]   whole thing. There's one word in that part of that passage that really jumps out to us.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.560]   It's the word "hell." We don't like to talk about hell. Hell seems uncomfortable as a concept at
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:34.320]   times, isn't it? The idea of the fires of hell, but James grabs that, and he brings it here.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.280]   And I want you to try to understand and try to see what he really means by this. The word
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.080]   "hell" here is a bit of a poor translation in our English to be "hell." The actual word is a
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.640]   Hebrew word used here, although James is writing in Greek, but he uses a Hebrew word here, which
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:55.280]   is "gehenna." Gehenna was the name of an area in Israel, a little bit like how Jerusalem was a
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:02.640]   Hebrew name, Bethlehem's a Hebrew name. Gehenna is a name of an area. The area was southwest of
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:09.680]   Jerusalem, and it was a valley that was a forest. Now, in the Old Testament times, Gehenna was
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.480]   famous for one thing. There was a tribal group of people that lived there that worshipped a god,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:21.440]   a deity called Malak. And the worship of Malak, how you worshipped that god, was through child
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:28.000]   sacrifice. In fact, they called it the "valley of fire." And what would happen is they would set on
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   fire the forest in that place, and when the fire was raging, people were encouraged to bring a child
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.120]   and throw the child on the fire. It was like a rubbish tip of wood and flames and burning flesh.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:46.400]   Apparently, you could smell the rotting, burning flesh for miles around, and if the wind was
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:53.200]   blowing in a certain direction, you could even smell it from Jerusalem. Now, everybody in James's
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.040]   time and those before knew Gehenna this way. This is why James, when he writes, he says, "Imagine a
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:05.920]   great forest set afire by a small flame." Imagine, he says, the fires of Gehenna. And what he's saying
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:13.440]   is this. Gehenna represents for people in that day the very worst of human choices. I mean, you can't
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:20.160]   get any lower than that. I'm going to take my child and burn them alive. It is the representation of
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:27.440]   the worst thing that humans can choose to do. And James takes that imagery and he says, "If we're not
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.920]   careful, what comes out of our mouths, the power out of our mouths, can shape the reality so that
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:42.000]   the worst of human choices can come true." And he's saying, "This is not the way it should be."
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.760]   Now, I know you're sitting there and there's a temptation to assume that you know what I'm
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.400]   going to say in this sermon. There's a temptation to sit there and go, "Okay, Andrew, I get it. I get it,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.480]   right? James is talking about not saying bad things about people. So I'll just modify my
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.320]   behavior a little bit and not say some bad things about people and we're all good, right? Great.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:08.960]   Lunch?" I want you to know that's not what James is trying to say here. James is not passionate
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.040]   about some behavior modification. He's not trying to say to the church, "Just do better."
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.400]   He's trying to, with this imagery and what he's trying to teach here, he's trying to get much
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.560]   deeper than that. He's trying to help them to understand the very foundations and the source
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.120]   of where their words from. Because he believes this. He knows that, yes, the words that you
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.320]   speak out of your mouth can represent the worst of human choices, but they can also do the opposite.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:38.560]   They can also set people alive with the fire of God. They can also bring people into the fullness
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.680]   of their creative power. The words themselves have the ability to go that way or that way
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:51.120]   and his question to the church is, "Which way will it go for you?" And to draw that in, he uses
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:57.760]   another metaphor in verse 11. He says, "Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:03.440]   spring or the same source?" He starts talking about sources and he says, "If you think about a source
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.960]   of water, can both fresh water and salt water come from the same source?" No, it's not possible.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.440]   Thereby, the words that we speak that bring us into life and the words that we speak that bring
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:21.760]   us into death, they come from different sources. He's trying to get the church to think about
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:28.800]   where is the very foundation of words in the first place. And because James wants to take his church
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.560]   there, I'm going to take you there now too. Is that okay? Are you ready to strap yourself in for
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:38.400]   some biblical journey? I know you came to church today, but we're looking at the Bible. Is that
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:50.080]   all right? Let's go right back to the source. Genesis 1 verse 1. "In the beginning, God created
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.640]   the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty." And empty there means this
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:03.600]   in the Hebrew, empty. Darkness was over the surface of the deep and the Spirit of God was hovering
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.480]   over the waters. Notice this. The Bible starts with the idea that there was
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.840]   voidless nothingness in the world, a darkness over the world. Nothing existed at all.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:25.280]   The Spirit of God, God as a deity is there hovering over nothingness. Verse 3. "And God said,
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:33.600]   'God spoke.' God opened his mouth and he used words and he said this, 'Let there be lights.'
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   And there was a light." Now this is a very famous passage. You've heard this probably spoken about
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.960]   a lot. The fact that God opens his mouth and speaks to create probably is not a revelation
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.880]   to you. Here's what I want you to think about. Who is God speaking to? There's no one there.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.600]   It's completely voidless and dark and empty. There's no need for him to speak. He doesn't
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.720]   need to speak to himself. And the question we should ask of a text like this is why does God
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.960]   open his mouth and speak out loud? What is the point of that? It's a little bit like that question
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.800]   when a tree falls over in a forest and no one's around to hear it, does it make a sound?
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.720]   When God speaks out of the void and no one's around to hear God, what's the point? Does it have
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.640]   a point? What is the Bible trying to get at here? That's the question you should be asking as a
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.720]   biblical scholar. And when you ask that question, here's what you find. That there is a reason why
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:38.240]   he spoke because speaking matters to God. Words matter. The Hebrew word for word is the word
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:46.480]   "dabar." Now here's an interesting thing. "Dabar" in the Hebrew means word or thing. Word or thing,
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.240]   which is really confusing in the English because you're like, "Can you make your mind up,
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   please? Does it mean word or thing?" Because those are very different things, right? Every time it
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.840]   shows up in the Old Testament, you'd be like, "Is this a word or thing? Like, what is going on here?"
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.680]   But the reason why is because in the Hebrew language, "dabar" is both. It is both the word
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:09.760]   that you hear and a word that's said, but it is also a physical thing. Words, in other words,
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.360]   in the Hebrew thinking, have materialism to them. There's a material substance to word.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:23.280]   When a word is spoken, it has some materialness to it. This is why when God speaks, something
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:28.720]   happens. When he says, "Let there be light," light happens because there is "dabar." God is "dabaring."
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.840]   He is bringing material, physical things out of the word that he's speaking. Are you following this?
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:40.480]   Have you ever had anyone say this phrase, "Wow, their words had such weight." Have you ever heard
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.960]   that phrase, right? Maybe you've experienced that in your life. "Oh man, their words had such weight."
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:52.080]   That's the Hebrew way of thinking about "dabar" of words. I remember when I profoundly came
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:58.800]   into contact with this concept, I was 14 years old. I was in high school and I wanted to be a
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.840]   cool kid. You know when you're 14, you just want to be cool. But I was skinny, a dweeb, and I had
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.160]   really bad zits. But I still wanted to be cool. And the cool thing in my school was the theater program.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.560]   If you were in the drama club or the theater club, you were the coolest kid in school. All the cool
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.240]   kids did drama. And as you got older in the school, you became more and more into this drama thing,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.640]   and that was the way you were cool. So I was like, "Okay, I don't really know if I want to act, but
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.000]   I'm going to sign up for drama because I want to be cool." Well, one year when I was about 14,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.720]   our teacher, our head drama teacher, who was known across Hong Kong for the drama program,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:40.640]   he wrote his own play. And there was one character in this play. It was quite a main character,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:46.000]   and the character was a mime. And I thought, "This is fantastic. If I'm going to audition for any
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.640]   part, if I'm going to be in a part of a play, I want to be in the part of a mime because I will
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:56.000]   never have to forget my lines." Right? Like there are no lines, right? So that's the perfect thing,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.840]   right? So I sign up for this audition. I have no idea what to expect. I walk into this room,
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.840]   and the room's quite large, and there's a whole bunch of the cool drama kids, the ones who were
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.280]   like 16, 17, 18. They're all in the room. The teacher was there as well. And I walked in,
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.000]   the teacher's sitting behind this desk. It felt like some Hollywood audition or something.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.960]   And he took a mirror, and he places this hand mirror on the stage. I was standing at the back
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.200]   of the stage. And he goes, "Okay, for the next five minutes, I want you to mime your interaction
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:36.800]   with this mirror. Go." I've never acted before. And I'm standing there, I'm looking at this mirror,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.840]   and I'm thinking to myself, "I've got five minutes. What am I going to do?" And immediately,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.720]   here's what went through my head. I'm going to go up, I'm going to grab it, I'm going to pretend
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.280]   it's somebody else's. They're not going to receive it. I'm going to look at it. I'm going to be
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.440]   freaked out at how ugly I am. But as I look at myself more from different angles, I'm going to
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:56.160]   fall in love with myself. So I stepped forward, I picked up the mirror. And as soon as I picked
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.600]   it up, everything in the room disappeared. It was like a transcendent experience, if I can use that
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   language in church. This was long before I knew Jesus. And it was a transcendent experience. I
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.040]   was suddenly in another world, and I was just so absorbed in what I was doing. I couldn't see
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.320]   anybody else in the room. And after about whatever was five minutes, I put the mirror down, and I
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:26.720]   stood back and I looked up. No one in the room made a sound. And the teacher leaned forward,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:34.640]   and these are the exact words that came out of his mouth. "What you just did made me come alive."
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:42.080]   And as a 14-year-old kid, I remember hearing that. I remember thinking to myself,
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.280]   "For the rest of my life, I want to dedicate myself to bringing people alive."
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.200]   And that was before I met Jesus, long before I became a Christian, before I even thought about
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   being a pastor. But now I can stand before you and I say, "Every Sunday, I get to stand up here and
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.760]   do my very best to bring you alive." Because somebody at the age of 14 said something over me
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:08.160]   that had materialism to it, that shifted something, changed something in me, made me a new person,
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.200]   called me into a destiny that I didn't even know I needed to be called into. When God stands before
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.920]   creation, a voidless creation, where no one's around to hear it, He still speaks because His
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:25.520]   words have materialism to them. And I want you to see how that then comes later on in the passage,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:32.080]   in verse 26. "Then God said, 'Let us make man, humanity, in our image, in our likeness, and let
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.600]   them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over the livestock, all over all
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.960]   the earth, over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created humanity in the image
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.920]   of the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, all over all the earth, over all the creatures
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.360]   that move along the ground. So God created humanity in His own image. In the image of God,
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.440]   He created them, male and female, He created them. Then God blessed them and said to them,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.880]   'Be fruitful and increase in number. Fill and subdue the earth.'" Verse 31, "God saw all that He
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.840]   had made and it was very good." The Bible is very clear that there is a flow to God's creative
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.040]   flow. If you're a person in this room, you're a human being. If you're online right now watching
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:19.680]   this, you're a human being. Hopefully, you are not a bot somewhere on the internet. But we're
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.560]   human beings and this is about us. And I want you to see the creative flow that God has here.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:32.560]   It's this, God speaks, He creates, He blesses, and then He pronounces good. He speaks,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:39.600]   "Let me create this group of humans." They come into life, He blesses them and says, "You are good."
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:45.520]   God has this flow of what happens in the power of His creative words and it sets up for all eternity
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.000]   the power that there is. And when God opens His mouth and says something and blesses something,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.320]   creates something, something that is truly good that will flourish in this world. And I want you
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.360]   to see in Genesis that God's not just doing this for Himself, but He's made us in His image and
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:07.200]   then He releases us to do the same. That we also, empowered by God, created in His image, also can
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:14.080]   speak. We can also create. We can also bless and we can also pronounce good. And when we do it, people
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:21.840]   come alive. When we do it, we come alive. It's a wonderful thing. Have you ever wondered why God
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:30.480]   asked Adam to name the animals? He could have had him think the animals, but he asked him to name
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.600]   the animals. He brought the animals in front of him and he said, "That's a lion. That's a bear.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.960]   That's an eagle." Why does Adam do that? Because Adam gets to partake, gets to taste a little bit
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.160]   of what it's like to debar something, to open his mouth and say something and bring something alive
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.040]   and see it become the fullness that God had created it to be. Before it was named, the animal was not
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:59.760]   the fullness that God had created it to be. And Adam partakes in bringing creation alive. That's
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.480]   the power of your words. This is not about some behavioral modification. "Oh, just try harder to
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.520]   not be so nasty." This is James saying to the church. This is me saying to us, the church in
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:18.720]   Hong Kong, that we have been chosen by God to use our mouths to echo in something of the kingdom of
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:26.400]   God and truly bring people alive. But 2000 years later, James writes about the tongue and he says,
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:34.640]   "It's a fire of Gehenna. It's a fire of hell. It's like stinking flesh burning." And the question we
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.320]   should ask ourselves is, what happened? What happened with this picture we see in Genesis
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:48.240]   and the picture James gives us in his book? What on earth happened to the power of words?
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:57.600]   I want you to see something in Genesis chapter 3. Now the serpent, the snake, the enemy,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:02.320]   was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. And he said, I want you to see
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:10.480]   this, he said, he spoke to the woman, "Did God really say, did God really speak, 'You must not
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.000]   eat from any tree in the garden.'" The very first time that we're introduced to the enemy, to Satan,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.160]   the very first thing he does is he speaks and he tries to confound the speech that God had given.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:27.840]   He tries to get Adam and Eve to actually doubt the word that God had spoken, to believe that
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.440]   God is actually a liar. Up until this point in humanity's history, there's only one voice to
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.120]   humanity. One of my favorite preachers, Erne McManus, he talked about this as the frequency
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.600]   of God. He said, "Before this moment, there's only one frequency in the world. That's the frequency
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.720]   of God." And humanity is attuned to the frequency of God and it's bringing them into the flourishing
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.240]   of life. But now in this moment, in Genesis 3 verse 1, a new frequency enters the world.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.200]   And this frequency is trying to do the opposite of what God is trying to do.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:05.520]   And this frequency is tearing apart that human connectedness to God and to one another.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.000]   And what you see in Genesis 3 is Adam and Eve choosing the frequency of the enemy,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.960]   choosing to believe the lie, the word that was spoken there. And in doing that, they align
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:21.520]   themselves to what that produces. You need to know that when God speaks, he creates, he blesses,
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:28.400]   and he pronounces good. When the enemy speaks, he destroys, he curses, and he pronounces death.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.200]   That's what he does. That's what he does right there in that moment. And Adam and Eve,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:39.360]   they align themselves to this new frequency. And in that new frequency, they begin to vibe,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.840]   to resonate with that thing. So they begin to curse one another. They begin to tear each other
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.080]   down in front of God when God shows up. They hide because they realize that they're naked and they
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.920]   feel shame. Shame enters the picture. All of this simply because they've aligned themselves to a new
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:04.800]   voice, a new word. And this is really a critical thing because when James talks about the different
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.960]   sources of water, he's bringing them right back to this Genesis creative moment. And he's saying,
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   "Which one are we actually aligned with?" Because guess what? When you open your voice,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:20.400]   what you will say will either resonate with the frequency of God in the world,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.080]   or it will be in dissonance to the frequency of God in the world. What you say, what comes out of
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.280]   your mouth, will either align to it or it will go against it. James is saying, Genesis is saying,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:35.520]   "There's no middle path here. There's no neutrality when it comes to the power of words.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.160]   They either build up and release, or they tear down and destroy. That's what they do."
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:46.640]   In Genesis 3, there's no Genesis 3b. I wish there was. There's a red pill, a blue pill.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.200]   There's no green pill. There's a frequency of God. There's the frequency of the enemy.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.960]   And James is saying, "What source are you coming from?" And we have to ask ourselves,
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.880]   when we're thinking about the power of our words in our lives, not, "Oh, I need to behave a little
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.640]   bit better." We need to ask ourselves, "What am I linked to? What is the source that's flowing
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.880]   through and in me that's creating whatever it is that's coming out of my mouth?
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:22.480]   Is there any hope against the fire of Gehenna?" Well, Scripture gives us one. I want you to see
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.960]   something pretty profound. Is this helping people? I want to show you something pretty
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.520]   profound in John chapter 1. This is John, disciple, writing to the early church, trying to describe
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:38.480]   Jesus, helping them to understand who Jesus is. Notice the language he uses. John 1 verse 1,
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:44.320]   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.600]   from the beginning. Through Him all things were made. Without Him nothing was made that has been
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:55.520]   made. In Him was life, and that life was light to men. The light shines in the darkness, but the
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:01.440]   darkness has not uncovered it." John starts by saying, "Let me tell you the creation story again,
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.840]   but I want you to understand that this Jesus was that Word, that the Word that was spoken was Jesus
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.160]   involved in creating. Nothing has been created. You have not been created without God saying,
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:18.960]   'I want you to exist,' without God having debarred you. He spoke and you came into being."
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:25.040]   When God speaks, if you want to understand the voice of God, if you want to understand
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.400]   the frequency of God, if you want to know what God says, if you want to know what He's passionate
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.320]   about, if you want to know what God is saying to the world, then you have to look no further than
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:39.520]   Jesus, because Jesus is the debar of God. He is the complete manifestation of the fullness of the
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.640]   physicality of what God says. If you want to know what's on God's heart, what God means in this
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:51.760]   world, why God speaks, look at Jesus. His actions, His words, His thoughts, His life is the perfect
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:57.600]   material expression of the Word of God. Does that make sense to you? Which is really crazy,
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.800]   because in verse 14, John says this, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling amongst us."
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:08.480]   He says, "Words have the power to become flesh." Now that might sound like Christian language to
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.400]   you, but when you put it into the Hebrew context that I've been telling you about over the last
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:18.880]   20 minutes, you'll understand this. Hebrews believed that words had flesh, and now God's
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.440]   Word has taken flesh. And you need to understand today, words still have flesh.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:33.760]   There are some of us in this room where some of the words that have been spoken over you are words
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:39.520]   like this, "You're not good enough. You're never going to amount to anything."
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.200]   Those words have been spoken by loved ones and people you cherish,
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:51.040]   and those words have hurt you deeply, and those words have shaped and formed you,
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:55.440]   and those words have become flesh, and that flesh is you.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:01.040]   Some of you in this room, somebody told you once you were ugly.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.480]   Maybe it was when you were younger, and that's gone into your heart and your life.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.640]   And every single time you look at a mirror, no matter how amazing you might look,
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.400]   you just see the flaws, the imperfections, the things that are not right about you.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:21.360]   Somebody said those words over you, and those words took flesh, and that flesh has become you.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:26.800]   And when we see it like that, we think to ourselves, "Man, that's full on."
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:33.920]   But Jesus comes to say, "There's another narrative. There's another frequency. You
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.480]   were not created for the frequency of death. You were created for the frequency of life.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.360]   You were not created for the frequency of shame. You were created for the frequency of acceptance.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.440]   You were not created for the frequency of hate. You were created for the frequency of life,
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:52.480]   love, flourishing, fullness. That's what you've been created for."
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:59.120]   And if Jesus, who is the Word of God, comes and dies on that cross, is raised again for our sins,
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.920]   for our brokenness, for that darkness, if we are embedded in the frequency of the enemy,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.120]   we have one who is the frequency of God, who's come to this world and shown us how we now
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.880]   realign ourselves to the only frequency that we need, the only one that we were ever created for.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:21.120]   There's no third neutral path. And thank God that Jesus came as the Word
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.040]   to reveal to us the frequency of God and welcome us back to resonance with Him.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:33.680]   So how do we silence the frequency of the enemy in our lives?
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.880]   Let me give you two minutes and we'll close. How do we silence the frequency of the enemy?
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:48.240]   Because he's around us all the time. Jesus, when He's thinking about the source of our words,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.920]   James, when He's talking about the source of our words, He talked about saltwater and freshwater.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:59.520]   They can't come from the same thing. Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount in Luke 6, verse 45,
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.760]   said something similar. Listen to this. He says, "The good person brings good things out of the
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:09.440]   good stored up in their heart. But the evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:16.560]   their heart. For out of the overflow of their heart, the mouth speaks." Jesus says, "You want
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.880]   to know what the source is for the words that come out of your mouth? It's your heart. Out of the
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.560]   overflow of your heart, your mouth will speak." This is not about some behavioral modification.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.880]   It's not about trying harder. It's not about going like, "Oh, I just better not swear so much."
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.040]   This is about recognizing, "What is my heart soaking on? What is my heart doing? Is my heart
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.480]   healthy? How does my heart align to the frequency of God? Is there stuff in me that's made my heart
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.400]   unhealthy?" Because out of the overflow of my heart, the mouth speaks. The health of your heart
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.080]   will determine the grace of your words. The health of your heart will determine the grace of your
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:58.480]   words. If your heart is unhealthy, if it's aligned to the wrong thing, the only thing that's going
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:04.720]   to come out of your mouth is a dissonance to what God is saying in the world. There are two things
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:14.080]   that make our hearts unhealthy, sin and hurt. I love this. When Peter writes to his church,
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.760]   and he describes his best friend, Jesus. You know how he describes him? He says this in 1 Peter 2:22.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:27.440]   He says, "There was no sin in him, and no deceit was found in his mouth." Isn't that profound?
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.760]   This is Peter recognizing the power of words. The reason why Jesus had no deceit in his mouth,
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:39.840]   never lied, never slandered, never pulled down, never hurt, never destroyed, never killed,
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.280]   is because he had no sin. The only one who's that perfect person that James was talking about
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.000]   at the start of our passage. When you're perfect that way, you're always going to speak good.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.560]   But the reality is we know that our journey is different to that. And what Jesus, what Peter,
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:00.480]   I think, is saying here, what James is trying to get at is if we're aligned to a source,
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:06.880]   that doesn't have to be our source. And if sin is a reality for us, as it is for all of us,
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:12.960]   our ability to confess and repent and walk in openness with God, embrace his forgiveness and
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:18.480]   know that forgiveness is part of our releasing of our hearts to the source and the frequency
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:23.040]   of God's love again. And as we do that, as we make that our Christian practice, as we have a
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:29.680]   discipline in our lives of confessing him, we'll find ourselves more aligned to the resources of
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.920]   life and love and forgiveness and grace and mercy, justice, the things that the world needs to see.
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.160]   And so the first thing we have to do is check our hearts. Some of you in this room,
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.080]   words that come out of your mouth are bitter and angry and are tearing people down,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.560]   and you don't want to be doing it. But the reality is there's some unconfessed darkness
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.760]   and sin in you. And some behavior modification is not going to fix that.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.040]   Just trying harder is not going to fix that. It's the source that's the issue.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.880]   And the beautiful thing about the Christian faith is that we get to come to Christ,
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:12.960]   the true forgiver and redeemer and store of all things. And in his grace, we don't get an angry
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:21.920]   schoolmaster wanting to pick on us. We get one who loves us, died for us, the word of God dying for us
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:28.240]   so that we might find the word of life in us. There's darkness in your heart, confess and
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:34.480]   repent today and he will meet you. The other thing is hurt. Hurt will cause an unhealthy heart as
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:41.360]   much as sin. The reality is hurting people hurt people. And each one of us have had words spoken
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.560]   over us. You're not good enough. You're ugly. You're never amount to something. I can't stand
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.240]   you. You're a failure. We've had words spoken out of us that have deeply hurt us and entrenched us
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:57.920]   in a narrative and a frequency that we were not created for. And more than that, so often we speak
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:03.120]   words over ourselves that way. We look in the mirror and declare something. We look at test
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:08.480]   results and declare something. We look at our workplaces and declare something about ourselves.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:15.360]   That is not how God sees us. And if you're here today and hurt is keeping your heart unhealthy,
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:22.080]   then the good news is that you're in the place where we have a God who didn't just say,
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.040]   "Let there be light." And there was light, but a God who can debar on you right now.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.840]   That no matter how hurt you might feel, no matter how broken you might be,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.480]   no matter how far from God you might feel right now, he can speak a new word.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.320]   Because his words have life. And he can align you to the frequency of his healing and restoration
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:52.960]   and love right here in this moment. And the question is, are we going to, like that Chinese
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:58.480]   man in that restaurant, are we going to use our words to bring others to life again?
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:05.520]   Or are we going to use our words to connect to the narrative of our city in this time and just be
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.960]   negative, negative, negative, and negative? I'm tired of hearing negative things said about this
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.840]   city. We all know there are challenges in Hong Kong. We all know that those challenges are serious
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:23.280]   and they're political and they're COVID. We're all aware of it. But I wonder whether we might
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:29.520]   commit ourselves to bringing life. Wondering whether we might be willing to overcome our own
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:34.800]   sin and our own hurt and rise up in this time and truly speak some words of life to this city.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   I wonder if we could pray. Let's pray. I wonder whether you could stand with me
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:48.640]   and I want to pray over you.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:44:09.920]   Holy Spirit, we're so grateful. We're so grateful for your mercy.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:14.000]   We're so grateful for how you created us.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:23.520]   We're so grateful for the way in which you spoke, created, blessed, and said, "This is very good."
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:30.240]   Lord, I want to pray that you would silence the frequency of the enemy over this city
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:37.680]   in Jesus' name. I want to pray, Lord, you would silence the frequency of the enemy over this church
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:44.800]   in Jesus' name. Lord, I want to pray you would silence the frequency of the enemy over people
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:54.960]   in this room in Jesus' name. You are not created for death. You are not created for curses,
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:00.720]   for words that destroy and pull down. You were created for life and life abundant.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.800]   It doesn't mean that your life's going to be perfect or easy all the time,
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:12.960]   but it does mean that God has created you to vibe and resonate with his frequency.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.240]   And when you do that, you will find yourself fully alive
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.960]   and wanting to bring others around you into a place of being fully alive.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:28.400]   Holy Spirit, I pray that you would come for those who are steeped in sin in this time.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:35.280]   Lord, we know. Lord, we know the challenges that we have. We know the sin that is in our front door,
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.200]   the one that lurks in our bedrooms, behind our computers,
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:46.800]   the one that is just in present in us in our workplaces. Father, you know the sin we struggle
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.520]   with, the one that so easily entangles. And we ask by the power of your spirit right now,
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:57.440]   Lord, that we would confess that sin to you. We would be courageous enough. I want to challenge
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:04.480]   you this week to be brave. If you want to really, truly speak God's words in your life,
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:11.120]   you need to deal with your sin. The spiritual discipline of repentance and forgiveness is a gift
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.080]   It's not a burden.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.600]   It is the one thing that will release you into the greatest amount of life that you could ever have.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.720]   I want to pray that you would have the bravery this week
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.000]   to confess your sin.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.080]   For those of us in this room who are hurt right now, feeling hurt,
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:35.520]   wrestling with hurt, who have had words spoken over us that are just difficult, that have really, truly shaped the course of our lives.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:40.080]   Father, we recognize that, Lord. We know that
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.840]   we know, Father, that that happens. It's happened to me many times.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.360]   Father, we want to pray for freedom in the house.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:54.000]   We want to pray for release, Lord, of the enemy's strategies to hold people back to the destiny God created them for.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.920]   I want to pray for healing and restoration for anyone in this room, Lord.
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.840]   Anyone online right now, Lord, that is desperately in need of a new word.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:07.200]   I want you to know that God is still speaking. He didn't speak at the beginning of all things and then shut up.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:13.600]   He is still speaking. He is a speaking God, and He can speak over you right in this moment.
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:19.040]   Wherever that deepest part of the hurt is, He can speak the opposite word that was spoken over you.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:28.640]   And I believe He wants to speak that to you today. And I believe that will be a realignment of the source,
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.240]   salty water becoming fresh again.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.440]   So I pray that you would just open your hands now and just allow the Holy Spirit to say whatever He needs to say to you.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.520]   I want to encourage you, if you came with people that you trust and know, you can
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.200]   maybe reach out and ask someone to pray for you in this time of worship and ministry.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.640]   This is the kind of word that we're not supposed to just hear and go away and have some nice dim sum
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:59.040]   or some char siu fan. This is the kind of word that you are to marinate on a little bit.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:05.200]   Invite some people to sit with you with, to pray, to do some work with the Holy Spirit on.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.480]   And whether you do that work here or do it later, I don't mind. But I want to encourage you to invest
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:16.720]   in what the Holy Spirit might be saying to you now. Let's take some time to do that as we respond to worship.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   Respond to worship.
