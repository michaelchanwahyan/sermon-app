[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Well, it's good to be with you all this morning.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Can I ask you a question?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Who's been enjoying the How We Now Live series over the last few weeks?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Yeah?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   I think as I've been reading through the book of James, one of the observations that I've
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   had has been this.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   The way that the man writes this epistle is literally a straight up, in your face, schoolyard
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   fight.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Right?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I mean, the man does not mince his words at all.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   And I'm pretty confident that if we were to sit down with the Apostle Paul, sorry, with
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   James, if that was possible, and you were to ask him any question at all, you would
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   definitely leave that conversation with his full unfurling of everything that he felt
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   about a controversial topic that the church is facing today.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Right?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   He would just let that all out.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And I think if we were to compare that to some of the other writers of the New Testament,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   like if we look at that maybe in the sense of Apostle Paul, and I was to give you like
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   a modern day maybe motivational speaker comparison between the two, I would say this.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I think that James is a David Goggins to Paul's, I don't know, maybe Tony Robbins.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Right?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And if you don't know who David Goggins is, let me just say this.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   He is an ex-Navy SEAL who is certainly not afraid of using some energetic language to
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   help motivate you.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Okay?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And if you want to learn a little more about that, I would encourage you to talk to Pastor
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Allison after the service, and he'll be able to send you the link to his top 10 favorite
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   YouTube videos of David Goggins.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Okay.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Well, as we continue our series today, we're going to turn our attention to a topic which
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   has really been critically important to the Vine, and it really has been since the beginning
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   of our church.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And it's been a critical subject for us because we really believe that this is something that
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   matters for all of us as Christians.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And that topic centers on the question of how do we treat the poor and marginalized
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   in our society.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   And to help us to begin to unpack this a little bit, I want to start by telling you about
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   an interesting conversation I had with a friend a couple of months ago.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   A very heady and intellectual conversation started around a simple question.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Would you rather?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Would you rather be one of the uber wealthy in their weird race to space or an ex-tech
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   finance person who is giving a bunch of their personal money to philanthropic causes?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   All right.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   In the first group, we have the Elon Musks.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   We've got the Jeff Bezos.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We have the Richard Bransons who are engaged in what I'd imagine to be, you know, somewhat
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   of a bit of a weird egotistical race to space.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But, I mean, at the same time, they are pushing frontier science, right?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   They're leading innovation, they're developing some technology which has the potential to
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   drastically change our lifestyles.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   But at least in my mind, there's also this weird little tension that they're using a
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   massive amount of financial, logistical, and human resources which maybe, just maybe be
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   better utilized in addressing some of the big problems that we have here on our planet.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   All right.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   To be fair, Tesla has done more in generating a large-scale shift towards the electric car
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   than any other company, okay?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And Jeff Bezos, I mean, he's made it so much more easier for me to shop conveniently on
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Amazon and something I'm genuinely grateful for, being able to listen to a bunch more
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   audio books, right?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   But then we have Richard.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And if I'm honest with you, I don't actually know what Richard's done for humanity.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But, I mean, I know he's given us an airline and I think there was maybe a phone company
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   in there somewhere as well.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But if you're a Brit, can you please come up and let me know what has Richard Branson
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   done for humanity so I can fill that in for the 2 p.m.?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   That would be amazing.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   In the second group, we have the other side of the coin.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's the Bill Gates.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's the George Soros's.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's the Mackenzie Scott's.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You know, people who, after having their own successful careers, are now investing a significant
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   amount of their personal wealth into philanthropy causes that span across things like health,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   poverty alleviation, education, social enterprises, and human rights.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And this group, for me, this is, as the justice and missions pastor, it's so much easier for
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   me to associate with, right?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I'm totally on board with the focus that they have on developing solutions that support
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   the personal and societal health of humanity and our planet.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So in my mind, at least, in this discussion that I was having with my friend, there was
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   very little room for argument.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That was until he asked me, I thought, a very interesting question.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   When we look at the second group and some of the work that they're involved in, right,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   while there has been some incredibly transformative work that's been happening, some of the problems
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   that they've been facing on have been plaguing humanity, well, since the beginning of time,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   right?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Exploitation, pollution, racism, hunger.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So his question to me was this, what makes you so confident that the impact that they
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   are going to have is going to last even more than one lifestyle?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Because at least, at least if the other team was to colonize Mars, we've got a second planet
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   that we can go live on.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   So let me ask you this question this morning, but I'm going to do it with a little bit more
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   focus on the topic that we're going to engage with.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Would you rather, as a Christian, be trying to lead space exploration or solving the developmental
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   problems of our world?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And what factors would you change if you had to consider this question through the lens
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   of being a Christian as opposed to space heroes?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And I feel like there's a very interesting tension that exists in that for us, especially
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   in the light of the series that we've been exploring how we now live, right?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Because if we look at this particular area today of how do we handle the issue of poverty
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   when we are living in an incredibly rich city of Hong Kong?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   In many ways, navigating this type of question is exactly what James is trying to answer
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   in his letter to the early church, right?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And like so many other letters in our New Testament, James wrote this to a dispersed
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and persecuted church that was learning to wrestle with difficult questions on the merging
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   of culture and societal norms with their faith, right?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Instead of adopting the Greco-Roman habits and practices from their surrounding environment,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   James has been calling this group into a continuation of what Jesus' calling was, which was a new
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   way of living that should ultimately transform how they see the world and each other.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And in his very pragmatic, no-nonsense style, he was saying to them that if their faith
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   was truly alive and genuine, then the internal transformation that the gospel was doing in
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   their hearts, that should be flowing out into their life, the choices that they make, their
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   actions, their attitudes, and the words that they speak.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So today we're going to explore the connections between this and how we see the issue of poverty
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   in the light of Book of James.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Because as we'll see a little bit later on, one of the most prominent issues that the
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   early church was wrestling with was how to handle the cultural divides between the powerful
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   and the influential and the poor, which society had long deemed to be the undesirables.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And we're going to do that by looking at a passage from chapter 2 and see how James addresses
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   this issue.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So I'm going to pick it up from verse 1.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   "My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   of glory.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   man in shabby clothing also comes in, and if you pay attention to the one who wears
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   the fine clothing and say, 'You sit here in a good place,' or you say to the poor
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   man, 'You stand over there or sit at my feet,' have you not made distinctions amongst
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   yourself and become judges with evil thoughts?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to them, to those who love him?"
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   He goes on a couple of verses later to pick it up from verse 8.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   "If you really fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, you shall love your neighbor
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   as yourself.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   So we can see in this passage straight away that James is addressing a situation in the
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   church where its own members were separating themselves based upon the appearance of wealth
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and prestige.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And we've heard this being highlighted through a number of different messages over the years
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   here at the Vine.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   In the Greco-Roman environment, when it comes to caring for others, society basically placed
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   zero expectations on the rich and the powerful to care for the poor.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   In fact, when the rich did give, their generosity was almost always towards their own people,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   their own family, their friends.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You know, the joy of giving in this age was less about an altruistic philanthropy and
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   so much more about the associated benefits that came from giving, things like honor,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   prestige, fame, status.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   For the rich, giving to the poor benefited them very little.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   So their generosity was almost always directed towards those who they could expect a favor
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   from in return.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Does any of this sound familiar to you?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Because I think if we take this context and we lay it over some of the areas of society
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   today, these prejudices are something that we are still trying to come to terms with.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   One of the benefits that we have of living in a media or the digital age is that we are
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   constantly aware of the plight of the poor and the disadvantaged, both here in Hong Kong
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   and our own city, but then also globally.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   It's literally impossible to insulate ourselves from the reality that the world is full of
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   people who are living at a subsistence level.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   We live in a city where the poor and the wealthy often live right side by side.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And although Hong Kong is famous globally as being an international financial city, the
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   reality is that we have people in need right here on our doorsteps.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   A group of us from the Vine and Branches of Hope team have been recently reading a fantastic
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   book written by HKU professor Paul Yip, Social Unrest and the Poverty Problem in Hong Kong.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And one of the areas that he covers is the history and evolution of poverty in Hong Kong
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   over recent decades.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And I want to actually share with you some of the data that he uses to shine a light
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   on this issue here in our city.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   On this graph here, you're going to be looking at the percentage of people who are living
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   in poverty using the Hong Kong's government's definition, which is based upon household
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   income and family size.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And what you're seeing in this graph is that even after the incredible economic prosperity
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   that our city has had over the last 40 years, the number of people who are living in poverty
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   is rising.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And COVID hasn't helped the situation that much either at all.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   In 2021, the poverty level was sitting at 23.6% of our population, which is the highest
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   level since the admission actually set that official poverty line back in 2013.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   If I was to put this in really sort of basic practical terms, in Hong Kong, it's almost
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   one in four people who are facing the reality of living in poverty.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And this isn't just about the small minority groups or the refugees and asylum seekers.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Even though they do carry a significant injustice here in our city.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   This also includes our local Hong Kong population.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   And where it gets a little bit more troubling is not only has poverty increased, but we
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   also see that the top 20% of income earners have actually been able to capture a much
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   larger portion of our city's economic prosperity.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And that has had the effect of squeezing both the people below the poverty line, but also
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   the middle class, as they struggle to be able to afford the increasing cost of living, things
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   like housing, education, health services.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So in this graph behind me, you can see that the top two blue and red lines, they actually
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   represent the income of the top 20%.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And the bottom lighter blue and yellow line, that is the income share of the people who
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   are living in the bottom 10 and 20%.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So over a period of time, we're actually starting to see more of a divergence between
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   these two different groups and their income sources.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So as you can see, just as poverty was a significant issue in the early church, it is still something
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   that we are dealing with today.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And as we go a little deeper into this passage, we're going to look at how some of the habits
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   which James recognized had to be reshaped just so that the church could learn how to
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   care for those in need.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And at a foundational level, that reshaping really come back down to the cultural divides
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   that existed between two different groups of people, the rich and the poor.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Because instead of breaking down some of the barriers that judged and discriminated, the
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   church was actually starting to buy into that Greco-Roman practice by giving favor or preferential
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   treatment to the people based on temporary physical benefits.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Those perceived as rich and prosperous were treated with a respect and they were welcomed
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   into the services, while those who were less fortunate, I mean, they may have been allowed
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   in, but they are expected to stay in a very specific place that was reserved for the poor.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Instead of pausing to understand and respond with compassion to some of the struggles of
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   people in need, the church was creating situations where the needy were being left out and made
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   to feel unwanted.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Instead of modeling the new way of how Christians were supposed to be living, they are instead
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   discriminating and excluding the vulnerable within their own community.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And just to see how tragic that really is, one of the things that we have to understand
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   is that the church was meant to be one of the very few places where that gap between
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   the rich and the poor didn't exist.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   The wealthy business owner and the low-skilled day-wage worker, they should have been able
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   to sit together as equals in the kingdom of God, knowing that they were both created in
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   His image.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   So James's call to the church was really to model a new way that reflected God's desire
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   for a caring and inclusive society.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   It was a call for believers to build that new community within their own cities that
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   would be impartial, welcoming, and responsive to the needs of people around them.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And we also see that Paul addresses the same thing in some of his letters as well.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So this isn't just something that James is picking up on.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   During the Lord's Supper Feast, the wealthy would tend to have this habit of physically
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   separating themselves from the poor and eating together almost in their own little exclusive
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   society.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   The upper class, who would often arrive to these feasts much, much earlier than the much
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   larger group of poorer people, they would come together and they would start to eat
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   before the poor arrived.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   They would consume the majority of the food, drink all the wine, and then leave in this
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   drunken state, leaving the poor humiliated and without enough food to eat.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And all of that occurred around the dinner table, a space which God uses on so many occasions
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   in the Bible to illustrate a place of welcome and acceptance.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   In a space where generosity was meant to be overflowing for the other person, they judged
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   and created division between themselves and the other.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Instead of seeing them as heirs to God's kingdom, people saw the poor and gave them a lower
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   value, withholding their time and their resources.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Instead of being generous and caring, the alternative society that Jesus had intended
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   that church to be, it was starting to look more and more like the society around it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Which brings us to a really important question for us to reflect on in our age.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Do we see that same lacking of a generous spirit in our own city?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Are we really doing that much better than the early church that James and Paul were
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   addressing?
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And the cool thing is, I actually have some data that gives us an insight into this as
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   well.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   The Charities Aid Foundation puts together a mostly annual report on the giving habits
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   of countries around the world.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And they do this by looking at the percentage of a country's population who practice three
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   different types of generosity.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   And they do it by asking a question simply, in the last month, have they helped a stranger
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   or someone they didn't know who needed help?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Have they donated money to charity or have they volunteered their times to an organization?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And the good news for us is that Hong Kong has been part of their research.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   So we actually get a very interesting little insight into how our city has been responding
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   into these different areas over the last decade now.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   The not so good news is that, as you will see on these graphs here, is that our generosity
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   has actually dropped significantly across all three different giving habits.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   And in that top left-hand graph behind me, you're going to see that our global ranking
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   actually went from being in the top 26 countries in 2015 right down to the bottom 10 in 2021.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And what I find particularly relevant, I think, to the passage that we're exploring today
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   is the decline that we're seeing in the percentage of people who are willing to help a stranger
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   and volunteer to serve others.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Those bottom two graphs there.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Because if we combine these different giving habits with the growth of poverty in Hong Kong,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   I think it starts to unpack for us a very troubling trend.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Poverty has increased, wealth has become more concentrated in the hands of the few,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   and the majority of our society have been stepping back from caring for those who are most in need.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And that paints a very sobering picture that something is seriously wrong with the way
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   that we're operating.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And I don't mean to downplay some of the difficulties that Hong Kong has been facing
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   over the last couple of years.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   It has been an incredibly unsettling period for us.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   I think if we just look back at the last two, two and a half years now,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   with some of the COVID restrictions, while that has undoubtedly saved a lot of lives,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   it's also shut off so many opportunities that we actually have to be able to serve
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   the people who are in need.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   And I think NGOs are particularly carrying this burden.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   They haven't been able to do the same amount of awareness-raising events.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Their financial resources have been lower, so they've been impacted in types of programs
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   that they can do.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And even some of the social restrictions that have come out because of COVID have limited
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   their ability to actually even interface with some of the different communities
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   that they exist to serve.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   So it brings us to a point where there's a really difficult question, right?
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   What do we do about this?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   How do we actually know about how do we reverse some of the decline that we're seeing
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   over the last few years?
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   All right, poverty is obviously a very complex situation, right?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   And its solutions are also extremely complicated, right?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And even though there is a lot that does sit outside of our control, and I think one of
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   the temptations that we face is that we look at the size of this type of thing,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and we think about, like, you know, the role that I can play in this is so small
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   that I can't impact it.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   But I think I want to encourage us today to look at it this way, because even though
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   there is that much which is outside of our control, we certainly aren't powerless
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   in our response.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   In fact, we find one of the most impacting responses that we can take in verses 3 and 4
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   of this passage that we've been reading through today.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   James writes it as this.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Let me remind you.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   "If you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, 'You sit here
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   in a good place,' while you say to the poor man, 'Sit over there or sit down at my feet,'
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   have you not made distinctions amongst yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?"
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   What I think James is ultimately asking the church in this question is this.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Where and how have you been discriminating against the other?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Do we prefer to only socialize with people who are similar to us?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Those who have similar jobs, incomes, world views, fashion preferences, political affiliations,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   whatever it may be.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Do we tend to avoid or exclude people who come from a different racial background or ethnicity?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Do we try to create a separation between ourselves and those with a different sexual orientation?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Do we actually end up moving to a different part of the train or the MTR when someone
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   who is dealing with some mental health issues starts getting just a little bit too loud
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   around us?
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   The challenge for all of us is to ask ourselves, "How much of what we see in the change of
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   our city's giving habits, our hesitancy to help a stranger, or be giving of our time
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   and our resources, how much can that explain by the same reason that James is calling out
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   here in the early church?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   That strong preference to care for our own, the people like us, our families, our friends,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   but at the cost of ignoring the other.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   See, part of this, I think it's completely natural.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   It is a good thing to care for your family and people in your immediate sphere of influence.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   But the point that James is making here in this passage is that we are called to love
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   our neighbors as ourselves.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   In other words, with the same passion and focus that we take care of those in our own
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   family, we should be looking to find ways to extend that externally.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   And when James writes these attitudes of judgmental, evil, dishonoring, sinful, he's really calling
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   out the behaviors of self-interest that had crept into the lives of the believers and
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   was starting to unwind the community that God ultimately desired the church to live
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   within.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Because we were created to be in that community.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Being in community with our Christian family is such an important part of our faith because
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   it's within the context of these relationships that we have the opportunity to give and to
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   receive love and forgiveness, to encourage and challenge each other in our faith walks.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And it's also within this space that we get an opportunity to learn about the needs of
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   those around us as well, which underlines why we need to be so careful in treating people
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   differently within our church, but also within our city.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Because when we allow prejudice and discrimination to exist in our minds and through our actions,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   we create these opportunities that are going to protect the behaviors and the privileges
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   of the known and deny others on the basis that we don't believe that they deserve access
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   to the same treatment.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   And that is the antithesis of what a God-centered community really seeks to achieve.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   James goes on a little bit later on in chapter 5, and he shows us that there's not a small
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   cost associated with this type of attitude either.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   The price that people will pay, he likens this to the stupidity of an animal.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   For its own selfishness has intentionally fattened itself just to get ready for its
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   own slaughter.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So coming back to that question, how do we live out these two essential commands that
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   James is bringing to us today?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   To protect ourselves against the temptation to discriminate and to care for the needs
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   of those around us.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   The first step is this.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Do not compromise what God is calling you to do individually, but let me encourage you
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   to find opportunities to put yourself in a position that allows you to see the personal
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   impact that you're having in a wide range of communities.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   James is talking here about the rich and the poor, but I think I would probably extend
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   that a little bit further.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Ethnicity, background, languages, age groups.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Find opportunities, find communities where you don't necessarily agree immediately with
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   the other person.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Just like that question that I asked at the beginning of this message.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   There's always going to be the tensions and uncertainties in navigating how we balance
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   our life choices and the calling that we have to care for each other.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Our world is constantly changing, and none of us have figured out that perfect way to
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   navigate it.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   But I will say this.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Staying connected within community and understanding the needs of the people that are around us
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   and whether or not we're having a positive or a negative impact on them is probably one
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   of the most effective ways to avoid a habit of discrimination.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   It's also the precursor to the next step.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Earlier I showed you two giving habits, which I believe have the potential to break down
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   any walls of discrimination.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Helping the stranger in need and volunteering with an organization.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Serving some of the most vulnerable people here in our city.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   We have Branches of Hope, which is one of the justice expressions here at The Vine,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and you will not find a more easy way to get involved with an organization that is serving
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   some of the most vulnerable here in Hong Kong.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   We also have a wide range of different missions partners here at The Vine as well, both here
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   in Hong Kong and then also globally.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   They work across a range of different issues.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   As a church, we've had the opportunity to be able to connect a bunch of people from
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   our congregation into these volunteering spaces that align with their passions, their skills,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   their interests.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And I want to let you on one little piece of advice or feedback if I can.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   In my experience, and it is my experience as well, the biggest sticking point that really
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   prevents people from living this out is not being intentional about taking that very first
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   step.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   So in this particular space, I want to encourage you not to miss out on what I would say is
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   probably one of the most rewarding experiences of your Christian faith.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Find an opportunity to serve and to help the person in need.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And it also leads us to the last step here as well.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And that's what James calls the royal law or what Jesus gave us as the second greatest
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   commandment, to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And I would say that that probably starts with loving the person who is right next to you.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   One of the wonderful things that we have about The Vine is that we have such a diversity
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   of both social, economic, cultural backgrounds, ethnicity, races right here in the auditorium
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   today.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Over a multitude of Sundays, we'll actually have up to 55 different language groups that
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   attend The Vine as their church.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   So today, rather than rushing out from today's service, why not spend some time trying to
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   get to know somebody who is part of your very own church community but comes from a different
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   background.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   In that sense, don't be the nameless person who turns The Vine.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And don't let the persons who are sitting around you week in and week out also be nameless.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   So across these three steps, I want to actually leave us with a little bit of a challenge.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   As a community of believers, let's be a leader across these different areas, especially in
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   those giving habits, the leader that Hong Kong desperately needs.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Imagine what it would be like if the church was able to play a lead role in reversing
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   some of those trends of declining generosity and bringing people out of the situations
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   that they're facing.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Through that, building that momentum together, we could actually bring back that spirit of
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   generosity that exists within our hearts.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Can I pray for us?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Father, we just, Lord, we come today, we come today not as a group of different individual
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   people, but we come together as your Christian family.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   So Father, I'm just going to pray for this message that we've heard today.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Pray over some of the information that has been shared, the troubling situations that
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   exist here in our city.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   We don't want to downplay that.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Father, also just pray for us in our hearts, some of the practices or habits that we may
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   have had when it comes to having prejudice or discrimination.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Lord, I pray that you just lead us as a community into a space where we learn what it means
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   to follow you and to care for the people around us.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Father, also pray for us as a church, that there would just be a joy, there would be
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   an encouragement, there would be a motivation to be able to step out of this auditorium
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   today and to go and impact the society around us.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   That we would find ways to care for our neighbor, to be able to help the stranger, be able to
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   serve those who are in need.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And that we do that together as a community of God.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Not as individuals, not as carrying that burden by ourselves, but that we would be able to
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   do this together as one big family.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I just thank you for this in your mighty name.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Amen.
