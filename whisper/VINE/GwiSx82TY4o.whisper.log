[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   in Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen, amen.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.940]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.800]   You can have a seat.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.460]   So God has just met Moses at a burning bush.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.600]   God has appeared out of nowhere
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.560]   and into the ordinary everyday moment of Moses' life,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.480]   God comes and creates this burning bush
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.300]   just off in the distance to his right,
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.800]   or maybe it was to his left,
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.260]   but just off there in the distance.
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.980]   And God does it there and not right in front of him
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.800]   because God wants to call him to leave his everyday,
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.460]   to leave his ordinary and to go and see what it is
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.180]   that's burning just over there on the horizon.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.060]   And Moses has to make a choice.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.540]   He has to make a choice to decide
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.500]   to draw towards the extraordinary.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.780]   And I wanna encourage you to be open
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.480]   to making that choice in your life
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.600]   because there are burning bushes
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.300]   that God places around us all the time.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.740]   And maybe for us, they're not like some flame in a bush,
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.220]   but maybe it's somebody that we meet on the street.
[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.420]   Maybe it's a new colleague at work.
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.540]   Maybe it's a moment in a conversation with someone.
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.220]   Maybe we're at a bar or a nightclub or a restaurant
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.540]   or somewhere where we didn't even think God was present.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.380]   And there is a burning bush before us.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.340]   I wanna empower you as people here in Hong Kong
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.540]   to walk boldly towards the burning bushes,
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.140]   to recognize that God often breaks into our ordinary
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.100]   with his extraordinary.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.420]   And when he does, it's chance and time for us to turn
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.180]   and walk and listen and hear.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.460]   And as Moses goes over, God says these words to him,
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.300]   "Don't come any closer, Moses,
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.040]   "for the ground that you're standing on is holy ground."
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.220]   And he invites him to remove his sandals.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.180]   And Moses does so.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480]   And we saw last week that that had something to do
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.440]   with the impurities that Moses had on his shoes
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.560]   and the holiness of God,
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.300]   but it actually had far more to do
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.700]   with God's desire to be an intimate community
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.940]   with Moses again,
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.940]   with God's desire to break through all the things
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.180]   that had happened in Moses's life
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.420]   and meet Moses tenderly, intimately in communion with him,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.580]   taking Moses back to Genesis one and two,
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.460]   where Adam and Eve were able to be naked and unashamed
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.780]   in God's presence before the onset of sin.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.620]   And despite all the sin that had been in Moses's life
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.820]   and was continuing to be in his life,
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.540]   God says, "Remove your sandals
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.580]   "'cause I want you to be naked and unashamed with me again,
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.220]   "that nothing you have done, nothing you have said,
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.260]   "nothing you have lived would ever take you.
[00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.000]   "Nothing is an obstacle
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.900]   "from my intimate relationship with you.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.880]   "I love you.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.020]   "I'm here for you.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.040]   "I wanna connect with you.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.300]   "I want your flesh and my spirit to be together."
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.020]   And God invites Moses into something
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.540]   that he invites us all into,
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.900]   to know that nothing we do can ever hold us back
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.100]   from the grace of God.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.780]   And that God wants to intimately commune with us too.
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.080]   He wants you to be naked and unashamed.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.440]   And Moses's response to this incredible call of God
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.600]   for him to be naked and unashamed before him again
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.440]   is simple words.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.480]   He says, "Here I am."
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.280]   Not kind of like, "Here I am."
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.080]   But, "Here I am.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.680]   "All of me.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.260]   "The good, the bad, the ugly.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.160]   "The me that was for 40 years an oppressor in Egypt.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.620]   "The me that murdered an Egyptian
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.840]   "and thought he could bury it and get away with it.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.040]   "The me that fled because I was in fear of my life.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.120]   "Me that came to a new place
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.200]   "and pretended that I was somebody that I wasn't.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   "All of me, I now step into you.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.560]   "I now bring to you."
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.600]   And it's in this amazing moment of intimacy
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.080]   that God ministers to Moses.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.380]   And it's here at this moment,
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.960]   when God finally calls Moses
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.040]   to what the true purpose of his life was.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.380]   And I need you to hear this.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.640]   Moses was 80 years old.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.880]   Adrian, I need you to hear this.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.080]   Come on, baby.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.320]   Moses was 80 years old at this point in his life,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.620]   just like Adrian was standing here before you right now.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.880]   And God said, "Now is the time for your purpose.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.720]   "Now is the time."
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.200]   Everything that's happened in the last 80 years
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.040]   has shaped and formed you
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.760]   to be the one that I can now use, yes.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.480]   But now is the time
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.160]   that you're about to live out the calling in your life.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.080]   And there are some of you in this room
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.620]   who are older than I am,
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.680]   who think that you're at the end,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.780]   when actually you're at the beginning.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.000]   You're actually at a moment now with all the wisdom
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.480]   and all the life experience
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.780]   and all the gifting and anointing
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.080]   that has been placed upon your life.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.760]   Now God's rolling up his sleeves
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.000]   and he's saying, "Are you ready?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.720]   "Because your purpose is still here."
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.400]   And so for this 80-year-old man
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.080]   who's standing naked before God
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.520]   and for the first time in 80 years, unashamed,
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.740]   God gives him a call.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.460]   I wanna read this to you from Exodus 3, verse 7.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.460]   The Lord said,
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.380]   "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.280]   "I've heard them crying out because of their slave drives
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.020]   "and I'm concerned about their suffering.
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.280]   "So I've come down to rescue them
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.400]   "from the hand of the Egyptians,
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.380]   "to bring them up out of that land
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.560]   "into a good and spacious land,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.920]   "a land flowing with milk and honey,
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.940]   "the home of the Canaanites, the Hittites,
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.020]   "the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites,
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.100]   "the Jebusites, every ite you could ever imagine is there."
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.060]   I love this, God shows up and Moses is removed his sandals
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.260]   and he's communing with God,
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.580]   the naked and unashamed moment.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.420]   And then God begins to speak to him.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.860]   And the first thing he does is he reminds Moses of who he is.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.540]   He reminds him of his heart of compassion.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.660]   And we saw this just a couple of weeks ago
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.700]   at the end of chapter two, when God declares his character.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.960]   And he says back in chapter two,
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   "I have heard, I have remembered, I have seen, and I know."
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.580]   And because of this, if you remember,
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.020]   I drew that out on the whiteboard two weeks ago.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.300]   And because of this, God is saying, this is who I am.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.140]   This is my character.
[00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.580]   I'm a God who hears.
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.540]   I'm a God who remembers.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.380]   I'm a God who sees.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.340]   I'm a God who knows.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.660]   I'm for you, he says.
[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.340]   And then right here, as he begins to minister to Moses,
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.420]   and as he begins to give Moses his call on his life,
[00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.460]   he reminds him of all of this.
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.140]   Notice what it says here in chapter three, verse seven.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.660]   He says, "I've indeed seen the misery of my people.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.200]   "I've heard them crying out
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.320]   "because they're a slave drivers.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.280]   "I'm concerned about their suffering,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.620]   "so I know about their suffering.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.260]   "And now I have come down to rescue them.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.340]   "I'm gonna be faithful to my covenant
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.340]   "of deliverance for my people."
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.940]   He lays it all out there again,
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.540]   because he wants Moses to know
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.600]   that everything God is doing
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.760]   is out of a place of compassion.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.180]   And although God is gonna do more of this later
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.220]   in the journey of Exodus, at this moment,
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.560]   he wants Moses to be reminded
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.260]   that he's not like the Egyptian gods.
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.960]   The Egyptian gods who are a pantheon of gods
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.940]   who have a hierarchy of power,
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.940]   where the Egyptian gods enslave other gods,
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.700]   which therefore makes no sense
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.580]   why then humans would enslave people
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.820]   if their gods enslave people.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.600]   God shows up and says, "I don't enslave people.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.580]   "I actually am turned towards people.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.740]   "My heart is compassion for people.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.980]   "And I hear their cry, and I'm going to act."
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.180]   And Moses, you can almost sense in this part of the story,
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.160]   it's probably like, "Yeah, great, let's go."
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.700]   He's thinking God's gonna go do something.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.740]   He has no idea God's about to call him
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.240]   to the hardest thing.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.640]   He actually says here, he says, "I'm gonna now send you.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.620]   "And I'm gonna go and take the Egyptians
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.240]   "and to bring them up out of that land
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.220]   "into a new and spacious land."
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.060]   This is the first mention of this idea of the promised land
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.460]   that God is gonna do for his people.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.500]   And he mentions two things about this promised land.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.180]   He says, "First of all, it'll be a land
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.920]   "flowing with milk and honey."
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.620]   This is a phrase that will get repeated a lot
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.420]   throughout both Exodus and Deuteronomy and Numbers.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.940]   The idea that the promised land
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.580]   is not actually literally flowing with milk and honey.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.140]   What it is, is it's a place of fruitfulness,
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.320]   a place of great blessing, a place of abundance.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.420]   It's God saying, "I'm gonna take you
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.100]   "out of a place of slavery
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.180]   "and put you into a place of abundance."
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.180]   You need to know that as you come out of the slavery
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.660]   to your sin, your destination is abundance.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.340]   Not abundance financially per se,
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.860]   not abundance maybe even in the things
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.020]   that you might want abundance in,
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.100]   but the abundance in how God sees fruitfulness
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.220]   in this world.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.000]   The abundance of the kingdom of God at work in your life
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.300]   like it never been before.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.820]   Abundance in God's presence with you
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.580]   like you've perhaps never felt before.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.420]   There's always a place of abundance
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.760]   after a place of slavery.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.320]   Come on, church.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.180]   And so as he's journeying his people here,
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.420]   he's saying this land is gonna flow with milk and honey.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.580]   It's like Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.020]   It's like a new garden for you
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.120]   where you're gonna be able to live out
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.740]   what it means to truly be human,
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.300]   where you're gonna be able to go into the earth
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.380]   and subdue it and see it flourish
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.080]   and see it become all that it can be.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.140]   That's ahead of you.
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.060]   But he says something really important.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.620]   He says, "This is the home of the,"
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.220]   and then he says, "Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites,
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.460]   "Parasites," and they're all there again.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.100]   In other words, he's saying, "I have a promise for you.
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.040]   "It's a land that is incredibly fruitful,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.380]   "but right now it's occupied by other people.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.300]   "It's the home of all these other people,"
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.940]   which is really fascinating
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.180]   'cause God is saying, "I've got a promise for you,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.600]   "but there's a part that you're gonna have to play
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.280]   "in receiving of that promise.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.420]   "There's a whole bunch of people there that you're gonna,"
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.740]   now this is right at the beginning of the Exodus,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.260]   and God's gonna talk about this a lot more
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260]   as they go, but even at the start,
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.540]   God's not giving empty promises.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.780]   He's not saying, "Hey, it's a great land.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.680]   "Don't worry, it's gonna be fine.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.500]   "I'll tell you about the rest later."
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.220]   Right up front, he's saying, "No, this is a land,
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.300]   "but it's the home of these people right now,"
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.160]   which means it's a promise that is given to you,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.020]   but it's a promise that's gonna need conquering.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.580]   And it's really important that you understand
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.020]   how the promises of God work in our lives.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.820]   It's very rarely that the promises of God
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.780]   are given to us on a silver platter.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.400]   In fact, the promises of God are actually,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.000]   I think, and over my experience of a number of years
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.200]   of serving Christ, I think the promises of God
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.460]   are the primary way by which God disciples us as his people.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.680]   Because think of it this way.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   So often, when God wants to give us something,
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.120]   something that is so good to us,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.280]   when he wants to do something that's good for us,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.540]   he will demand something good from us.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.600]   And this is because God sees his promises
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.640]   that work in our lives, and he wants to partner with us.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.720]   You know, in the promises of God,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.780]   we are not silent passengers.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.040]   We are active partners.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.560]   Now, be careful here, because that doesn't mean
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.840]   that your strength and your great wisdom and your ability
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.460]   will bring about the promises of God in your life.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.400]   That's not what this is talking about.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.280]   What it's talking about, though,
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.780]   is that you're gonna have to align yourself
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.160]   to the promises that God has spoken over you.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.800]   And that's gonna require three things,
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.520]   obedience, trust, and faith.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.360]   And it wasn't gonna be Moses's strength
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.700]   and Moses's wisdom and all the things
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.160]   that Moses is great at that would get Israel
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.100]   out of Egypt and into the promised land.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.400]   And it wasn't gonna be all those things
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.280]   that Joshua would have that would enable them
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.560]   to conquer the promised land.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.560]   What would enable that was obedience, trust, and faith.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.200]   And some of you in this room, you're struggling with this,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.720]   because you're asking for the promises of God,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.880]   but you're not willing to play your part in those promises.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.600]   And every promise that he will speak over your life
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.520]   will always call you to a deeper level of discipleship.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.560]   It'll always call you to walk in obedience and faith
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.680]   and trust in the promise that God has spoken over you.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.040]   And God is doing this for Moses, 'cause he's saying,
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.760]   "I'm gonna do all this stuff, but Moses,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.240]   "there's a role for you to play here."
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.960]   And God is inviting Moses to be willing to play his part.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.340]   Will you have the obedience and trust and faith, Moses,
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.040]   to walk with me?
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.640]   And I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying to us
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.280]   here in Hong Kong in this hour,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.200]   will you, the Church of Hong Kong,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.360]   have the obedience, trust, and faith
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.400]   to see the 90% of this city who don't know me come to faith?
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.440]   So I think he has a promise over Hong Kong.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.440]   Maybe I'm the only one here
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.960]   that thinks God has a promise over Hong Kong.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.840]   Anyone else think that God maybe has
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.280]   a promise over Hong Kong, right?
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.000]   (congregation applauding)
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.040]   But the church is sorely mistaken
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   if we think God is gonna deliver
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.420]   that promise on a silver platter.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.340]   We need to rise up in obedience.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.120]   We need to rise up in trust.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.720]   We need to rise up in faith
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   if we really wanna see our city changed for Jesus Christ.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.160]   Now, how does Moses reply to this?
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.600]   Notice what he says here.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.560]   He says, it says verse nine, he says,
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.200]   "Now the cry of the Israelites has reached me,
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.540]   "and I've seen the way that the Egyptians
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.340]   "are oppressing them, so now go.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.660]   "I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people,
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.080]   "the Israelites, out of Egypt.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.280]   "But Moses said to God, 'Who am I,
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.820]   "'that I should go to Pharaoh
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.080]   "'and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?'"
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.680]   Moses' honest words, "Who am I?"
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.280]   This portrays two things about Moses.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.280]   The first is he's come a long way.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.600]   'Cause 40 years ago, he was like, look at me.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.960]   40 years ago, he was the prince of Egypt.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.640]   40 years ago, he was clothed in power and prestige
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.560]   so much so that he thought he could kill an Egyptian
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.620]   and get away with it.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.460]   Now, 40 years later, he is so stripped down
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.980]   of all his identity, all his privilege, all of his power,
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.260]   that when God shows up and says,
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.780]   "I'm gonna take you back to Egypt,"
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.060]   he's like, "You should've done that 40 years ago."
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.300]   Can you hear Moses' heart here?
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.940]   Like, I'm nothing now.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.700]   Why didn't you come 40 years ago and ask me to do it then?
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.900]   'Cause then I had power, then I had prestige,
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.540]   then I had influence, now I'm nothing.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.660]   You're 40 years late, God.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.400]   I wonder if anyone in this room feels like
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.780]   the promises of God are a bit late in their life.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.780]   Like if only, God, you had called me 10 years ago
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.700]   when I had that great job and all that money.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.540]   Come on, church.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.380]   So interesting that we put the timeframes of God
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.980]   in our hands and God's like, "No, no, no, no, no, Moses.
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.460]   "You don't realize now is the time
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.260]   "because you saying, 'Who am I?'
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.720]   "is the qualification for me to about to use you."
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.900]   'Cause notice the, "Who am I?" though.
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.060]   There's another thing that's going on here.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.060]   The, "Who am I?" is Moses still thinking it's all about him.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.260]   Whereas before in Egypt, it was, "Who am I?
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.420]   "I'm a power, I have authority, I have prestige."
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.760]   Now he's like, "Who am I?
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.440]   "I have nothing, I'm a shepherd with nothing at all."
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.940]   But he still thinks that the ability for him
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.420]   to live out the call of God in his life
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.060]   is still down to him.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.700]   He's just gone from, "Yeah, I've got all the power,"
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.800]   to, "No, I've got no power," but he's still focused on this.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.640]   "Who am I?
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   "How can I do this?"
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.500]   Basically, Moses is saying, "I am not adequate, God,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.740]   "to be able to do the call that you've placed on my life.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.940]   "I'm not adequate, I don't have the skills,
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.900]   "I don't have the ability,
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.480]   "I certainly don't have the power and prestige
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.320]   "that I used to have.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.060]   "I am not adequate, God,
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.780]   "for what it is that you're calling for me to do."
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:36.740]   Now, here's the reality.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.700]   I think so many of us in this room,
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.100]   that's so often been our conversation with God.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.340]   When God calls us to things,
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.040]   it's so easy for us to say, "I'm not adequate.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.340]   "I don't have the skills to do that."
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.180]   I remember when God called me
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.500]   to be senior pastor here at the Vine.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.280]   My great cry was, "I'm inadequate.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.220]   "I don't have the adequacy to live out this call."
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.460]   And you can ask my wife,
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.180]   "I still feel that way 10 years later."
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.300]   It's a miracle that you come every Sunday.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.640]   Literally, that's the grace of God over my life,
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.020]   that you guys still show up and come here every Sunday.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.360]   'Cause if you understood how inadequate I feel
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.820]   to do what I do, you may not come every Sunday.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.940]   The grace of God is that way.
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.660]   I wanna say something really important,
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.140]   and I'm gonna put it very bluntly.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.600]   When it comes to the call of God on our lives,
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.540]   our adequacy has nothing to do with God's sufficiency.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.800]   Come on, church.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.920]   Has nothing to do with God's sufficiency.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.840]   See, God is sufficient,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.560]   regardless of whether we feel we're adequate or not.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.200]   God's not asking Moses whether he's adequate.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.840]   When God calls you to something,
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.000]   he's not looking to see if you're adequate for it.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.280]   He's not looking at your resume and going,
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.700]   "Oh, this guy's qualified."
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.180]   In fact, I think God chooses people
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.640]   because they're not adequate.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.160]   God calls people because they're not strong enough.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.340]   They're not capable enough.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.820]   They don't have the greatest influence.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.020]   They've not got a great ministry.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.780]   God raises up those that no one else in the world
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.980]   would look at because he looks upon them and he says,
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.580]   "Now this person can be used."
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:15.940]   See, so often in the call of God on our lives,
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.720]   God calls us to something that we are not able
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.680]   to accomplish in our own strength.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.820]   He calls us to something where right now
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.840]   our current resources cannot achieve.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.200]   He calls us, in other words, church, to faith.
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.540]   Because if you are adequate
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.000]   to live out the call of God in your life,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.200]   then you don't need God for his call.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.040]   And this is one of the first things
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.100]   that Moses has to grapple with.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.860]   It's this idea that God is calling him and he is inadequate
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.580]   and that's part of the story.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.740]   Because notice what God says next.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.020]   God says this.
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.020]   He says, verse 12, God said, "I will be with you.
[00:16:58.020 --> 00:16:59.180]   "And this will be a sign to you
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.520]   "that it is I that has sent you.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.280]   "When you have brought the people out of Egypt,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.740]   "you," plural, all of you,
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.580]   "will worship God on this mountain."
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.740]   I love God's reply to Moses' cry of inadequacy.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.860]   Who am I?
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.020]   God goes, "It doesn't matter who you are.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.320]   "What matters is who I am.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.920]   "And what matters is that I'm gonna be with you.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.280]   "And if I've chosen to be with you,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.700]   "who can be against you?"
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   Some of you, that's a word in season in this room right now,
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.500]   watching online right now.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.640]   You're not adequate, but that's okay
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.300]   'cause God is more than sufficient and God is with you.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.420]   And when God is with us, who can be against us?
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.060]   And God says, "There'll be a sign to you
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.360]   "that I was with you,
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.860]   "a sign that you can take to the bank
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.920]   "that I journeyed with you.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.280]   "And the sign is this.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.780]   "When you gather around this mountain,
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.100]   "you will worship me."
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.180]   I love this idea.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.020]   God is basically saying,
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.420]   "You wanna know what the fruit of Exodus is?
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.180]   "You wanna know what the fruit of freedom is?
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.900]   "It's worship.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.860]   "When my people are set free,
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.000]   "they can't help but worship me."
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.300]   And he says, "This is a sign
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.420]   "that despite what might be happening in your life,
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.780]   "you will take it as truth,
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.800]   "as a joy, as a privilege to worship me,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.300]   "that your circumstances will not define
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.480]   "whether you praise or not.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.020]   "When I have delivered you, you will worship."
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:30.140]   There's a church in the center of Cairo
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.360]   that dates back to the fourth century.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.880]   It's one of the oldest churches that there is in Egypt.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.980]   And this church, despite an incredibly hostile environment
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.060]   since the fourth century,
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.720]   continues to gather to worship today.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.060]   Because they have understood
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.180]   that what God has done through the Exodus
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.000]   has purchased a heavy price
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.260]   for them to have the freedom to declare the praises of God,
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.220]   even in a very strongly Islamic culture.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.860]   And their ability to worship,
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.580]   I find incredibly inspiring and deeply challenging.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.560]   And I want you to experience a little bit of that.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.360]   I want you to feel a little bit of that today.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.720]   And so I wanna take you to this particular church now.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.080]   I wanna show you a little bit more of them.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.040]   They're a very different church to us.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.920]   They have icons and rituals.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.320]   They're a Greek Orthodox church,
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.560]   very different to how we might worship here.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.600]   And yet in their worship,
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.320]   we can see something that perhaps might help
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.160]   to facilitate ours.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.400]   Let's go to Egypt.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.400]   (wind blowing)
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:43.300]   We've come today to the busy, bustling center of Cairo City
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.300]   to actually explore perhaps what is the most central part
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.460]   of the Exodus story itself.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.300]   Behind me right here is the Hanging Church of Cairo.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.860]   It's a fourth century Coptic Orthodox church,
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.220]   making this perhaps the oldest worshiping community
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.940]   in Egypt today.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.660]   This church truly has a remarkable story
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.460]   and I can't wait to show you around.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:09.100]   The Hanging Church is named for its location
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.260]   above the gatehouse of an ancient Babylon fortress
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.500]   where its nave is actually suspended without trusts
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.420]   over the passage of the fortress,
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.700]   giving the structure the impression
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.820]   that it's hanging in the air.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.940]   The church itself is approached by 29 steps,
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.900]   leading early travelers to Cairo
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.340]   to dub it the Staircase Church.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.700]   The entrance from the street is through iron gates
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.860]   under a pointed stone arch.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.100]   The 19th century facade with twin bell towers
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.580]   is then seen beyond a narrow courtyard
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.900]   decorated with modern biblical art.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.080]   Up the steps and through the entrance is the main chapel,
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.580]   the entrance of which leads to an outer porch
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.340]   that dates back to the 11th century.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.980]   But as beautiful as the structure of the church is,
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.640]   its real power rests in the stories that are found within it.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.900]   One such story is found right here
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.140]   along the main wall of the church itself.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.280]   This inscription here is in Arabic
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.500]   so that anybody walking here could read it.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.540]   And it's actually a summary of that moment
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.020]   where Jesus meets the woman at the well
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.740]   and tells her that there is a water she could drink
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.660]   that will never run out.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.060]   And here's the great thing.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.020]   The church, right below that inscription,
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.620]   has created two taps.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.220]   Now, they're boarded up here,
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.020]   but in centuries before, these two taps
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.380]   would provide sanitized running water
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.300]   to the poor people of Cairo.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.260]   This was the church's social justice outreach.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.660]   And the people would come here,
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.300]   they would take the clean, sanitized water,
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.980]   and at the same time read about a God
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.140]   who can provide water that would never run out.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.980]   I mean, this is the gospel at work.
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.580]   This is the word and works side by side.
[00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:55.120]   One of the fascinating things about the Coptic church
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.740]   is their deep connection to Christianity's Jewish roots.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.740]   In fact, a great example of that is found
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.500]   right here at the entrance to this particular church.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.260]   I want you to see something really cool here.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.120]   You'll notice that the Star of David
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.200]   is worked into the wood of the door
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.620]   right here at the entrance.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.260]   And this has significant theological meaning.
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.620]   What the Coptics are saying is,
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.860]   before you even go inside the church to worship Jesus,
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.140]   you have to first enter through the doorway
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.500]   of the Old Testament.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.320]   And when you think about us now understanding
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.920]   what Christ has done in liberating us
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.760]   out of the slavery of our sin
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.240]   and bringing us into the freedom of our promised land
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.880]   in grace and forgiveness,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.160]   well, we only can really understand the beauty of that
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.880]   when we link it to the original Exodus story
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.520]   in the Old Testament itself.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.360]   Like the Coptics, so also for us.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.120]   We understand Jesus through the doorway
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.160]   of the Old Testament.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.680]   The storytelling doesn't stop at the doorway.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.140]   Right inside the main entrance
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.940]   is a beautiful, spacious courtyard
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.780]   leading to the steps that take worshippers
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.100]   to the main chapel.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.340]   The courtyard is covered in modern biblical art
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.340]   telling stories of various Old Testament
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.620]   and New Testament events,
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.840]   specifically as they relate to Egypt.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.620]   You know, just being here and being surrounded
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.780]   by all these mosaics and this beautiful iconography,
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.500]   I mean, you really get the sense
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.420]   of how important storytelling and remembering is
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.860]   to the Coptic practice of worship.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.780]   And to find out a little bit more about that,
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.260]   I thought it would be great to sit down
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.540]   with one of the priests here,
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.660]   actually the priest that leads the morning prayers,
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.980]   and talk with them a little bit more
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.020]   about how central all of this beautiful art is
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.860]   to the way they practice their faith.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:48.460]   Father Samuel, we're so grateful
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.900]   that you would host us in your beautiful church
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.700]   and show us a little bit about the Coptic worship.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.900]   Maybe you could tell me a little bit
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.060]   about some of the icons that are here.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.060]   Yes, it was a pleasure.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:58.900]   Thank you.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.740]   Thank you.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:03.780]   This church is the name of the Virgin Mary
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.060]   and Saint Demian.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.140]   It's called the Hanging Church.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.580]   Why we call it the Hanging Church?
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.780]   Because it was built above the two fortress,
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.100]   Roman fortress.
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.140]   The ancient people put palm tree above the fortress
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.740]   and built the church above the fortress
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.660]   without any foundation.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.700]   It used palm tree and the stones
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.380]   as a pavilion to this church.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.660]   Because it's called the Hanging Church.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.660]   As we see, the shape of the roof is made by wood
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.180]   because the heavy in the engineering style.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.260]   Right, right, right, right.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.380]   This church was built as a basilican style.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.180]   It's famous for columns and arches.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.700]   And as we see, it's built as Noah's Ark.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.700]   As Noah's Ark?
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.540]   Yes.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.460]   Oh, I didn't, I can see that with the way the wood,
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.300]   the roof is on the wall.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.580]   Yes, and the windows.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:12.180]   As we see, if you see the column,
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.340]   we can found eight columns.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.180]   Okay.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:21.180]   Which represent the eight persons who was in Noah's Ark.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.500]   Noah, his wife, his three sons, and his wife.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.340]   Yes.
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.180]   Yes.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:27.020]   Oh, wow, okay.
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.340]   And why is Noah's Ark so important?
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:33.460]   Yes, because the Noah's Ark is symbol of salvation.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.820]   And the church is a symbol of,
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.820]   is a salvation for people in the church.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.300]   And I know for the Coptic church,
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.820]   the emphasis of salvation is very important.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:46.660]   Yes.
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.420]   Are there other elements here that show us that?
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.460]   Yes.
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.140]   This icon says, symbol of the heaven.
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.860]   We can found Jesus Christ in the middle,
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.300]   and the Virgin Mary, and St. John's Baptism,
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   and Archangel Gabriel, and Archangel Michael,
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.820]   and St. Peter, St. Paul.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.660]   Wow.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.500]   Yes.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.740]   And I understand Paul is very central,
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.980]   and Peter is also very central to the Coptic church.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.820]   Yes.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.820]   Right, right, right, right.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.180]   Okay, very interesting.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.180]   This icon says, made of three items,
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.460]   ivory, ebony, and ebonos.
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.300]   Okay.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.500]   Collected together without any glue, as a bezel.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.420]   Oh, wow.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.260]   Yes, we can see.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.260]   And those three elements,
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.860]   do they represent like a trinity?
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.980]   Yes, yes.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:34.860]   Okay, maybe show me again.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.180]   As you see, this is ivory.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.900]   This is ebony, and cedars.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:41.740]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.500]   Yes, it is collected together as a puzzle.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.820]   Gathered together as a puzzle.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.660]   As a puzzle?
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.500]   Yes.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:49.820]   Oh, it moves.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.380]   Oh, no way!
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.580]   We can see the ancient, this icon says,
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.700]   come back to the 11th century.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.540]   Right.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.900]   We can see the worker, how made the shape,
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.660]   is in ivory, without any machines,
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.140]   without any laser cut.
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.340]   Handmade.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.740]   Yes, and the collected ivory was ebony
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.300]   with cedars together.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.340]   Now, I know that there is a famous staircase here.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.180]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.060]   Can you explain to me the staircase?
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.740]   Maybe take me there and show me.
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.940]   Okay, yes, okay.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.780]   We can found here, it's two doors.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.620]   Oh, the doors.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.940]   I didn't notice the doors before.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.780]   Yes.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.620]   Okay, okay.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.260]   This is doors, when it's open,
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:36.180]   we found the two way to escape from this church.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.580]   It's used in the ancient time.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.420]   Okay.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.820]   Because if anyone come to the church to kill people,
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.300]   you have two way.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.820]   You have stay in the church to be a martyrs,
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.260]   like our martyrs here.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.100]   Yes.
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.180]   Or to escape from this way,
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.940]   to go a new generation in Christianity.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.100]   Of course, both is important.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.940]   Yes.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.860]   So people would actually, they would be worshipping here.
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.700]   Yes.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.740]   Maybe if some danger comes in,
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.500]   the doors would open and they would go and escape that way.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.340]   Yes.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.180]   Wow.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.100]   From here, you can see.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.740]   You can.
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.580]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.340]   Amazing.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.820]   Yes, we have two escape way.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.220]   This is way to the people,
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.980]   and this escape way to a small room.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.980]   Okay.
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.260]   Yes, from here.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.420]   Oh, wow.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.900]   From the stairs to a small room.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.820]   If we didn't finish the service,
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.140]   the priest and one of the deacons
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:50.260]   take communion and go in this church
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:56.020]   and close the door and continue the liturgy,
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.860]   continue the service.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.020]   Let me understand this,
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.820]   'cause I think this is very beautiful.
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.420]   So if people are having a service here,
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.980]   and somebody comes in in the old days,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.980]   and it's dangerous, they would flee for their lives,
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.460]   but you would then go and still finish the service.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.340]   Yes, yes.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.820]   That's how important the worship is.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:18.660]   Yes.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.500]   To keep the worship going.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.340]   Yes.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.940]   Wow, that is a powerful story.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.900]   Thank you so much.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:27.500]   I mean, this for me is just so powerful
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.060]   to see the commitment to worship in Egypt
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.700]   for so many centuries.
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.740]   Yes, it's just an amazing thing.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.860]   So why is all of this important?
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.860]   I mean, why have we come to this church today
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.780]   and understood its iconography and art
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.780]   and had examples of the worship here?
[00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.060]   Well, when God first appears to Moses
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.780]   at the burning bush in Exodus chapter three,
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:54.500]   he tells Moses the reason for the Exodus in the first place.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.940]   He tells him why he's gonna send them back to Pharaoh
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.940]   to demand for the people to be let go
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.740]   and why he wants them to move from slavery to freedom.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.420]   And it's for one simple reason,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.660]   and that is to worship.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.780]   God desires to deliver his people
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.900]   so they would be free to worship him.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.220]   And that's why this church matters
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.420]   because all the people that gather here today
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.660]   in central Cairo are proof
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.740]   that the fruit of the Exodus is still ongoing.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.100]   It's proof that people can still gather
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.180]   to be free to worship Jesus today.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.020]   And that should be an encouragement to all of us.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.900]   When you think about you and your freedom of worship,
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.300]   you should never take that freedom for granted.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.340]   People have sacrificed and paid the price
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.020]   for thousands of years.
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.460]   And God is not just the God of the original Exodus.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.740]   He is also the God of your Exodus too.
[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.820]   And the challenge for you is to ask yourself this,
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.060]   are you truly free to worship?
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.620]   And are you doing it in your everyday life?
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.780]   Doing that will honor God
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.020]   and will honor the Exodus itself.
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.540]   (congregation applauding)
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:07.100]   This question of whether we're truly free to worship,
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.900]   I think is a question that is quite relevant
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.540]   for our church here in Hong Kong in this time.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.380]   Perhaps it's a relevant question for us
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.980]   as we think about our future here in this city.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.220]   And the story of the Hanging Church inspires me deeply
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.780]   'cause I want you to see the focus
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.420]   that they have at that church.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.780]   Their focus is not on the political system
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.740]   and the political situation that they're in,
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.220]   although that's a very tricky situation in Egypt.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.340]   Their focus isn't on the cultural realities
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.740]   of being a minority Christian community
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.940]   in a majority Islamic culture.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.900]   Their focus is not even on whether somebody
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.700]   might come into that building with a bomb
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.300]   and try to kill people in their services.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.480]   Their focus is on God and worshiping Him.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:55.300]   So much so that if somebody does come in to bomb them,
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.260]   the priest will not flee with everybody,
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.180]   but will take some icon and some communion,
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.740]   will go down into that passageway and finish the service
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.700]   before he would look after his own life.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.060]   I love it in the film where,
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.340]   when Father Samuel said that to me,
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.780]   I was like, kinda thought like he was sort of half joking.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.820]   I'm like, "Really, really?"
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.460]   And he's like, "Yes, yes, of course."
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.020]   Almost like, "Would you not do that?"
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.980]   And I'm like, "No."
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.220]   I would run really fast and throw Vine people behind me.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.020]   No, just kidding, I wouldn't do that.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:36.100]   But what a deep challenge, isn't it?
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.980]   Like we worry, and maybe rightly so,
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.460]   what's our freedoms gonna be like in Hong Kong to worship?
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.980]   We are so free to worship.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.820]   We do not have things on the bottom of our floors
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.700]   that we need to escape down if somebody comes in to kill us.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.900]   Are you with me, church?
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.580]   And they are so focused on worship
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.500]   because they've come to understand the beauty of the Exodus
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.620]   that God sets us free so we can worship,
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.220]   sets us free so that we might be a sign
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.220]   to the world of that freedom.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.340]   I mean, this church in the center of Cairo today,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.060]   surrounded by all that it's surrounded by,
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.740]   is a sign that the Exodus actually happened.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.700]   And I love how God says it here.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.460]   He says, "This will be a sign to you.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.780]   You will gather to worship."
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.380]   This is always what worship is.
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.980]   It is a sign to a tired and weary world that God is true,
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:27.300]   His promises are right, and He delivers His people.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.700]   And I love how God says here,
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.100]   "It'll be a sign to you after you come out of Egypt."
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.340]   I love this because so often when God calls us to things,
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.940]   we wanna sign today.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.940]   Give me a sign first, and then I'll do what you asked me to.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.940]   Give me a sign, Lord.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.380]   We're like, "Oh, I think God's calling this."
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.700]   God, just confirm it with a sign.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.100]   And God says to Moses, "I'll give you a sign,
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.300]   but it will come at the end.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.780]   I'll give you a sign after you've been obedient
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.700]   and trustful and faithful.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.900]   And you will gather around this mountain
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:56.740]   and it'll be a sign.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:57.580]   And from that point forward,
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.860]   it'll be a sign for all centuries and centuries
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.860]   and centuries of the power that there is
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.660]   for a God to deliver His people.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.580]   The sign will come at the end to tell you
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.340]   that I was with you the whole way."
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.460]   The filming, I'm gonna finish with a story.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.580]   I am finishing.
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.340]   I'm gonna finish with a story.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.300]   The day that we filmed in the hanging church
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.140]   was day seven of 23 days of filming in Egypt.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.060]   And it was quite easily the hardest day of filming for me.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.140]   Not because it was technically difficult,
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.340]   but because of how I was feeling inside.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.940]   We were six days in or seven days in,
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.820]   and I have to say it was such a battle
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.340]   to even get to Egypt.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.620]   Four years of canceled visas,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.940]   of not getting security clearances,
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.380]   of not knowing whether the company we were working with
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.100]   in Egypt was gonna come through for us.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.660]   Four years of ups and downs.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.900]   And every step of the way, pushing and pressing on
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.460]   and trying to do it and wondering, what are we doing?
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.900]   Is this really gonna happen for us or whatever?
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.980]   And then we finally get to Egypt and we start filming.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.620]   And the filming is going relatively well,
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.260]   but self-doubt and insecurity is kind of really there for me.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.460]   And I'm wrestling with this reality of,
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.460]   have I just tried to make this work in my own effort?
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.220]   Like, is God really in this?
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.460]   I mean, is this really gonna happen?
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.780]   Is this gonna go through?
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.340]   Like, is this gonna be a blessing
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.300]   to the church in Hong Kong?
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.140]   Is this actually gonna help anyone?
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.820]   And the day before we filmed at the hanging church,
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.660]   one of our crew members from the UK
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.820]   got a phone call from his wife.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.260]   His wife was pregnant and she was supposed to give birth
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.100]   seven weeks after the end of filming.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.340]   But she calls him and says, "My waters are just broken
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.860]   "and I'm heading to the hospital."
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.460]   So he, understandably, jumps on a plane that day
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.580]   and flies back to the UK and he manages to get there
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.420]   in time for the birth, amazing thing.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.020]   But we were a person down on our shoot as well.
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.500]   And that was frustrating me as well.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.180]   Like, oh God, why have we come all this way?
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.780]   And now like all this stuff is happening
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.980]   and why did that person come?
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:46.820]   God, what are you up to?
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.980]   How you even end this?
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.020]   Well, at the end of the filming with Father Samuel,
[00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.460]   I pretended like I was happy.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.300]   (laughs)
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.740]   "Oh, Father Samuel, oh."
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.820]   He's such a nice guy, right?
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.980]   Like, it's like, how can you not like be nice around him?
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.940]   But inside I was like, ah, my attitude was really bad.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.860]   And at the end of it, after we had finished filming,
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.460]   he said, "Andrew, I'd like you to come to my office.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.180]   "I want to share Egyptian tea with you.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:11.580]   "But you can't bring your cameras
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.580]   "'cause it's a sacred place."
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.580]   And I'm like, well, internally I was like,
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.700]   well, if I can't take my cameras,
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.940]   what's the point in going?
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.620]   (audience laughs)
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.860]   Are you with me, church?
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.740]   Don't be with me, don't be with me.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.980]   (audience laughs)
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.620]   But I, and so I'm like having this bad attitude.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.460]   I'm like, I'm not sure.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.500]   And we had more filming to do in other places that day.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.540]   So I was looking at my watch, looking at the schedule.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.260]   And I remember like our Egyptian crew,
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.060]   one of the Egyptian guys that we had hired
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.380]   to help us with all the locations,
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.260]   he took me aside into a private place.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.980]   It's just like, you know, when Jesus was bad
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.020]   and the disciples had to take Jesus to the side,
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.940]   you know, and so.
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.100]   So he takes me to the side and he goes,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.260]   "Andrew, you need to understand
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.740]   "when an Egyptian priest invites you for a tea,
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.220]   "you do not say no, it's offensive if you say no."
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.660]   So I'm like, are you telling me I have to do this?
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.300]   He's like, "You have to do this."
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.340]   So I'm like, okay, come on, let's go.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.740]   Okay, I don't even like Egyptian tea, but that's fine.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.260]   (audience laughs)
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.540]   I'll go.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.420]   So myself on my own, no cameras, no nothing.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.700]   We go into his room and we sit down.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.940]   And Father Sam was such a nice guy.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.020]   He sits me down in a chair next to his desk.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.700]   He's got this big, massive, ornate desk.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.540]   I sit down, there's a Bible opened on his desk.
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.300]   There's a Bible opened on my desk, by the way,
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.620]   most of the time.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.780]   There's a big Bible opened on his desk.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.220]   And on top of the Bible is an icon, one of the icons.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.500]   It's a wooden cross.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.380]   And immediately my eyes are drawn to this cross.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:33.220]   And I'm trying to think,
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.740]   what am I gonna talk about with Father Samuel?
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.300]   So I'm like, oh, nice cross.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.220]   Can I have a look at the cross?
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.100]   So Father Samuel takes the cross off his Bible.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.540]   He passes it over to me and I look at it.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.140]   Now, it's a cross where there are two images on both sides.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.340]   On one image, on one side, it's the ascension of Jesus,
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.860]   Jesus floating up into heaven.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.420]   On the other side, it's Jesus on the cross,
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.620]   bleeding on the cross.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.660]   It was quite gruesome.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.860]   It was kind of one of these icons
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.740]   where you can turn it like this.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.180]   But what struck me as soon as I saw it
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.940]   was that on the cross at the top and the bottom
[00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.860]   were massive pieces of grapes, pitches of grapes,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.860]   and a little vine that was connected to the grapes.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.340]   And I looked at this cross and I said to him,
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.180]   what does this mean?
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.020]   What is this cross?
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.060]   What does it mean?
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.340]   And he said, oh, this was made by the nuns in our nunnery,
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.460]   just by the side of the church.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.180]   And this is the cross that says,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.460]   I am the vine and you are the branches.
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.980]   And I started to like well up with tears.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.060]   'Cause I mean, this guy didn't know all of the emotions
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.780]   that were going around in my heart that day.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.180]   But God knew.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.420]   And God had provided a sign.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.700]   Not at the start, not even in the middle,
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.060]   not even at the beginning of year four.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.900]   But when I had finally gone to Egypt,
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.220]   we'd finally started recording and there it was,
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.060]   I was with you the whole time.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.460]   And that just released worship.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.100]   It just released gratitude and thankfulness
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.460]   that my God was with me the whole time,
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.780]   even though so often I felt like he was distant.
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.260]   And I was literally like welling up with tears.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.460]   And I think Father Samuel thought
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.460]   that maybe the icon was having an effect on me or something.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:13.580]   And he said, would you like to keep it?
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.820]   And so this is now one of my favorite possessions.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.980]   Here it is, this is it.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.540]   You can see it up here, you can see a big picture of it.
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.700]   Look at that, there's that side
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.340]   and then there's the not so nice side
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.020]   where he's bleeding and stuff.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:32.020]   But can you see the grapes, top, top and bottom?
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.140]   You can have a look at this afterwards
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.500]   if you'd like to look at this.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.380]   It's one of my, honestly, one of my great,
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.980]   I'm gonna place it on my Bible, one of my great treasures.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.940]   It released me to worship.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.460]   And I want you to know that God has a call on your life
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.180]   that you're not adequate for.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.460]   And if you're part of the church here in Hong Kong right now,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.420]   there's an important call on your life.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.260]   And that is to be someone who can testify
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:57.500]   and be a sign to the world that God's promises are true,
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.540]   that he can bring freedom,
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.460]   and that he can truly set us free by his grace.
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.940]   And as we sing, as we go about our workplace,
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.680]   as we meet God in various areas of our lives,
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   may we constantly be a symbol of the freedom of God.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.620]   Amen.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.660]   I wonder whether you'd astound me, I wanna pray for us,
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.560]   and I wanna release us into a moment of worship together.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:26.020]   I invite you just to open your hands.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.140]   Lord, we come before you now,
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.120]   grateful for the example of the Hanging Church in Cairo,
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.740]   for Father Samuel and the other priests,
[00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.900]   for the worshipers in that community there.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.700]   Father, as we're here in Hong Kong
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.860]   and we have some questions
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.900]   about our religious freedoms in our city,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.700]   and as those questions perhaps are over us at this time,
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.820]   and we're wondering what the future might hold,
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:49.860]   Father, thank you for this reminder
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.620]   that our focus isn't on those things.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.260]   Our focus is on you,
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.940]   and of the incredible privilege we have right now
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.580]   to worship you, to be free to gather in this room,
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.160]   to open our hearts and to declare with our voices,
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.220]   to be a sign in our city that your promises are true.
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.460]   Father, I pray for anyone in this room
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.240]   that feels inadequate for the call of God on their lives.
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.180]   I pray that, Lord, you would fill them today
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.780]   with your spirit again and tell them I am with you,
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:22.060]   that I am sufficient for your inadequacy.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.000]   Lord, I pray that you would release worship in this place
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.500]   as we recognize that our freedom from sin
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.980]   releases us to a place of gratitude,
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.980]   to a place of offering our hearts to you
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.140]   and our worship to you.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.780]   And Lord, as we worship you now, come Holy Spirit.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.260]   On Pentecost Sunday, they gathered in that room,
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.060]   your spirit fell, and they worshipped you.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.600]   They worshipped you in multiple tongues and languages
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.320]   so that everybody who didn't know you in their city
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.520]   could come to know Jesus.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.620]   That was a sign of the power of the freedom of worship
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.580]   led by the spirit.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.140]   And Lord, as we worship you now,
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.380]   would you move in the spirit,
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.180]   and with all the cultures that are represented in this room,
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.980]   may we be your hands and feet
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.020]   to a tired and weary Hong Kong.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.220]   Can we bring the hope of the gospel in this time.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.020]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
