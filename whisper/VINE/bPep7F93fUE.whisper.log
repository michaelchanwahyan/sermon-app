[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   When I was a teenager, I used to skate.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.560]   So, I was skateboarding.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.740]   Now, that didn't last that long, because I kept falling,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.200]   especially when I started trying to do, like, half pipes,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.300]   quarter pipes, that sort of thing,
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.900]   and I ended up having a blue spot that was like,
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.100]   you know, like a little half a pizza on my side,
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.760]   and I decided, maybe this is not what I'm meant to do.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.040]   But while I was still into street skating and all of that,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.800]   I needed to buy a part for my skateboard.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.960]   So, I went to the skate shop.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.700]   They had the part that I needed.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.040]   I went to pay with my 10 German marks.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.900]   So, this also shows that this was a long time ago,
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.900]   and the cashier gave me a change for 100 German marks.
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.540]   Now, let me put this in Hong Kong equivalents.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.700]   So, I gave 100 Hong Kong dollars
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.440]   and was expecting about 50 Hong Kong dollars back,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.860]   and the cashier thought that I gave him 1,000 Hong Kong dollars
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.200]   and gave me 950 Hong Kong dollars back.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200]   So, I took the money.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.060]   I was like, "This is amazing.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.340]   The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.740]   Praise God."
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.360]   You don't believe me, right?
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.500]   Or maybe. No.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.340]   That's not what I did, but I was tempted to do it.
[00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.300]   I wanted to keep the money.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.960]   So, this was that much money at that time.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.240]   So, you can imagine, actually, by now,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.340]   it probably doubled the amount of that money
[00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940]   in terms of what you can purchase with that.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.340]   And so, we all, you know, at one point or another,
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.140]   in different ways, for me as a teenager,
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.000]   it was a temptation to keep it and keep my mouth shut
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.800]   and take the money, but we all face temptations.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.960]   And they're different for different people.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   It's easy to look at somebody else and say,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.300]   "Oh, you're tempted with the money."
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.800]   Then, "Oh," you know, like, that's --
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.900]   Why would you be tempted with that?
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.100]   That doesn't impact me whatsoever.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.400]   But we all have areas where we actually do struggle
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.140]   with our sinful nature, where we want to do things
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.340]   that we know are not right.
[00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.460]   We know they're not good,
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.560]   but we find ourselves sometimes doing them anyhow.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.060]   And so, for some of us, maybe that has to do with money.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.060]   Maybe it has to do with business,
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.360]   getting ahead in your business,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.400]   cutting corners, not paying taxes.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.200]   For others, maybe it has to do with relationships.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.600]   Maybe we have an affair.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.360]   Maybe we have an emotional affair,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.700]   where we have emotional intimacy
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.960]   with somebody other than our spouse.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.560]   So this is something that happens quite often.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.760]   Of course, that, then, a lot of times,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.000]   does lead to a full-fledged affair, as well.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.100]   For others, it might be maybe there's drinking.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.800]   Maybe we drink alcohol,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.400]   and then we're tempted to just drink more.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.500]   Maybe it's pornography.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.200]   Maybe it is gambling.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.920]   You know, so we all have different things.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.000]   You can fill in the blank.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.660]   I think we know the type of things
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.860]   where we feel that temptation.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.100]   And this is also true for us as Christians.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.600]   We also still face these temptations.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.220]   We also sometimes have these strong urges and feelings
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.460]   coming upon ourselves,
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.500]   where we want to do the things
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.800]   that we know are not right,
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.420]   that we know are not good,
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.960]   that are destructive, a lot of times, to ourselves
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.160]   and to those whom we love.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.400]   So what I want to do with you today through this message,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000]   I want to explore with you a question.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.900]   And the question is this.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.020]   How can we be led by the Spirit
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.100]   and live lives that honor God?
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.460]   You know, how can we rely on the Holy Spirit's power
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.120]   to strengthen us, to overcome our sinful desires,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.220]   and not give in to them?
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.600]   You know, how do you do that?
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.000]   What does that look like?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.420]   So that's what we're going to explore.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.520]   We are continuing in our sermon series
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.020]   through the Book of Galatians.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.680]   Let me set the context for a passage.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.220]   So Paul, he has been proclaiming the gospel.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.320]   And there's been a group of agitators,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.280]   or we've called them rival missionaries,
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.080]   who came in after him
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.480]   and who challenged the gospel that he preached.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.140]   Now, one of the things that they challenged about the gospel
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.600]   is that they said it doesn't lead to holy living.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.900]   It doesn't lead to true righteousness.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.160]   How can a gospel where we're forgiven by grace,
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.240]   you know, through faith, end up leading to a holy life?
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.440]   Doesn't that just give permission to sin?
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.340]   Because we know God's going to show us grace
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.100]   and forgiveness anyhow.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.560]   So they're attacking his gospel
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   and the ethics of that gospel.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.440]   You know, what does that lead to?
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.340]   And that's why they're emphasizing the observing
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.760]   of the Mosaic Law and all the rules and do's and don'ts
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.100]   and trying to earn and be righteous through that.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.700]   But here in our passage today, as we're going to see,
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.940]   Paul shows us that it is the Spirit of God within us
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.740]   who brings about the true righteous life
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.600]   and true holiness
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.500]   and who turns us and transforms us into people
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.400]   who can say no to our sinful nature, to our temptations,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.800]   and be people who reflect his character.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.000]   So let me turn with you to Galatians 5,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.400]   and starting in verse 16, it says this.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.500]   "So I say, live by the Spirit,
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.160]   and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.900]   For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.200]   and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.400]   They are in conflict with each other
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.060]   so that you are not to do whatever you want.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.320]   But if you are led by the Spirit,
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.420]   you are not under the law.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.200]   The acts of the flesh are obvious.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.600]   Sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.960]   idolatry and witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.320]   fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   and envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.400]   I warn you, as I did before,
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.960]   that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.560]   But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance"
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.660]   also translated as patience,
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.160]   "kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.420]   against such thing there is no law.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.600]   Those who belong to Christ Jesus
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.920]   have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.720]   Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.900]   Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other."
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.360]   So what Paul does here, he holds up this picture before the Galatians.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.960]   He holds up what's known as a vice list,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.360]   where it lists all the acts of the flesh.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.560]   And it's just an example, so it doesn't mean that's it.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.800]   There's more stuff to it,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.160]   but it's just probably specifically also targeted at the Galatians.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.760]   Maybe that's some of the things he knows what's going on.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.160]   And then the other one is he lists the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.960]   the holiness, the righteousness, the character of Jesus
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.060]   that the Holy Spirit produced in our lives.
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.060]   So he holds that up to the Galatian Christians.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.360]   And I want to look with you at both of them.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.260]   So we're going to start with the acts of the flesh.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.760]   But before I unpack that more,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.060]   I actually want to talk about the word "flesh."
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.060]   Now, "flesh" for us, you know, just means, in English, means this.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.560]   And that also means this in God's Word and in the Bible.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.360]   It also means human body.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.960]   But it also means our fallen, sinful human nature.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.060]   So a lot of times when Paul talks about the flesh,
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.560]   that's what he's referring to, our fallen, sinful human nature,
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.660]   our inclination to do things that are not right and that don't please God.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.460]   And so that's what "sarx" or "flesh," what that Greek word means.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.160]   But let's look at this list that Paul gives us.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.560]   So I'm going to read it again. It's verse 19.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.760]   He says, "The acts of the flesh are obvious.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.560]   Sexual morality, impurity, debauchery,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.660]   idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.260]   selfish ambition, dissension, faction, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like."
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.160]   So he just lays it all out there.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.460]   And there's 15 things that he lists.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.560]   And we can break those down into, like, three general categories.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.060]   So let me share those categories with you.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.860]   The first one is disunity.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.960]   The second one is personal.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.460]   And the third one is spiritual boundary crossing.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.560]   So I want to unpack that a little bit.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.760]   So when it talks about disunity, you know, these vices being in there,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.460]   it means things like hatred, discord, jealousy, and on.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.660]   And basically, that's the temptation, we're tempted within us to be,
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.760]   to bring separation between us and people.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.460]   It's like actions that break down relationships
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.760]   because we cannot help to, you know, pursue our selfish things,
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.860]   but actually it's hurtful to other people.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.560]   Like, that would be me when I was, if I would have taken the money from the cashier,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.260]   then in the evening, you would have to count, "Why is all this money missing?"
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.460]   You know, would have raised some questions.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.060]   So my selfishness would have impacted, you know, him.
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.560]   And so what these acts of the flesh do, they break down relationships.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.360]   That's what sin does.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   It breaks down relationships between us and other people.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.860]   And I think we can see that even if we just follow politics, right, around the world,
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.560]   whether the US election or, we can see there's a lot of acting in the flesh
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.960]   where there's just a breakdown of relationship
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.160]   and of how people relate to each other in that.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.060]   So that's the first one, the temptations of the flesh,
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.360]   they lead us to this unity and to breakdown of relationship.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.160]   The second one is personal, where the flesh tempts us to just say to ourselves,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.560]   "Oh, it's okay, just indulge a little bit more in that.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.760]   It's okay to drink a little bit more of that wine,
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.060]   even though you already had a bottle and a half.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.560]   You know, just drink a little bit more.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.060]   You know, it's okay to watch pornography.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.060]   You know, you deserve it.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.260]   Just relax and enjoy."
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.060]   So that's how the flesh tempts us.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.060]   And so we personally indulge in things.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.760]   And initially, those things feel good.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.760]   Otherwise, we wouldn't do it.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   We're not stupid, right?
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.960]   We do things because initially they feel good.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.660]   They do give pleasure, some pleasure.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.460]   But in the end, they are also destructive to ourselves.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.060]   They hurt ourselves.
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.860]   And a lot of times, they also end up hurting other people as well.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:03.260]   And so that's a personal, you know, acts of the flesh that have a personal impact.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.660]   And then the final one is spiritual boundary crossing.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.060]   So that has to do with witchcraft, with idolatry.
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.660]   What that means is, like, you're just, you're a Christian,
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:23.360]   but there is a temptation that you believe maybe God cannot fully deliver.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.960]   So I need to hedge my bets.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.360]   So I'm not just going to trust God,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.860]   but I'm also going to go to the fortune teller about my love life.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.060]   And I'm going to ask him to, you know, help me and give me some insights
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:40.260]   so I can receive whoever it is that I'm meant to be with.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.660]   Or it might be, like, maybe you do some sort of ritual
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:46.160]   so that more cash comes flowing in, you know,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.560]   that we can receive, you know, all the blessings and everything, whatever.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.960]   And you guys know, some of you know this even better than me,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.660]   you know, all these things.
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.060]   But basically, all of this is rooted in a lack of trust in God,
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.060]   that God truly loves you, that he can truly provide for you,
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.560]   that he will truly, will be faithful to you.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.660]   I've been saying that he will truly come through for you.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.660]   And so we do these other things on the side.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.260]   But the problem is that the source of these things is evil.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.660]   It's Satan. It's demonic.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.560]   And as Christians, we should not be crossing this boundary.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   But sometimes we do.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.960]   But whenever we do, a lot of times evil leads to fear in our lives
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.660]   and just, we give evil a foothold in our lives.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.760]   And so we don't want to do that.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.860]   So those are the acts of the flesh.
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.860]   And so Paul is holding us up before the Galatians.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.960]   And we can see that this represents the power of the flesh
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.560]   to bring out the worst in our lives.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.660]   You know, just really brings destruction in our personal lives and to others as well.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.560]   So that's the first thing.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.360]   But then Paul also holds up the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.160]   And so let's look at those in verse 22 and 23.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.660]   It says this, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.360]   forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.560]   Against such things there is no law."
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   So Paul holds up the ninefold fruit.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.060]   And I want to briefly talk about those.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.560]   At some point in time, maybe we'll do a sermon series on that.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.660]   That would be fun.
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.560]   No guarantees.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.260]   But as I was looking at this, I was like, "Oh, that would be interesting to unpack all of those."
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260]   But let me just briefly touch on each of them.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.860]   So love is not some sentimental feeling, you know, that the Spirit produces in us,
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:46.260]   but it's actually the self-giving, sacrificial love towards others that looks like Jesus
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.960]   because we care about the welfare, the flourishing, and the thriving of others.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.560]   So it's a self-giving love.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.160]   So that's the fruit of love.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.860]   That's the Spirit of God working in us.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.560]   The second one is joy.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.860]   Joy is not dependent on our circumstances.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.060]   It's not happiness that if our circumstances are good, we're happy.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.860]   If they're bad, we're not.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.060]   Joy depends on who God is.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.160]   And we can have joy and experience joy even in painful moments in our lives
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.860]   because God is with us.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.860]   He's faithful.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.860]   He loves us.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.860]   We can know His promises.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.860]   We can know His presence even in the midst of a very difficult experience.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.960]   And the Holy Spirit can give us joy in Him.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.160]   And then peace.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.860]   We have peace with God
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.060]   because of what Jesus has done.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.860]   There is a broken relationship between us and God,
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.260]   but because of His sacrifice on the cross,
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.360]   He has brought us in a relationship with God.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.160]   And so now we have peace with God,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.460]   whereas before when we don't know Jesus, we actually had enmity with God.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.460]   But then it's not only that.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.160]   We also have the peace of God
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.960]   where God gives us peace that He is sovereign.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.160]   Regardless of what's going on in our lives,
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.760]   we can trust in Him because He's sovereign.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.860]   He will bring us through.
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.260]   He will see us through.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:09.760]   And so we can also have peace in the midst of very difficult circumstances.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.860]   Say, "I'm going to trust God because He's for me.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.160]   He's not against me."
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.660]   We're talking about earlier in worship.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.260]   And so, and of course, it also has to do with being,
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.360]   that we become peacemakers as well,
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.160]   where we bring the peace of God to others
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.560]   and we work towards the peace that God wants to bring.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.960]   Then there's patience or forbearance.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.560]   I actually like the translation "patience" more.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.060]   So we talked about that a few Sundays ago
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:45.360]   where it was that Paul was being patient with the Galatians
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.560]   who were hating on him.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.260]   They had turned on him.
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.560]   They saw him, they used to be friends, they used to be close,
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.060]   and then they saw him as an enemy.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.960]   But Paul remained patiently working with them,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.660]   not saying, "Forget you," and walking away,
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.260]   but continuing to pour his heart out
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.360]   because he wanted to see Christ fully formed in them.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.360]   And I said in that message, I said that Paul was fighting for them,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.760]   for their well-being, for their flourishing,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.560]   while they were fighting him.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.160]   So patience means we can be long-suffering.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.260]   We can endure things and still do good despite of what's happening.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.960]   But it also means, and that's where the forbearance part comes in,
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.560]   forbearance means that we can forgive and overlook sins
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   that others commit against us.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.660]   And so that's also the fruit of the Spirit in our lives
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.260]   that we're able to be patient,
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.460]   that we're able to show forbearance to others.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.460]   Then there's kindness.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.560]   God's Word says it's His kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.760]   It's His love, His mercy and grace.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   And so He also wants to bring about that same kindness in us
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:49.060]   so we can turn around and show that to other people.
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.960]   There is goodness, which is generosity.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.260]   God is so generous.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.160]   We sometimes say when we talk about our offering,
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.060]   as the fruit of the Spirit in our lives grows,
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.860]   because God is generous, we want to be generous people,
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.060]   generous with love, generous with grace,
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.860]   generous with our time, generous with our finances.
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.260]   Because when we're generous, we reflect the character of God.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.060]   And so that is another fruit that God produces in our lives.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.560]   Then there's faithfulness.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.860]   The Holy Spirit makes us faithful people,
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.860]   faithful to other people,
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.560]   faithful to God.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.160]   Then there's gentleness.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.260]   It's a humility.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.560]   It's being humble and treating other people gently.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.360]   Also has a ring of that patience where we gently work,
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.760]   maybe to restore someone,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.460]   and we don't treat them harshly.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.160]   And then finally there is self-control.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.460]   And self-control actually enables us
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.160]   not to carry out the acts of the flesh,
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.360]   because God brings about the fruit of self-control in our lives,
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:01.660]   where we're able to say no to whatever we're being tempted with.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:07.860]   And so this is the fruit of the Spirit that Paul holds up.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.460]   So if you look at those nine fruits,
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.560]   or its fruit, ninefold fruit,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.860]   it's so hard to not use the plural.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.160]   If you look at the ninefold fruit,
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.060]   it really looks like Jesus.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.660]   It's a character of God that he wants to work out in our lives
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.060]   and bring about in our lives.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.160]   And I don't know about you,
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.460]   but having these things grow in our lives,
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.760]   wouldn't that be amazing to see them unfold more and more and more and more?
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.160]   Man, I would love that,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.460]   to look more and more like that.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.960]   I'm sure you would as well.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.760]   So Paul holds up the acts of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.160]   and he basically is asking the Galatians, "Well, look at this.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.360]   Who are you looking more like?
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.460]   What does your life look like?
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.060]   What does your community's life look like more?
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.460]   Is it one where there's fighting and where there's division
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:10.160]   and there's hatred and there's indulgence and all sorts of things?
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.660]   Or is it a community where there is sacrificial love towards one another,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.260]   where there's gentleness, there's kindness,
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.660]   there's goodness displayed in that?"
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:30.060]   And so he's challenging the Galatians to be led by the Spirit,
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.560]   to walk with the Spirit.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   Because just because we have the Holy Spirit within us
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:44.060]   doesn't mean that we always surrender and open to his work in our lives.
[00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:46.860]   Now all of this, this tension,
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.860]   and honestly, if we ourselves look at that list,
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.660]   we can probably see things on the acts of the flesh list
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.060]   in ourselves as well from time to time,
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.960]   where we know that is still part of our lives.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.560]   And so this points that there is actually a tension,
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   there's a conflict, a battle around your heart,
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.760]   around your mind, around your thoughts, around your action.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.260]   And that is true for every Christian.
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.360]   So I want to talk about that more.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.660]   So let's go to looking at that.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.560]   And we see that in Galatians 5, 16 through 18, and it says this,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.360]   "So I say, live by the Spirit,
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit,
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.260]   and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.260]   They are in conflict with each other,
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.460]   so that you are not to do whatever you want.
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.860]   But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law."
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.860]   So Paul puts the live by the Spirit
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.660]   in opposition to the gratifying the desires of the flesh.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.760]   And so it's important to recognize,
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.260]   you know, we've been talking about is that,
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.060]   because Jesus has come,
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.160]   and when we place our faith in Jesus,
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.860]   He breaks the power of sin in our lives.
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.460]   We are no longer enslaved to sin.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.760]   The victory has been won.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.460]   But it doesn't mean that there are still battles that we fight.
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.360]   And so, with the help of my wife,
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.360]   I created a chart, so I want to show you that.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.060]   And I was inspired from another chart,
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.360]   but I don't know the source of that,
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.760]   or I couldn't find that, but let's look at that.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.660]   So here you see the...
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.760]   Actually, let me go to the side here.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.360]   Well, that doesn't really help.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   It's like I need to, I need to like...
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.560]   Whoa, I need to like stand like right here, right?
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.960]   Stand in the middle. Okay, there we go.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.060]   But I can't see it.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:41.260]   Okay, so we have the life apart from Jesus.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.760]   You know, sin has power over us.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.260]   We're in chains.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.660]   We are not free.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.860]   We give in, you know, to our sinful nature,
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.460]   and we live in that sin.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.360]   And our flesh draws us away from God.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.160]   You know, so you really have this force working this way
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.360]   that it wants to separate us from God,
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.360]   and we are living in separation of God.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.260]   So that is our condition.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.660]   But then when we become Christian,
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.460]   when we have life with Jesus,
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.260]   one thing that happens is that the Holy Spirit
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.460]   comes into our hearts.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.660]   Now, biblically, the heart,
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.360]   it's most of the time in the New Testament talks about it's metaphorical.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.860]   So it's a place where decisions are made.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.060]   It's also where our spiritual life takes place,
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.360]   our doubts, our faithfulness,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.460]   and also our decisions.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.360]   Our faith happens in the heart.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.860]   And so now we find ourselves,
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.860]   yes, there are still forces that are drawing us away from God.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.260]   We still deal with the sinful flesh and the temptations of it.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.460]   But now the Holy Spirit within us,
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.060]   you know, is giving us desire for the things of God
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.060]   and helping us to pursue the things of God in our lives
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.660]   and gives us a grace and a strength and a power
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.460]   as we learn to rely on the Holy Spirit
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.760]   for God's work to unfold in our lives.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.960]   And so you do see, though, that there is tension,
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.160]   that we are being pulled in two different directions.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.860]   And that's what verse 17 talks about,
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:26.060]   that what the flesh desires is opposite to what the Spirit desires.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:31.860]   Now, one thing that is important, though, to say,
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.560]   sometimes you could get an impression
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.360]   that these are equal forces at work,
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.260]   you know, that the Holy Spirit and the flesh,
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.360]   you know, it's like a 50/50 sort of pull.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.060]   But that's not true.
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.560]   You know, the Holy Spirit is more powerful than our sinful desires.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.560]   And as we learn to rely on the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.860]   you know, He allows us to overcome,
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.560]   you know, the temptations that we face
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.360]   and to gain victory in our lives over sin.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.360]   And that is a process.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.160]   And He gives us the grace to do that.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.060]   And He will see us through in that.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.160]   He will give us victory.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.860]   And so, like, one thing that I felt very strongly
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.760]   as I'm sharing about this is
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.160]   that I think we start believing in the lie,
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.060]   you know, that we are just helpless,
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.660]   we cannot do anything else,
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.960]   we're just stuck in whatever it is going on,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   you know, that we're stuck in with our sinful actions,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.660]   with our acts of the flesh.
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.960]   But that Jesus wants to say to us,
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.860]   you know, like, "With me, we can overcome this.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.360]   I'm going to give you the strength and a grace
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.160]   to transform your life.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.860]   I'm going to give you grace and the strength
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.460]   by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.460]   to bring true transformation in your hearts,
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.860]   in your minds, in your actions."
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.860]   And so I just want to just put that very clearly out there,
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.960]   that if you are a Christian,
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.660]   you know, you, the Holy Spirit will give you victory.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.360]   Now, of course, we have a responsibility
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.760]   and we're going to look at that in a second,
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.360]   but that's just very important and very clear.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.960]   Now, not too long ago, Pastor Andrew,
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.260]   he preached a message and he said something
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.760]   that I think is relevant for us here.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.760]   He said, "If the enemy can keep you from being a Christian,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.260]   the next best thing for him to do
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.660]   is to keep you from being a mature and effective one."
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:32.060]   And so what the enemy wants to do is he wants the,
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.460]   even though we have the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.660]   but he wants us keeping being stuck
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.660]   in these patterns of sin and these sinful desires
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.360]   that were caught up in them
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.160]   and that we are then ineffective,
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.860]   you know, that we carry a lot of shame,
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.860]   that we feel, you know, all of that
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.060]   and just are not as available to him.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.860]   That's where the enemy wants us.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.360]   But Jesus has come to set us free,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.660]   has come to break the power of sin in our lives.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.060]   And we are a new creation
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.860]   and he wants you to learn to walk and to live
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.360]   in the newness that he has created in you.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.460]   And a lot of the transformation,
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.760]   God can work instantly.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.560]   Like I met a drug addict
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.460]   who told me his testimony in the US
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.760]   and when he became a Christian,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.860]   you know, the Holy Spirit broke the power of his addiction.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.060]   I mean, he was addicted to heavy drugs
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.660]   that he suddenly couldn't,
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.060]   he developed a bad taste for them.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.860]   He couldn't handle them anymore.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.060]   So he pretty much immediately stopped using.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.260]   Now that was a power of the Holy Spirit
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.960]   changing that man's life.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   Now, of course, the Holy Spirit also works
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.560]   and I think in many instances works,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.860]   in most instances, gradually.
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.660]   You know, as we continue to yield to him,
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.360]   as we continue to surrender to him,
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.460]   as we continue to come to him and pray and say,
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.760]   "Help me with this.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.660]   I struggle with this.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.760]   I feel the pull, you know, from my sinful nature.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.560]   I'm even, or I'm stuck in it."
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   But as we continue to come to him
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.460]   and offer ourselves to him
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.160]   and ask him for his grace and ask him for his strength,
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.260]   he will give us his grace,
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.260]   he will give us his strength
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:20.760]   and he will help us overcome and see us through it.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.160]   And so, but that's why Paul is encouraging
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.560]   the Galatians to be led by the Spirit,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.860]   to live by the Spirit,
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.160]   and to keep in step with the Spirit.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.260]   And that's our responsibility.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.660]   But what in the world does that mean?
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.860]   How do you do that?
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.660]   So that's what I want to look at with you now.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.760]   And that also goes to our opening question.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.860]   How can we be led by the Spirit
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.860]   and live lives that honor God?
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.360]   How can we say yes to what the Holy Spirit wants to do
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.260]   and see this fruit of the Holy Spirit unfold in our lives
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.760]   and see the character of Christ form us more and more
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.260]   so we look more and more like Jesus,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.360]   so we become people who contribute to the flourishing
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.060]   and the thriving to those around us,
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.460]   so we become, so we, our lives reflect the goodness of God
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.060]   in the lives of others.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.060]   So let's look at that.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.160]   So we find some clues in Galatians 5, 24 and 25.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:22.960]   So I want to read that to you.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.660]   It says that, "Those who belong to Christ Jesus
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.460]   have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.860]   Since we live by the Spirit,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.460]   let us keep in step with the Spirit."
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.760]   So how do we live by the Spirit?
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.560]   Well, first, we need to put to death daily
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   the flesh with its passions and desires.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.660]   You know, Paul talked about, "I am crucified with Christ.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.660]   It is no longer I who live, but it's Christ who lives in me.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:53.060]   The life I now live, I live in the flesh in faith in Him
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.160]   who loves me and gave Himself for me."
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.260]   That was almost correct, but not 100%.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.660]   You know, so that is, when you're a Christian,
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.860]   that's our story.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.660]   That's our narrative.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.060]   We are crucified with Christ.
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.360]   So yes, won this victory, but then on a daily basis,
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.660]   as these things come up, we need to battle them.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:14.260]   We need to engage in actually what's happening.
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.060]   We need to bring those things to Jesus.
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.860]   We can do that on our own, where we come and pray to Jesus,
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.760]   "Jesus, help me.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.960]   Give me grace.
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.060]   Give me strength to overcome this thing that's going on."
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.960]   I think a lot of times there's power in actually talking,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.160]   perhaps a close friend,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.460]   maybe it's your community group leader,
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.660]   maybe it's a pastor,
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.660]   maybe somebody from the prayer team,
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.260]   somebody you know here,
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.860]   just ask them to pray with you,
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:46.460]   to overcome and put to death the things of the flesh in your life.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.160]   And to ask Jesus for victory,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.860]   to ask the Holy Spirit to lead you
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.660]   and to give you the strength and this grace to overcome
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.560]   whatever that you are facing that is going on.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.760]   Now, the second thing is, we find a clue in verse 25.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.660]   It says, "Since we live by the Spirit,
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.260]   let us keep on step with the Spirit."
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:12.760]   Our life as a Christian begins through the Spirit.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.260]   Gospel of John talks about we are born again.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.960]   We're born of the Spirit.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.660]   That's how our Christian life begins.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.860]   That's how we are a new creation.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.660]   You know, the new has come, the old has gone.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.060]   But it's not only that we begin our life through the Spirit.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.060]   We actually also live our life by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.260]   That was something that Paul talked about
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.260]   in Galatians 3, 3 that, you know, now that you began the Spirit,
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:38.460]   why are you trying to continue in the flesh
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.560]   to gain righteousness and holiness?
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.060]   It's like you need to continue with the Spirit.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.660]   Well, it also uses here in this verse, in verse 25,
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.160]   the metaphor of keeping in step with the Spirit.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.660]   So keeping in step with the Spirit,
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:31:00.460]   that is an imagery or a metaphor of military marching.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.460]   And so for us to keep in step with the Spirit,
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.460]   we're walking step for step with the Spirit in the same, in unison.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.460]   Well, how do we do that?
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:14.060]   Well, one thing is we actually need to draw close to God.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.160]   And we draw close to God because if you want to keep in step with the Spirit,
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.560]   you need to be close with the Spirit, to walk with the Spirit,
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.060]   to be aligned with the Spirit,
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.960]   so that your life and your actions are aligned with Him.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.160]   And so we draw close to God, A, through repentance.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.760]   When we come to God and say,
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.760]   "Lord, I know the way I'm living is wrong.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.460]   Please forgive me."
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.260]   God loves to forgive us.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.460]   He loves showing us His grace.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.160]   If we confess our sins,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.860]   He's faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.460]   and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.360]   Talks about in 1 John 1, verse 9.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.760]   And so we come in repentance.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.260]   So that's one way of drawing close.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:58.760]   But we also draw close, you know, by spending time in God's Word
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.960]   and saying, "Holy Spirit, you know,
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.560]   reveal to me what you're saying, you know, through this Word.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.560]   Help me to understand this."
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.060]   We also draw close to God by prayerful relationship with Jesus
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.160]   as we live in this relationship.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.860]   And we're just prayerfully talking throughout the day.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.160]   You know, you don't have to always have a quiet place
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.060]   and be able to close your eyes to pray.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.460]   You can pray even while somebody else is talking,
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.360]   you know, with your eyes open.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.960]   And we're just living this relationship, you know, with the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.260]   And we're open, we're available for the Holy Spirit to speak to us.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.360]   And we can gain a better sense for what He's saying.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.660]   And then also we can desire, we can pray,
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.560]   "Holy Spirit, fill me, fill me with your presence.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.160]   Fill me.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.860]   Show me what it is that you desire of me.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.660]   Show me what it means to walk with you.
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.860]   And as we make that our desire, our heart's longing,
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.060]   you know, as we pour that out to God,
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.360]   He will meet us and He will empower us
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.860]   and He will give us strength to walk and keep and step with Him.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.860]   And then another part is obedience.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.260]   You know, when God tells us something, we actually need to do it.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.860]   And that's like one part that we also struggle.
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.860]   But if God shows you something, reveals something,
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.260]   you actually need to do it.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.560]   We actually need to put in practice.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   And so obedience is also a way of drawing close to God.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:33.660]   And so then finally, and so I thought that aligned amazingly with the worship,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.160]   is that we need to trust God's promises.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.260]   If we want to walk with the Spirit,
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.660]   if we want to see the fruit of the Spirit unfold in our lives.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.060]   Because here's the thing, you know,
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.560]   the fruit of the Spirit is not something that you or I can bring about in our lives.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:56.160]   It is always 100% the work of God.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   And He wants to unfold that in your lives.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   And He also will unfold that in your lives.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.060]   And so we can trust in His promises.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.660]   Now a lot of times we're overwhelmed because we're fumbling and stumbling,
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.960]   you know, through life.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.860]   Actually, I have to think of my baby girl, Ellie.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.060]   She learned walking a month ago.
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.460]   So she walks, but she's not walking that stable yet.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.760]   So she fumbles and fumbles,
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.760]   but she eventually gets to where she's trying to go.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.360]   And I think this is a picture for us
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.560]   that maybe we feel like we're fumbling, stumbling,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.460]   where we keep not being who we want to be.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:43.060]   But God promises that He will get you to where,
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.560]   you know, to where He has a plan for us.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.560]   He will accomplish His saving, His healing,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.760]   His renewing work in your life.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.260]   He will make you holy.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.960]   He will bring about the life of Christ
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.460]   that is reflective in your life.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:01.060]   He will unfold the fruit of the Spirit in your life.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.860]   And so Philippians 1, 6, it says this.
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.360]   It says, "Being confident of this,
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.260]   that we who began a good work in you
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.260]   will carry it to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.660]   So that's Philippians 1, verse 6.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.160]   Let me read this again.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.760]   "Being confident of this,
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.160]   that he who began a good work in you
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.860]   will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.860]   That's God's promise to us,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.060]   that He will bring us to completion.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.460]   And we can have faith that God is faithful.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.160]   We sang about it earlier,
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.760]   and that He will see us through.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.860]   You know, He will bring about this transformation
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.060]   in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.160]   And so we can rest in that.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.960]   And the way we do that is just by beholding by who God is,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.660]   by meditating on His Word,
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.160]   and just saying, "It's not by my strength,
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.860]   but it's by your power,
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.260]   you know, that we will overcome whatever issue you're facing,
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.660]   and He will see me through.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.360]   He will bring victory.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.060]   He will complete His work that He has begun in you."
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.860]   And so we have reason to be hopeful.
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.460]   And confident in God.
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.960]   I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   Now, some of us, you know, we've been feeling
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.160]   just this battle raging.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:32.760]   And maybe even today, as maybe even last night or this week,
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.660]   you know, we gave in to the desires of the flesh.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.660]   And you hear this morning,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.860]   and maybe this was not the most comfortable message to come to,
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:49.560]   but I believe that God wants to just pour His grace and forgiveness.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.560]   You know, it is available.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.260]   He doesn't shame you.
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:56.160]   He doesn't shame us when we come to Him with our struggles.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.760]   That's why He died for us.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.760]   And He did it willingly.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.460]   And He did it, you know, because He loves us.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.860]   And He meets us with that same love.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:09.260]   And He just wants to pour His grace, His forgiveness,
[00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.760]   you know, over you if that's you right now.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:19.260]   He just wants to reveal His love to you, remove the shame.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:24.960]   He's saying, "I love you."
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.260]   Now, others of us, we've lost trust in God.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.260]   Like we're just find ourselves in these, you know,
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.260]   struggling with these temptations and with the sin.
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.060]   And we're like, "Is God ever going to come through?
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.260]   Is He ever -- am I ever going to overcome this?
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.460]   Am I going to be eternally stuck in these habitual patterns of sin?
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:50.260]   And for whatever reason, am I able to -- is He broken in my life?"
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:57.560]   And as we heard today, the truth is that, you know, Jesus is more powerful.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.060]   He will see you through.
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.760]   He will give you victory.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.560]   Come to Him.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:09.060]   He wants to restore trust in our lives.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.560]   He wants to renew our faith in Him.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   And He wants to shut down the lie of the enemy who tells us there is no hope.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.760]   You know, you're just stuck there.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.960]   That's just where you are.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.760]   But that's a lie.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:29.260]   Jesus wants to break the power of sin in your life and give you freedom
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:34.260]   and let you walk in His freedom.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:40.260]   I want to invite you just -- everyone to stand.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.260]   Just -- if you want to just make yourself available to, you know, the Holy Spirit,
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.760]   I just want to encourage you to stretch out your hands before you.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:54.260]   And we'd just love to pray over you.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:01.260]   Jesus, I thank you that you are not finished with us yet.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.760]   We pray, Holy Spirit, come.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   We fill your people with your presence.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.760]   We fill your people with the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   We unfold this work in our lives.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.260]   There's so many areas where we're not yet who we want to be,
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.760]   not yet who you have created us to be, who you're calling us to be.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.760]   But, Lord, we're trusting you that you will give us victory,
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.260]   that your work will unfold in our lives,
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:30.760]   and that we will be more beautiful, more holy, more like you,
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.260]   as we just keep coming to you.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.760]   And, see, Lord, we desire that.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   We want that.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.260]   Lord, I pray for anyone who's, you know, just experiencing shame
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.760]   and just been overwhelmed by that.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.260]   Holy Spirit, I pray that you reveal your love, your grace,
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.760]   the love of Jesus, the grace of Jesus right now.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   That you wash away our sins, that you wash away our brokenness,
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   that you bring healing, that you bring renewal,
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   that you do something new.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   Lord, I thank you that we are a work in progress that you will complete,
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.260]   that we will be more like you, more loving,
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.760]   that we will--the fruit of the Spirit will unfold in us.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   And I pray for us as a community that we be a community.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   And I pray for when people come here that they can see the fruit of your Spirit.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   You know, how there is love, how there is generosity, how there is kindness,
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   how there is patience, how there is peace, how there is gentleness,
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   how there is self-control, and that people will know it's because,
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.760]   Holy Spirit, you are at work among us.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.760]   And so I pray for your blessing.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.760]   I pray for your strength.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   I pray for your provision over every one of us.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.200]   Thank you Jesus that you are not finished with us and we say Amen.
