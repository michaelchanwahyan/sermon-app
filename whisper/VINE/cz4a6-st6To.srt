1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
 Lord, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,320
 Everybody says, amen.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,760
 Can we thank our team?

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,840
 Wonderful.

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,680
 Have a seat, have a seat.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,120
 Say hi to somebody, say hi to someone.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
 Hi to everybody in the overflow.

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,480
 It's great to have you with us as well.

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,600
 Welcome to us.

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,480
 And so good to see you.

11
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,960
 Anybody online, it's great to have you two with us.

12
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,640
 We are so glad you're here.

13
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,480
 How's everybody doing?

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,640
 You're right?

15
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,440
 We are in week two of our Exodus series here at the Vine,

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,240
 and we're studying the book over Exodus over the next

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,520
 six months or so.

18
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,400
 And this week, we actually get into the text itself.

19
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,680
 This week, we find ourselves right at the beginning

20
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,040
 of Exodus chapter one.

21
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,280
 And this week, we're also unveiling for you

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,340
 a couple of tools that we've created in this series

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,480
 so that you can really dive deep into Exodus.

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,240
 You see, for us, our heart is is that Exodus

25
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,160
 is not just a sermon series that you come to.

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,160
 Exodus is a book that you study yourself

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,440
 over these next six weeks, next six months.

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,320
 And we want you to find yourself opening the pages

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,000
 of scripture during the week.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
 We want you to be thinking and reflecting

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,860
 about the things that we speak about on Sunday.

32
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,280
 But more than that, we want you in the text itself.

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
 And I feel like if all you do in the series

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,800
 is come on Sunday and listen to me or other preachers

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,360
 unpack a text, that's one thing.

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,200
 But if you're then diving into the scriptures yourself,

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,000
 if you're then asking God for Exodus yourself,

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,920
 if you're opening the word during the week

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,880
 and saying, God, I need this, this is a reality of my life,

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,620
 I can tell that I've got some slavery that I'm a sin to,

41
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,720
 that I'm broken and holding back from,

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,560
 and Lord, I want freedom myself, and I'm opening the pages,

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,660
 and I'm grateful that I get what I get on Sundays,

44
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,780
 but that's not enough for me.

45
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,220
 I want the scriptures to come alive for me.

46
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,560
 - Yeah.

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,820
 (laughing)

48
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,920
 - Oh, we got some ways to go.

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,960
 That's good.

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,120
 So we've created a couple of tools to help you

51
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
 to get into the word.

52
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,160
 First of all, I want you to know this series is structured,

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,840
 I told you last week is 24 weeks.

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,760
 We're gonna structure it in two segments of 12 weeks each.

55
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,880
 So between now and the end of June is part one.

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,600
 Part two will begin at the end of August,

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,160
 and we'll go all the way to the middle of November.

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,600
 There'll be a break for the summer

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,200
 for about six weeks or so in July and most of August.

60
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,680
 But we're breaking it up in two big blocks.

61
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,960
 Now, one thing that I also said last week

62
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
 is that the whole book of Exodus

63
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,600
 is structured around five movements.

64
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,680
 That's the way it's written.

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,780
 It's written in these five movements.

66
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,860
 It's also the way that we believe that all Exodus

67
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,740
 from any slavery into freedom happens in our lives

68
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,440
 through these five movements.

69
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,920
 God uses them today,

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,200
 just like he did for the Israelites back then.

71
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,680
 And those five movements, as we talked about last week,

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,120
 are slavery, promise, liberation, identity, and home.

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
 And so we've structured this whole sermon series

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,180
 around those five movements.

75
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,040
 So we want you to be able to track every single week,

76
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,940
 where are we in the book of Exodus?

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,280
 Like what passage are we in?

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,100
 We also want you to be able to track with these five things

79
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,760
 to help you to know how we're progressing

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
 through that journey.

81
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,280
 So in order to do that, we've created a tool.

82
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,560
 We've actually made a bookmark for you

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
 that you can either put in your physical Bible,

84
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,240
 or you can put in another book,

85
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
 or you can stick it on your fridge.

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,340
 The bookmark looks like this.

87
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,980
 That's the front and the back of it.

88
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,860
 And what you'll see, every single week,

89
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,000
 it has the date of that Sunday.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,160
 It has the topic that we're speaking about,

91
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,480
 but most importantly, it's got the passage of scripture

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,760
 we're preaching from or looking at as a church

93
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,960
 on that Sunday, so that in preparation, you can pray,

94
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,820
 you can read that passage for yourself.

95
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,920
 You can come on a Sunday already soaking in the word of God.

96
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,160
 And what you'll notice here is we've got the five movements,

97
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,980
 slavery, promise, liberation, identity, and home.

98
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,480
 So again, you're able to track through the whole series.

99
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,800
 So if you miss a couple of weeks

100
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
 and you're coming back to the vine,

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,140
 maybe you're away for business or whatever, or holiday,

102
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,160
 you come back, you might be like,

103
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,580
 "Where are we in the story?"

104
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,500
 Well, you've got this.

105
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,040
 It'll tell you exactly where you are.

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,500
 It'll tell you what passage we're in,

107
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,100
 and it will tell you which movement we're a part of.

108
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,400
 Is that helpful?

109
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
 You will get that next week.

110
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,740
 Yeah, babies.

111
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,900
 You gotta come back for that piece.

112
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,980
 You gotta come back for that one.

113
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,620
 We're gonna hand that one out to you guys this week.

114
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,900
 But we do actually have something

115
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,620
 for you to take home this week,

116
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,300
 and I'm really excited about this.

117
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,860
 Again, our heart in this series

118
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,780
 is not just that you hear something on a Sunday,

119
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,780
 but you'll begin to study Scripture yourself.

120
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,500
 And so one of the ways that we've done that,

121
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,580
 our creative team have done an amazing job.

122
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,700
 We have created a coffee table book for you on Exodus,

123
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,900
 and particularly Exodus part one,

124
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
 between now and the end of June.

125
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,780
 What this is is a beautiful book

126
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,720
 filled with incredible images and resource.

127
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
 Some of the stuff that we took ourselves

128
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,620
 as part of the filming, others that we have licensed.

129
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,580
 But what's most important in this

130
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,580
 is that every chapter is a devotion that we've written

131
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,060
 that connects to a specific passage

132
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,700
 that we're preaching that week.

133
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,360
 So the whole point of this

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,980
 is that we want you to come on Sunday,

135
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,200
 hear what's said on Sunday,

136
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,340
 but then we want you to go away

137
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,700
 and read a deeper reflection

138
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,300
 on what we spoke about on Sunday in your own time.

139
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,940
 These are written in a way

140
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,400
 that you can't do this in five minutes.

141
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,180
 This is not a brush your teeth devotion.

142
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,380
 This is a 15 to 20 minute,

143
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,700
 read it, pray about it, soak in it,

144
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,340
 which is why we've made it a book.

145
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,580
 It's something that you can keep at home,

146
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,020
 put in your living room, put by your bed,

147
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,820
 whatever you wanna do, and utilize it that way.

148
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,240
 These devotions have been written

149
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,740
 by one of our congregation members.

150
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,220
 His name is Chris Webster.

151
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,740
 He comes to our 2 p.m. service.

152
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,460
 He is a phenomenal writer, theologian, and thinker.

153
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,880
 And his reflections, he wrote,

154
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,500
 I actually reached out to him four years ago.

155
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,620
 I'm like, "We're gonna do this crazy thing

156
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,860
 "called the Exodus project.

157
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,700
 "We're gonna do this whole thing.

158
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,520
 "We're gonna make films.

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,920
 "I'd love you to write a devotion

160
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,100
 "for every single week of the series."

161
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,060
 And so he went away.

162
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,920
 He was very grateful that we delayed, by the way,

163
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,220
 so he could keep writing.

164
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,420
 And he went away and he wrote all the devotions,

165
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,560
 and he wrote them without knowing

166
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,640
 what I was gonna say on a Sunday.

167
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,320
 So it sits completely separate to what I'm gonna teach you,

168
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,300
 which is why it's a beautiful compliment for you.

169
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,540
 And here's the amazing thing.

170
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,460
 You get to take one of these home today, okay?

171
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,500
 We have one of these for every single person here,

172
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,800
 and it's completely free.

173
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,880
 Yes, completely free for you.

174
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,980
 You know, one of the things that we realize

175
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,820
 here at The Vine,

176
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,500
 we're a broad socioeconomic demographic here,

177
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,220
 and we don't want anyone to miss out on this resource

178
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,660
 if you can't afford it.

179
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,840
 So we decided to give it away for free.

180
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,780
 There is a catch, though, two catches.

181
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,480
 Number one, we only have enough

182
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,220
 for physically everybody across our three services.

183
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,660
 So what I do not wanna see after the service

184
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,800
 is you walking away with 20 copies like this,

185
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,660
 'cause you wanna give it to your friends and family

186
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,160
 who don't come to The Vine, okay?

187
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,420
 This is for us here at The Vine.

188
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,180
 We got enough copies for every single one of you

189
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,020
 to take a copy, but please do not take more

190
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,860
 than just your own personal copy this week.

191
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,620
 If we have any left over at the end of this week,

192
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,220
 we will make them available next week,

193
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,600
 and you can take as many as you want next week, okay?

194
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,060
 But for a starting point, just one today, is that okay?

195
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,020
 Here's the second little catch.

196
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,360
 Although I say it's free, and it is,

197
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,460
 if you would like to make a donation towards its cost,

198
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,660
 we would be very helpful,

199
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,300
 and that would be very good for us.

200
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,060
 So we're suggesting $100 donation for this

201
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,900
 if you would like to.

202
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,900
 You don't have to, again, hear my words.

203
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,980
 Please take it home for free, okay?

204
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,460
 But if you are able to, and you'd like to give 100,

205
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,820
 or maybe more than that,

206
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,500
 to help with the cover of the printing of it,

207
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,340
 we would love for you to do that.

208
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,460
 You're gonna get this.

209
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,500
 It's gonna be on the second floor after the service

210
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,380
 in the upper house.

211
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,460
 Hey, everybody in the upper house, you get a copy as well.

212
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,200
 Just come down the stairs after the service,

213
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,900
 and you can grab it from the lobby here.

214
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,760
 You don't need to rush.

215
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,540
 There's enough available for everybody.

216
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,580
 Is that awesome?

217
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,580
 - Yes. - All right, all right.

218
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,700
 So, now, there's another reason

219
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,160
 why we've made you this amazing resource

220
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,420
 that we wanted to generously give to you today,

221
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,700
 because it actually connects

222
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,620
 to what the starting point of Exodus,

223
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,780
 the book of Exodus, is all about,

224
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,560
 because the cultural and contextual backdrop

225
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,700
 to the first verses in Exodus

226
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,180
 is the idea of abundant blessings

227
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,300
 that have been handed and given out.

228
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
 The book of Exodus begins right off the back

229
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
 of the narrative from the book of Genesis.

230
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,120
 There's no break.

231
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,220
 They flow from one to the next.

232
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,860
 And what we see right at the end of Genesis

233
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,660
 is something that has happened to Joseph,

234
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,460
 Joseph, the 11th son of Jacob,

235
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,100
 Jacob, who's the grandson of Abraham.

236
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,380
 And we see right at the end of Genesis

237
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,380
 that Joseph is sold into slavery by his own brothers,

238
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,380
 and he is trafficked to Egypt.

239
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,400
 And although his circumstance is a terrible beginning,

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,460
 God's favor and honor is on Joseph.

241
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,660
 And whilst Joseph is there, Pharaoh has a dream.

242
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,240
 And Pharaoh's dream is very disturbing to him.

243
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,980
 And he asked for his own court,

244
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,080
 magicians and astrologers to interpret the dream.

245
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,700
 No one can interpret the dream.

246
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,260
 And somebody says, "There's a Hebrew in our land

247
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,120
 who has been able to interpret other dreams

248
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,960
 for other people.

249
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,260
 He might be able to interpret for you."

250
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,000
 So Pharaoh calls Joseph to him,

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,980
 and Joseph interprets the dream through the power of God.

252
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,760
 And in the dream, Joseph sees

253
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,180
 that what God is saying to Pharaoh

254
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,060
 is that there is a time coming of abundance

255
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,260
 and a time coming of famine.

256
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,800
 And Joseph basically says to Pharaoh,

257
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,580
 "Hey, we need to start storing up food now

258
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,840
 in the time of abundance,

259
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,260
 because the time of famine is coming.

260
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,380
 And if we don't have those resources available,

261
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,140
 then we're gonna really suffer in famine."

262
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,280
 Well, Pharaoh agrees, believes in Joseph.

263
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,340
 In fact, he actually empowers him

264
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,540
 to become the number two person in power over all of Egypt,

265
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,420
 in particular, over the land of Egypt.

266
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,100
 And so Joseph goes and he builds storehouses.

267
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,580
 He begins to take the grain.

268
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,820
 He stores it there.

269
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
 And when the famine years come,

270
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,460
 the nations around Egypt are really suffering.

271
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,860
 Famine hits hard, and it hits the people of Egypt hard too.

272
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,740
 But because of Joseph's insight, his wisdom,

273
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,800
 and his hard work,

274
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,460
 there is the abundance available for Egypt.

275
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,700
 Now, at this time, Joseph then goes to Pharaoh.

276
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,340
 And he says, "Look, my family,"

277
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,500
 talking about his father, Jacob, and his remaining family.

278
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,040
 At that time, there was about 70 people in Jacob's family.

279
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,300
 Joseph goes to Pharaoh and says,

280
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,580
 "Can I bring Jacob to Egypt?

281
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
 Can I bring him here as a refuge?"

282
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,940
 'Cause this land has an abundance right now.

283
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,140
 And basically, Pharaoh,

284
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,340
 because of all the incredible things

285
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,460
 that Joseph had done for him, Pharaoh agrees.

286
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,460
 And at that point,

287
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,140
 Jacob and his family are able to travel to Egypt.

288
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,700
 Now, I'm gonna show you a map.

289
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,480
 This is a modern map of Egypt.

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,280
 We're gonna use this map a lot throughout our series.

291
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,540
 It is a modern map rather than one in the ancient times,

292
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,700
 but that's because it connects

293
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,320
 to a lot of what we're gonna be teaching for us.

294
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,860
 This area up here roughly was Canaan

295
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,880
 at the time of the beginning of the book of Exodus.

296
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,380
 The modern day Israel wasn't yet boundaried like this.

297
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,480
 They lived in this area up here.

298
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,280
 And so it was from there that Jacob

299
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,900
 and his 70 people would travel.

300
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,560
 Now, this is Cairo, the modern day city of Cairo.

301
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,400
 This is the Sinai Peninsula

302
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,200
 where a lot of the Exodus narrative takes place.

303
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,060
 This is Mount Sinai right about down in here.

304
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,920
 Now, very importantly, when Jacob and his family comes,

305
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,640
 right around about here is a land called Goshen.

306
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,160
 In fact, we've got another map here

307
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,500
 that makes that clear to you.

308
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,080
 This area right here became known in the Bible as Goshen.

309
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,400
 And Goshen was the area that Pharaoh gave to the Israelites

310
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,720
 to be able to settle in.

311
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,240
 And this is where Jacob came.

312
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,680
 This is where Joseph would have spent time as well.

313
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,360
 And this is where the Israelites

314
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,700
 were able to take refuge during famine.

315
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,240
 They were able to receive the food

316
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
 that had been prepared for them.

317
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,520
 And this is the starting point of Exodus chapter one.

318
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,280
 We're now gonna start our journey.

319
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
 Are you excited?

320
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,440
 All right, here we go.

321
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,700
 Exodus one, verse one.

322
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,440
 These are the names of the sons of Israel

323
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,080
 who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family.

324
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,800
 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

325
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
 Iscah, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

326
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,960
 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Esher.

327
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,560
 The descendants of Jacob numbered 70 in all,

328
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,540
 and Joseph was already in Egypt.

329
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,920
 Now Joseph and all his brothers

330
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,740
 and all the generations died.

331
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,680
 But the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly

332
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,760
 and became exceedingly numerous

333
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,140
 so that the land was filled with them.

334
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,000
 Now I said last week that one of the things

335
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 the author of Exodus, Moses,

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,400
 who also authored Genesis, the same person,

337
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,320
 he's writing the book of Exodus using language and imagery

338
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,040
 that connects to the Genesis creation event

339
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
 of Genesis one, two, and three.

340
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,160
 And right here at the start of the book of Exodus,

341
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,720
 we see a great example of this.

342
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,040
 I wanna read to you verse seven once again.

343
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,280
 It says, "But the Israelites were fruitful

344
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,520
 "and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous

345
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,560
 "so that the land was filled with them."

346
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,560
 The words that Moses is choosing here are very specific

347
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,380
 'cause he's linking what the starting point is for Israel

348
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,520
 at the beginning of Exodus to the call that humanity had

349
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,960
 in Genesis chapter one and the call and the blessing

350
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,620
 that God gave humanity.

351
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,640
 Let me show you Genesis 1, 28, which also Moses wrote.

352
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,900
 "God blessed them and said to them,

353
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,120
 "be fruitful and increase in number,

354
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
 "fill the earth and subdue it,

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,840
 "rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air,

356
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,500
 "over every living creature that moves on the ground."

357
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,720
 So exactly what Moses is doing here

358
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,260
 is he's saying at the beginning of the Exodus narrative,

359
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,320
 there is this connection to the beginning

360
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,400
 of God's call on humanity where God said,

361
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,500
 "I'm gonna bless you.

362
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,540
 "I'm gonna bless humanity, male, female,

363
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,360
 "I've created you, you're made in my image

364
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,540
 "and you're gonna be a blessing.

365
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,920
 "And here's the blessing,

366
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,360
 "you're gonna be able to multiply,

367
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,800
 "you're gonna be prosperous,

368
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
 "you're gonna be able to fill the earth."

369
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
 And so when Moses starts Exodus, he says,

370
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,140
 "You need to know that my people are in a blessing.

371
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,380
 "You need to know where they are.

372
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,300
 "They're in this place where they're receiving

373
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,200
 "a great blessing from Egypt.

374
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
 "This place is abundant blessing to us.

375
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,800
 "And in that, we're living out the call of humanity

376
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,340
 "right in this land."

377
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,120
 Now we know what happens next in the story.

378
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,520
 We know that slavery comes.

379
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,960
 But it's really interesting that Moses,

380
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,760
 before he tells us about that,

381
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,480
 he starts with the Genesis 1 and 2 picture.

382
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,800
 In other words, it's like, almost like Moses is saying,

383
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,780
 "Our time in Egypt for 380 years before slavery happened

384
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,440
 "was like our garden of Eden.

385
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,020
 "It was an abundant place.

386
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,360
 "We had favor there.

387
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,160
 "Pharaoh liked us.

388
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,820
 "There was a beautiful environment."

389
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,700
 Now, yes, that turns into Genesis 3.

390
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,540
 That turns into the slavery that's to come.

391
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,800
 But the starting point is good.

392
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,340
 And some of you resonate with this in this room.

393
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,480
 The journey that there is

394
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,460
 between sometimes something starting well

395
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,300
 and ending up really bad.

396
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,120
 Some of you in here, it's like a relationship.

397
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,040
 It started so well, but it's turned bitter,

398
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,000
 and it's painful now.

399
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,980
 For some of you here, it's like a job.

400
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,040
 The job started great.

401
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,120
 You loved it at the start.

402
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,180
 It was a great blessing to you.

403
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,560
 But now you've become bitter, and it's annoying,

404
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,920
 and you hate it, and you wanna do something else.

405
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,400
 It's interesting how fickle the human experience is.

406
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,880
 And Moses wants to pick up on that right at the start

407
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,560
 and say, "Know that there was blessing.

408
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,920
 "Know that there was favor.

409
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,920
 "But it's so easy for that favor to change in a heartbeat."

410
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,540
 Now, at this point, all we have is Moses' word

411
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,360
 that this happened to Israel and happened to Egypt.

412
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,980
 But what actual evidence is there?

413
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,380
 I mean, before we look at anything else in the Exodus story,

414
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,980
 surely we have to start by saying,

415
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,440
 "This is actual historical truth.

416
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,300
 "We need to know that this is not just

417
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,940
 "some fairy tale myth, but it actually sits

418
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,760
 "in some actual historical truth."

419
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,100
 We're not gonna just take Moses' word for it.

420
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,580
 What is there in Egypt itself today

421
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,720
 that helps us to understand that this is the reality

422
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,580
 for God's people, that this actually took place?

423
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,020
 Well, here's an amazing thing.

424
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,440
 When I started researching this whole project for Exodus,

425
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,620
 and I was researching about the evidence that exists,

426
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,460
 I discovered a really interesting thing.

427
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,940
 There's hardly any evidence in Egypt

428
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,260
 that Israel even lived there,

429
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,400
 let alone that the Exodus happened.

430
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,980
 There's very, very, very little evidence at all.

431
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,560
 And that should concern us.

432
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,740
 Because what is this thing then?

433
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,340
 Is this book just some story that's been made up?

434
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,460
 Or does it root itself in actual archeological evidence

435
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,980
 and actual historical events?

436
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,720
 Well, to answer that question,

437
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,420
 let me take you now back to Egypt.

438
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,140
 (dramatic music)

439
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:36,420
 The first thing you need to know about the Exodus

440
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,740
 is that it's more than just an event.

441
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,580
 In fact, it's perhaps the most significant demonstration

442
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,620
 that we have in all of our scriptures

443
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,780
 of God's dealing on a daily basis with humanity,

444
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,540
 of his power and control over nations,

445
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,860
 and of course, his ability to literally change

446
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,700
 the course of history.

447
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,340
 But the Exodus is more than just old history.

448
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,660
 It's also alive still today.

449
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,900
 I mean, it's celebrated regularly by Jews

450
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,540
 at the Passover every year, and by Christians at Easter.

451
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,160
 But perhaps more than that,

452
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,300
 the Exodus has become a metaphor for revolution,

453
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,180
 for those of oppression

454
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,580
 to the social injustices of the world.

455
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,260
 I mean, from Mahatma Gandhi, from Martin Luther King Jr.,

456
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,980
 from Bob Marley, all of them have evoked

457
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,740
 the imagery of the Exodus,

458
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,960
 and have spoken about Moses' cry, "To let my people go."

459
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:36,400
 All of which is fascinating

460
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,860
 when you consider one sobering fact.

461
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,740
 There's actually very little archeological evidence

462
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,820
 that Israel was ever in Egypt,

463
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,660
 let alone that the Exodus actually happened.

464
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,500
 I mean, could it be that the Exodus is some fairy tale myth

465
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,340
 invented by religious leaders to teach us a moral

466
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,580
 about good versus evil, oppression versus freedom?

467
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,420
 I mean, could it be that we've been believing a lie,

468
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,460
 albeit a very inspiring and motivating one?

469
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,620
 Well, to begin to answer that question,

470
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,380
 I've come here to Beni Hassan,

471
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,780
 a small village just south of modern-day Minya

472
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,580
 in Middle Egypt, to a series of remote tombs

473
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,260
 that are cut into the hillside

474
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,500
 to uncover perhaps the only physical proof

475
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,900
 there is in this whole country of Semitic people

476
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,660
 arriving in the land of Egypt itself.

477
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,100
 This is a breathtaking place to bury your dead.

478
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,580
 The people buried here are actually

479
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,580
 from the elite class of nomachs.

480
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,140
 They were provisional governors here

481
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,420
 in the Middle Kingdom period,

482
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,940
 about 4,500 years ago.

483
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,460
 Now, there are 39 tombs here in Beni Hassan,

484
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,300
 and each one of them has an outer court,

485
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
 an inner pillared room, and then a shaft

486
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,740
 that leads down to the burial chambers.

487
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,220
 But we haven't come all this way

488
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,540
 for me to show you things that are dead and buried.

489
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,700
 Today, we've come here so I can show you something

490
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,740
 that is still very much alive.

491
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:06,700
 These tombs are covered from floor to ceiling

492
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,740
 in vibrant, beautiful, living art.

493
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,140
 The paintings here depict everyday scenes

494
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,660
 of the common life of this area at the time,

495
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,500
 as well as stories about their history and livelihood,

496
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,420
 their homes, and their culture.

497
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,060
 Standing in the tomb here, I really get a sense

498
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
 of the sheer scale of this place,

499
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,740
 which is why it's a little bit boomy and echoey.

500
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,740
 But when you look at the beauty in the art here,

501
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,980
 it amazes me 'cause it tells me something

502
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,260
 about the culture of this people,

503
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,300
 that at the end of their lives, when they bury themselves,

504
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,420
 they want to be surrounded with story.

505
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,780
 They want the future generations to come here

506
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,100
 and not learn about how they died, but how they lived.

507
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,420
 They wanted to tell them about their experiences

508
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,300
 and help them to get to know them personally.

509
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,740
 I mean, this blows my mind.

510
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,540
 I mean, us in the West, when we die,

511
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,700
 we just erect a tombstone with a couple of words on it.

512
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,060
 But in this culture, they wanted to really communicate

513
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,220
 the heart of who they were to the future generations.

514
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,620
 And as a storyteller myself, this truly just inspires me.

515
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,500
 And it's actually amongst all of this storytelling

516
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,180
 that our Exodus journey truly begins.

517
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,860
 This might be a small section

518
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,940
 of the overall paintings in these tombs,

519
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,300
 but its significance to us cannot be overstated.

520
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,980
 What you see here are figures wearing a fashion

521
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,020
 that is completely different to any other people

522
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,620
 depicted in these tombs.

523
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,380
 Their upper bodies are covered,

524
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,140
 and their clothes are of a striped red and spotted nature.

525
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,140
 This was the clothing of the Semitic people of the time.

526
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,860
 And the scene here depicts a story of Asiatic migrants

527
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,500
 arriving in Egypt with the hopes of starting a new life,

528
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,940
 making this the only recorded history we have

529
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,860
 in the whole of Egypt of the arriving presence

530
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,700
 of a Semitic people in this land.

531
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,580
 From religious fairy tale myth

532
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,900
 to recorded historical evidence,

533
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,740
 these tombs tell us a story we all need to hear.

534
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,700
 God's people did indeed come to this land.

535
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,900
 But the question remains, did they actually settle?

536
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,260
 Well, to answer that question,

537
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,740
 I need to take you about 200 miles north

538
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,140
 to a land that the Bible calls Goshen.

539
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,900
 (dramatic music)

540
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:40,500
 These fields behind me here may not look like much,

541
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
 but hidden underneath them

542
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,220
 is some of the most significant archeological evidence

543
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,540
 for the existence of God's people here in Egypt.

544
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,700
 This area around me is known as Goshen.

545
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,220
 It's found actually in Genesis 47,

546
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,940
 as well as in Exodus chapters eight and nine.

547
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,860
 And Goshen is the very place where God's people lived

548
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,800
 for the 480 years that they were here present in Egypt.

549
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,380
 Now, unfortunately, much of that evidence

550
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,380
 is still under the ground here.

551
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,640
 But there is one place,

552
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,860
 not too far from where I'm standing right now,

553
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,540
 where they've been able to excavate.

554
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,620
 And what they found there is truly significant.

555
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,900
 Unfortunately, it's not a public place,

556
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,060
 so I wasn't able to get in there and film,

557
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,020
 but we were given some footage.

558
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,180
 And that footage reveals to us

559
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,660
 what it would have been like for God's people

560
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,960
 to live in this land.

561
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,300
 These pictures and artist renderings

562
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,180
 show what is essentially the site

563
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,620
 of an ancient home here in Avaris.

564
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,060
 In the excavation, you can clearly see various rooms,

565
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
 as well as the walls

566
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,340
 and the general structure of the house as a whole.

567
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,820
 Now, the form of the house is not in the style

568
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,620
 of Egyptian homes in the time of the Exodus,

569
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,940
 but it's actually North Syrian in its form and construct,

570
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,340
 the area that the patriarchs were originally from.

571
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,380
 This particular house has become known

572
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,820
 as the House of Jacob,

573
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,380
 and archeologists have found something fascinating

574
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,060
 in the garden surrounding it,

575
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,060
 a portico with 12 pillars.

576
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,180
 Is this coincidence, or is it further evidence

577
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,900
 of the presence of the settlement of a Jewish people

578
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,700
 celebrating in their architecture

579
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,380
 the 12 tribes of their generation?

580
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:26,880
 Either way, the home that is being discovered

581
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,000
 not too far from where I'm standing right now

582
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,100
 proves to us something beyond the shadow of a doubt.

583
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,280
 You see, Beni Hassan showed us

584
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,780
 that a Semitic people arrived in Egypt.

585
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,580
 The House of Jacob shows us that they settled here.

586
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,340
 (dramatic music)

587
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:57,020
 - It's a really important thing

588
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,620
 that we can base the story of Exodus

589
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,220
 in actual recorded history for us.

590
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,740
 But as I said earlier,

591
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,020
 sometimes the fate and the blessings of somebody

592
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,660
 can change in a heartbeat.

593
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,700
 And as is so often the case when a immigrant group

594
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,100
 grows to prominence and power within a nation,

595
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,300
 the majority group of that nation can often fear

596
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,340
 and respond in tragedy and evil.

597
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,180
 And that's exactly what we see happen here.

598
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,980
 Let me read on from verse eight.

599
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,740
 Then a new king, and by king, when it's mentioned here,

600
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,660
 it's always referring to a pharaoh.

601
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,260
 Then a new pharaoh, who did not know about Joseph,

602
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,060
 came to power in Egypt.

603
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,560
 "Look," he said to his people,

604
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,300
 "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.

605
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,820
 "Come, we must deal shrewdly with them,

606
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,620
 "or they will become even more numerous.

607
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,620
 "And if war breaks out, we'll join our enemies

608
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,620
 "and fight against us and leave the country."

609
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,220
 The pharaoh begins to freak out,

610
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,180
 that this pharaoh has no connection to the Jewish people.

611
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,420
 He has no connection to the pharaohs of the past

612
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,820
 who were influenced by Joseph and his wise decision-making.

613
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,960
 He has no connection.

614
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,860
 It's been over three generations have passed

615
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,860
 as this person now comes into power.

616
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,780
 And because he's got none of that connection,

617
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,580
 he just sees this Israelite group

618
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,340
 as a massive group of people

619
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,420
 that he knows are not Egyptian, and he fears them.

620
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,340
 Now, it's really interesting,

621
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,740
 'cause Moses uses a specific word in verse 10

622
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
 to describe this.

623
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,900
 He says, "Come, we must deal," this is pharaoh speaking,

624
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,540
 "Come, we must deal shrewdly with them."

625
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,020
 That's exactly the same word that's found in Genesis three,

626
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,700
 when Moses writes about Satan as a snake.

627
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,380
 He says the snake was more shrewd or crafty

628
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,020
 than any of the other animals.

629
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,580
 Remember, this is still Moses writing.

630
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,700
 He takes that same word that he applies to Satan,

631
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,620
 and he puts it right on pharaoh straight away.

632
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,780
 And basically what he's saying here is pharaoh

633
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,900
 is in this narrative going to be like for us the snake.

634
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,180
 He's going to be the one

635
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,180
 who is gonna have influence over us,

636
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,360
 and he's the one that's gonna make decisions

637
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,420
 that are of the enemy, not of God.

638
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,420
 And Moses wants us to understand the satanic influence,

639
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,980
 the evil that sits behind all the things

640
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,300
 that pharaoh does next.

641
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,700
 Let me read it to you from verse 11.

642
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,740
 So they put slave masses over them

643
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,780
 to oppress them with forced labor.

644
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,940
 They built Pithom and Ramesses as store cities for pharaoh.

645
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,980
 But the more that they were oppressed,

646
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,640
 the more they multiplied and spread.

647
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,380
 So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites

648
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,820
 and worked them ruthlessly.

649
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,940
 They made their lives bitter with hard labor

650
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,020
 in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields

651
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,700
 and in all their hard labor,

652
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,360
 the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.

653
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,340
 There's this power that comes from Egypt on Israel.

654
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,380
 They're thrown into slavery,

655
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,860
 and that slavery is painful, it's hard,

656
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,420
 and it's in the totality of who they are.

657
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,440
 Now, I want you to see something really important here.

658
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,280
 What Moses is trying to communicate to us as we read this

659
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,700
 is a simple starting point of slavery.

660
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,620
 He's trying to help us to understand

661
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,820
 that there is a key starting point

662
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,380
 that happens so often in slavery,

663
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,840
 and that's the starting point of insecurity.

664
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,740
 You see, Pharaoh here acts insecurely before his people.

665
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,020
 He looks at this migrant group who've grown to a big size,

666
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,900
 and they've never done anything to make Pharaoh

667
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,800
 think that they're gonna rebel against him,

668
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,500
 but he's so afraid of that,

669
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,300
 and in his own insecurities of losing control

670
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,060
 and losing his own power,

671
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,300
 he decides to suppress them

672
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,940
 in order to make sure that he would increase.

673
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,660
 And what you need to know is that insecurity

674
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,540
 is so often the primary brokenness

675
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,580
 that actually enslaves and oppresses other people.

676
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,260
 Say that again.

677
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,500
 Insecurity is primarily, often,

678
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,820
 so often the primary brokenness

679
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,500
 that is the driving factor

680
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,300
 that would enable people to be enslaved and oppressed.

681
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,960
 That's what insecurity does.

682
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,140
 And Moses is trying to get us to know this

683
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,580
 because actually throughout the whole Exodus journey,

684
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,020
 you're gonna see time and time again

685
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,380
 the issue of insecurity rising up

686
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,220
 and then the issue of needing to deal with it before God.

687
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,620
 This is why one of the movements

688
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,460
 of the five movements of Exodus is all about identity,

689
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,580
 because when our identity is broken,

690
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,780
 we operate out of a place of insecurity.

691
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,140
 And insecurity happens because we look at ourselves

692
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,380
 and we look at others and we make comparisons between them

693
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,080
 and we make assumptions between them.

694
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,160
 And you'll recognize in your own life

695
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,480
 that your insecurities will always tempt you

696
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,060
 to suppress others in order to elevate yourself.

697
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,400
 Are you guys with me?

698
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,640
 And if that's the case,

699
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,640
 here's the key that Moses is giving us

700
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,760
 right at the start of the story.

701
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,240
 He's saying, if there's one thing that you could do

702
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,040
 to align yourself to the process of Exodus,

703
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,960
 if there's one thing you could do to position yourself

704
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,920
 for more freedom in your future,

705
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,200
 it's deal with your insecurities.

706
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,260
 And how do we deal with our insecurities?

707
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,820
 We don't deal with them

708
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,980
 by trying to become more secure in ourselves.

709
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,400
 We don't try to convince ourselves

710
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,860
 that we're actually not as bad as we think.

711
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,060
 We don't try to convince ourselves

712
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,980
 that we've got power ourselves.

713
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,060
 No, what we do, this is what the Bible says,

714
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,380
 the only way you free yourself from insecurity

715
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,860
 is not finding security in yourself,

716
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,060
 but finding more security in God.

717
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,940
 By actually looking out of yourself and looking to Him

718
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,540
 and saying, I will follow Him,

719
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,860
 I will trust Him, I will put my promises,

720
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
 my life, my faith in Him.

721
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:32,140
 As I find my security in Him,

722
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,840
 I'm able to deal with the insecurities that sit in me.

723
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,900
 See, as we become more secure in Christ

724
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,900
 and who we are as His children made in the image of God,

725
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,660
 we become less a vehicle of slavery and injustice

726
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,180
 and more a vessel of freedom and grace.

727
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,060
 That's the journey of Exodus.

728
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,260
 And Moses is saying, get that right here,

729
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,100
 right at the start.

730
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,060
 And I wanna speak that over every person in this room.

731
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,340
 If there's one thing I invite you to deal with

732
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,860
 over the next 24 weeks is to bring your insecurities to God.

733
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,140
 He's got you.

734
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,980
 And He, let me say it this way.

735
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,820
 There is no other name more powerful than the name of Jesus.

736
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,340
 We just sang it, but we sing it.

737
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,480
 Do we believe it?

738
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,860
 And if we believe it,

739
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,260
 then we're able to move away from our tendency

740
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,240
 to enslave and oppress others

741
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,360
 and become more like Christ

742
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,920
 wanting to bring freedom and grace in this world.

743
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,520
 And there's an army rising up

744
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,480
 of people that are willing to do that.

745
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,700
 That, my friends, is an echo of Exodus.

746
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,840
 Now, what does this slavery feel like?

747
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,860
 What was it like to be found in slavery in those days?

748
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,520
 What was it like to actually be oppressed?

749
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,240
 Was it just a physical thing or was it much more than that?

750
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,860
 And were men and women enslaved in the same way?

751
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,260
 Well, to answer those questions,

752
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,420
 let me take you back once again to Egypt.

753
00:30:52,420 --> 00:31:07,700
 We are introduced to the starting point

754
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,820
 of the Exodus narrative in Exodus 1:8-11,

755
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,900
 where we learn of a new king who comes to power in Egypt

756
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,560
 and immediately places Israel into slavery.

757
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,220
 I mean, literally overnight, their freedoms are gone

758
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,100
 and they're suddenly thrust into forced labor,

759
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,820
 constructing storehouses

760
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,880
 as well as temples of Pharaoh across the land.

761
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:34,440
 One such temple is here at Tel Basta,

762
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,780
 some 80 kilometers northeast of modern-day Cairo.

763
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,240
 Built for the worship of the feline goddess Bastet

764
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,540
 some 3,500 years ago,

765
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,660
 the temple now lays here in ruin

766
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,540
 but gives us a unique insight

767
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,660
 into the kind of slavery the Jewish people were placed under.

768
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,420
 Standing here today and being surrounded by all of this

769
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,940
 is an incredibly rare privilege.

770
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,760
 I mean, these are 3,500-year-old antiquities.

771
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,820
 And being here, I get a great sense of the grandeur

772
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,260
 and the size that this temple would have been.

773
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,940
 It would have taken thousands of slaves years to construct it.

774
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,460
 And take, for example, the granite here.

775
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,340
 This granite is not from around here.

776
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,780
 It's probably from a quarry about 1,000 kilometers away.

777
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,620
 So the slaves would have had to have dragged this here

778
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,260
 and then shaped and constructed it on site.

779
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,620
 I mean, that's incredibly backbreaking work

780
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,820
 in the harsh climate of this land.

781
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:42,420
 Not only this, but the slaves also would have had

782
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,500
 to spend their days carving out idols of gods

783
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,940
 that they refused to worship

784
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,660
 and worldviews that they refused to accept.

785
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,460
 Case in point is seen here.

786
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,020
 This is the image of Ka.

787
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,460
 It's two arms pointed to the heavens,

788
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,300
 which in ancient Egyptian religion symbolized the soul.

789
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,440
 But notice something.

790
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,900
 There's no head and no real body to it.

791
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,500
 And that was on purpose,

792
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,120
 'cause this was communicating that our connection

793
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,920
 of our soul to the gods is devoid

794
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,440
 of any of our personal identity.

795
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,940
 Now, think about the Jewish slaves and their worldview.

796
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,860
 They worshiped a god that they saw as a good father,

797
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,420
 who they understood created them in the image of their god.

798
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,780
 So the idea of kind of taking away the identity

799
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,260
 from our worship of God

800
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,760
 would have been actually deeply offensive to them.

801
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,700
 All of which actually raises a really important point

802
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,020
 for each of us to reflect on

803
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,840
 as we think about our own journeys from slavery to freedom.

804
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,940
 You see, slavery is never just merely physical.

805
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,440
 It involves the whole of who we are.

806
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,700
 The mental, emotional, and social toll on the Israelites

807
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,640
 in constructing this temple was just as cruel

808
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,200
 as the physical toll that was required to do it.

809
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,160
 And I think actually that that was the main point.

810
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,060
 You see, in constructing this temple,

811
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,060
 it was designed not just to break

812
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,140
 the Jewish people's physical backs,

813
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,100
 but their spiritual ones as well.

814
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:13,320
 There was one further aspect of slavery

815
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,820
 that was unique to the Israelites here in Egypt

816
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,320
 and actually profound for shaping

817
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,420
 the whole of the Exodus itself.

818
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,660
 And to tell you about that,

819
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,660
 I now need to take us from the temple here in Tel Basta

820
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,580
 to the remote turquoise mines of Sinai Peninsula.

821
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,060
 The Sinai Peninsula is nicknamed the land of turquoise

822
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,340
 by the local Egyptians that live here.

823
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,180
 The mining of it dates back to the first dynasty

824
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,360
 when Egyptians sourced it from the coastal mines

825
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,240
 and mountains of this area.

826
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,620
 And while much like today,

827
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,420
 it was originally used for jewelry and ornaments,

828
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,460
 its adoption by many pharaohs created a mythology around it

829
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,060
 centered on the idea that the stone was a protector

830
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,100
 and bringer of good fortune.

831
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,820
 So many Egyptian women wore the stone

832
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,320
 in hopes of becoming pregnant

833
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,820
 that the goddess of fertility, Hathor,

834
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,900
 was eventually called the mistress of turquoise.

835
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,480
 (gentle music)

836
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:38,080
 The turquoise that is mined in this area

837
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,920
 is some of the purest in the world

838
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,760
 and it really is so vivid and so beautiful.

839
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,960
 But as is often the case in life,

840
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,920
 sometimes the things that are most beautiful on the outside

841
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,700
 are actually distracting us

842
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,780
 from the things that are dark within.

843
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:06,460
 This is a small example of the mines

844
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,660
 that are found scattered in the mountains in this area.

845
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,260
 Now, the actual turquoise itself is mined from the veins

846
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,820
 that you can see here in the ceiling and on the walls

847
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,000
 and then sent for processing at the plants in this region.

848
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,140
 Now, the earliest evidence suggests

849
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,580
 that the mining was done here

850
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,980
 by local Sinai inhabitants at the start.

851
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,460
 But as the turquoise gained in its popularity and demand,

852
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,320
 they needed to ship in some additional labor force.

853
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,080
 So it was here in the hills of Sinai

854
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,140
 that many Jewish slaves were forced to come to work,

855
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,420
 spending countless hours in cramp and awkward conditions,

856
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,000
 often in the dark, digging and excavating

857
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,100
 for the precious stone that would go on

858
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,060
 to adorn the rich and powerful.

859
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,680
 And here is what is important about all of that.

860
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,760
 You see, unlike the muscle and brawn

861
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,760
 that was needed to construct the temple in Tel Basta,

862
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,040
 the work here in these caves was intricate and detailed

863
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,560
 and very repetitive.

864
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,240
 It was work that was done largely by women.

865
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,480
 I want you to think on this.

866
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,880
 Imagine a thousand enslaved Hebrew women in these caves,

867
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,660
 working day in, day out to mine a precious stone

868
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,560
 that would go on to be adorned by Egyptian women

869
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,520
 to symbolize their freedom and power.

870
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,380
 And if that wasn't kind of ironic enough,

871
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,840
 the actual ancient Egyptian goddess of justice

872
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,820
 came to be symbolized by turquoise.

873
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,600
 Yeah, the goddess of justice.

874
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,720
 I think for the Jewish women enslaved in these caves

875
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,360
 for hours upon hours, surely turquoise was anything but.

876
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:52,680
 So slavery impacted both men and women alike,

877
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,240
 whether it was in temples or in caves,

878
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,100
 in cities or in deserts,

879
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,200
 the Jewish people were placed under a brutal regime

880
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,020
 that impacted their mental, physical, social,

881
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,840
 and spiritual lives.

882
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,000
 Indeed, the oppression was so strong

883
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,580
 that in order to stop it,

884
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,580
 it would require an equal but opposite force

885
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,740
 that was so powerful that actually the whole of history

886
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,300
 itself turned on its axis.

887
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,460
 And how did that power begin?

888
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,380
 Well, Exodus chapter one introduces us

889
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,620
 to two Hebrew unnamed midwives

890
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,220
 who have the courage and the audacity

891
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,860
 to finally stand up against an empire of injustice

892
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,460
 and draw the line in the sand and say enough is enough.

893
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,460
 Deliverance so often begins in the most unlikely of places.

894
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,480
 Would you like to meet these two women?

895
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,480
 - Yes. - Yes.

896
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,580
 - Yes.

897
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:56,240
 - Exodus one, starting in verse 15.

898
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,440
 The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives

899
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,720
 whose name was Shifra and Pua,

900
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,960
 when you help the Hebrew women in childbirth

901
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,800
 and observe them on the delivery stool,

902
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,360
 if it's a boy, kill him,

903
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,980
 but if it's a girl, let her live.

904
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,160
 The midwives, however, feared God

905
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,960
 and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do.

906
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,000
 They let the boys live.

907
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,760
 Just a few verses here that Moses includes,

908
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,800
 but this is the most incredible turning point

909
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,480
 in this whole story,

910
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,040
 because the very first people that stand up

911
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,140
 against an evil empire and an evil regime are two women,

912
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,320
 two women who have the courage

913
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,880
 when Pharaoh has told them to do something,

914
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,040
 and remember, they're slaves,

915
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,680
 so they actually have no choice whether they do it or not.

916
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,480
 They're expected to carry it out.

917
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,800
 They decide that enough is enough

918
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,840
 and it's time to make a change,

919
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,080
 and Moses, who's writing this,

920
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,340
 it's fascinating to me because Moses was steeped

921
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,880
 in the culture of patriarchy.

922
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,640
 He understood the culture of patriarchy

923
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,040
 and the way that men were seen as the movers

924
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,920
 and the shakers and the change agents,

925
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,680
 and he says, "You need to understand,

926
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,120
 "before I'm even on the scene,

927
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,160
 "the people that really change history are two women,

928
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,600
 "two women that are willing to stand up

929
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,080
 "at a time when they so easily

930
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,580
 "could have just turned a blind eye

931
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,480
 "and say, 'This slavery is wrong.'"

932
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,560
 The Bible describes them here as Hebrew midwives.

933
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,920
 Now, the profession of being a midwife,

934
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,960
 midwifery in those days, was incredibly important.

935
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,120
 In fact, in the ancient Near Eastern time,

936
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,320
 particularly in Egypt,

937
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,760
 infant mortality rates were incredibly high,

938
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,320
 so the profession of being a midwife was very respected,

939
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,380
 and often family would put their trust

940
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,560
 in a particular midwife to ensure

941
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,480
 that their child would be delivered alive or not.

942
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,440
 In other words, they saw that the midwives

943
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,960
 held in their hands literally the power of life and death,

944
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,280
 and in Egypt in particular,

945
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,880
 these midwives were deeply revered.

946
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,480
 They were revered because of the superstitious

947
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,920
 and supernatural belief that the Egyptians had

948
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,120
 around life and death and birth and that sort of thing,

949
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,360
 and so they would see these midwives

950
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,780
 as actually very important people within society.

951
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,380
 Now, we know that these particular midwives are actually,

952
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,980
 'cause they're Hebrew, they would have been slaves.

953
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,980
 Now, because Pharaoh deals with them,

954
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,000
 it shows both the respect to the role they had,

955
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,500
 but it was also likely that these two midwives

956
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,120
 were midwives within Pharaoh's wider harem,

957
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,900
 probably within his house in particular,

958
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,820
 and he says to these two Hebrew women,

959
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,240
 "Hey, when the men are delivered,

960
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,220
 "when you deliver a boy, kill him right there

961
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,060
 "and right there."

962
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,880
 Now, you might think,

963
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,780
 "Why would a Hebrew kill another Hebrew in those moments?"

964
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,220
 Again, you got to remember, this is slavery.

965
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,940
 This is a time when when you're given an order,

966
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,080
 you never doubt it, and you do what it says.

967
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,060
 Not only that, though, history will tell you

968
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,300
 that so often when a majority culture

969
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,420
 wants to do a genocide on a minority culture,

970
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,220
 so often that power will get members of the minority culture

971
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,500
 to carry out the genocide itself.

972
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,460
 That has happened throughout human history,

973
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,900
 and here we see another example of it.

974
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,140
 And so Pharaoh expects these two women to act.

975
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,380
 Now, the other interesting thing

976
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,200
 about being a midwife in those days

977
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,120
 is that midwives themselves were chosen for that role

978
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,180
 largely because they were infertile and barren.

979
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,940
 These are women that weren't able

980
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,180
 to bring their own children into the world,

981
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,120
 and because of that, they were then selected

982
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,080
 to bring the children of other people into the world.

983
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,060
 Now, you can imagine that could either be viewed

984
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,720
 as a bit of an embarrassment, a bit of a shame,

985
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,880
 or that could be viewed as a great gift.

986
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,780
 And we don't know what it is

987
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,800
 for these two particular women,

988
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,520
 but we do know that they are childless.

989
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,680
 We do know that they have no families of their own,

990
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,800
 and we know that there are slaves within Pharaoh's harem,

991
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,080
 and they're responsible for now committing genocide.

992
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
 And they decide that this is not what they're gonna do.

993
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,320
 And I want you to see why.

994
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,460
 It says here in verse 17,

995
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,240
 "The midwives, however, feared God."

996
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
 There it is.

997
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,200
 Very simple thing, feared God.

998
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,240
 And this fear of God was greater for them

999
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,160
 than the fear of Pharaoh.

1000
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,800
 And by fearing God, they're not,

1001
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,560
 this word is actually repeated a lot

1002
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,600
 throughout the Old Testament.

1003
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,000
 It's not about this idea of afraid or scared,

1004
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,720
 but feared God is the idea of reverence and awe

1005
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,640
 and worship and respect and humility of saying,

1006
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,800
 "God is all-powerful.

1007
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,960
 "He is all-holy.

1008
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,640
 "We're not, and we need to worship Him,

1009
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,600
 "respect Him, be in awe of Him."

1010
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
 That's the idea of fearing.

1011
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,360
 And what Moses tells us here is that these two women

1012
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,920
 who are named Shiphrah and Puah,

1013
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,600
 these two women are actually fearing God.

1014
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,920
 And because they fear God,

1015
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,440
 they're able to take a stand

1016
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,800
 against what's happening to their people,

1017
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,920
 and they're able to take a stand

1018
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,320
 against what they've been told to do,

1019
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,000
 which is to do genocide.

1020
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,160
 Now, here's the important thing.

1021
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,620
 All of this is Moses trying to communicate to us

1022
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,800
 one really critical piece

1023
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,120
 right at the start of the Exodus story.

1024
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,080
 He's trying to say,

1025
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,000
 no matter how powerful slavery might be,

1026
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,440
 no matter how powerful the force of slavery might be,

1027
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,440
 there exists in the world a power that is greater than it.

1028
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,920
 And that power is the courage

1029
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,040
 that comes upon us as humans

1030
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,040
 that is fueled and driven by our fear of God.

1031
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,640
 And that courage enables these two women

1032
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,280
 to realize that despite how strong slavery was,

1033
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,080
 it did not remove the power of their choice.

1034
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,880
 They still had a choice.

1035
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,160
 And their choice was obey Pharaoh's order and live

1036
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,180
 or disobey Pharaoh's order and die.

1037
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:59,360
 And they choose death to themselves

1038
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,720
 so that others might live.

1039
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,520
 Now, I want you to see why this is really important.

1040
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
 Note this.

1041
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,680
 The Hebrew midwives choose death for themselves

1042
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,560
 so that others might live.

1043
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,200
 That is the exact opposite of what insecurity does.

1044
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,240
 Insecurity ensures a life for yourself

1045
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,040
 through the death of others.

1046
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
 Are you with me, church?

1047
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,160
 Do you follow this?

1048
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,680
 And so what Moses is saying is

1049
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,760
 there's Pharaoh in insecurity

1050
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,600
 who's enslaving the Israelites

1051
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,800
 and calling out for genocide.

1052
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,340
 Here's two women who stand up against it

1053
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,360
 because they decide that they have the courage

1054
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,800
 in their fear of God,

1055
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,520
 that they're saying he is more powerful,

1056
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,720
 he is more honorable,

1057
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,000
 I'm gonna listen to him over anything else.

1058
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,680
 And they're willing to even sacrifice their own lives

1059
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,880
 so that others might live.

1060
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,360
 That's the exact opposite of insecurity.

1061
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,680
 And Moses is saying, check out the power of these women.

1062
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,240
 That when you're willing to stand in the gap

1063
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,420
 against injustice,

1064
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,040
 when you're willing to stand in the gap against enslavery,

1065
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,080
 when you realize that you still have the power to choose,

1066
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,440
 then Exodus happens.

1067
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,240
 The beginning of our Exodus story

1068
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,760
 is the incredible story of two women

1069
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,360
 who make an overtly political decision

1070
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:18,360
 to stand against the political authority of their day

1071
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,080
 and fear God first.

1072
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,200
 And that changes everything.

1073
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,480
 That literally is the starting point of everything.

1074
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,320
 The courage to choose life over death.

1075
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,320
 And what Moses is asking of everybody reading this,

1076
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,360
 right at the start of the story,

1077
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,520
 it's essentially this,

1078
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,760
 whom ultimately will you serve?

1079
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,640
 Come on church.

1080
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,480
 Whom ultimately will you serve?

1081
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,840
 Will you serve me?

1082
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,920
 He's saying, this is God,

1083
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,960
 will you serve me or will you serve her?

1084
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,280
 Will you serve life or will you serve death?

1085
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,560
 Will you serve the things of the flesh in your soul

1086
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,960
 or the flesh in your sinful nature

1087
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,920
 or will you serve and fear me and want to please me?

1088
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,000
 Which will you choose?

1089
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,600
 He's basically saying.

1090
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,680
 Because here's two women

1091
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,680
 who are under the oppression of slavery from Pharaoh

1092
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,040
 and they make a choice for life.

1093
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,400
 And then there's us.

1094
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,280
 And we have to think,

1095
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,920
 are we in such a situation that they're in?

1096
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,640
 Like are the choices that we're making ones

1097
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,200
 where we could literally die?

1098
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,320
 And yet how often do we choose death over life?

1099
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,600
 Yet how often do we choose to remain enslaved

1100
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,600
 rather than move into life?

1101
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,160
 You see, Shifra and Pua teach us

1102
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,920
 that we don't have to be passive in the face of evil.

1103
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,840
 Shifra and Pua actually teach us

1104
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,480
 that we don't have to adopt the role of victim in a story.

1105
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,120
 Shifra and Pua actually teach us that when we fear God,

1106
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,560
 we can find the courage inside of us

1107
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,880
 to actually stand against the darkness of our day

1108
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,400
 and say enough is enough

1109
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,840
 and flex the one muscle that always breaks through

1110
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,040
 and that's the muscle that is no.

1111
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,880
 This is enough.

1112
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,000
 This is done.

1113
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,840
 We are not gonna do what you say.

1114
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:13,200
 And in the beauty of this, Exodus begins.

1115
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,400
 And I want you to see what God is doing here.

1116
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,160
 And this is so beautiful to me.

1117
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,800
 You see, note this.

1118
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,600
 The very instruments that Pharaoh had chosen

1119
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,720
 to carry out his plans

1120
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,920
 became the very instruments that God uses

1121
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,520
 to thwart those plans.

1122
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
 Isn't that powerful?

1123
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,360
 Because Pharaoh wanted to use the women to kill the kids.

1124
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,280
 That was his desire.

1125
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,560
 He wanted to use these women to kill the kids,

1126
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,080
 to kill the men that were being born.

1127
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,240
 And God steps in and says,

1128
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,840
 I'm gonna use those very instruments to change the world.

1129
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,120
 I'm gonna use those very instruments

1130
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,760
 to be the starting point of no.

1131
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,280
 I'm gonna use those very instruments

1132
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,200
 to be the beginning point of all that I'm gonna do

1133
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,000
 in the rest of the story.

1134
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,160
 You see, what Pharaoh wanted to do

1135
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,200
 was bring women under subjugation.

1136
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,120
 Notice this, women who are the carers

1137
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,960
 and the givers of life are chosen by Pharaoh

1138
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,400
 to be the destroyers of it.

1139
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,200
 And these women say, no, that's not our role.

1140
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,120
 That's not who we are.

1141
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,960
 We are not the destroyers of life.

1142
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,080
 We're the carers and the givers of life.

1143
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,200
 And these two midwives say, we're the deliverers of life.

1144
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
 And I want you to see the powerful prophetic thing

1145
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,240
 that's happening here.

1146
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,040
 These two women are basically saying,

1147
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,120
 our role is to deliver life and not death.

1148
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,840
 And so right at the start of the story,

1149
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,960
 you see two women delivering Hebrew children to life.

1150
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,160
 And this is a prophetic announcement

1151
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,240
 of what God's gonna do next in the story,

1152
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,160
 where he delivers a whole nation from death to life.

1153
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,680
 But in the starting point,

1154
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,800
 it's a microcosm on these two women.

1155
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,040
 And I think essentially what they're saying is this,

1156
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,280
 hey, we're all midwives.

1157
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,080
 We're all midwives.

1158
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,800
 And we might not be delivering children,

1159
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,920
 but we are delivering choices.

1160
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,720
 The most spiritual act you will ever do

1161
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,400
 is the act of a choice.

1162
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,720
 Right at the end of the Exodus,

1163
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,160
 and I'm jumping forward a little bit,

1164
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,680
 Moses stands before his people and he says,

1165
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,200
 today I give you life and death.

1166
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,760
 Choose life.

1167
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,760
 He says, me and my household, we're gonna choose life.

1168
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,480
 And I wanna stand before you

1169
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,440
 at the beginning of your own Exodus.

1170
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,160
 As you thought about your departure point last week,

1171
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,440
 and you think about Exodus that's ahead here,

1172
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,440
 and I know the stories,

1173
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,880
 oh, Angie, if only you understood

1174
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,040
 the slavery that you're under.

1175
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,760
 And here's two women,

1176
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,120
 already under the slavery

1177
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,640
 of a patriarchal society and culture,

1178
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,120
 but equally under the slavery of Pharaoh and Egypt,

1179
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,800
 who say we still have the power to choose life.

1180
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,480
 My prayer for you as you start this journey

1181
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,360
 is that you would find in the fear of God,

1182
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,280
 in your relationship with Him,

1183
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,160
 the courage you need to say no

1184
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,560
 to whatever it is that is enslaving you.

1185
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,240
 The courage that you need to say,

1186
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,800
 I'm gonna make better choices.

1187
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,920
 The courage that you need to say,

1188
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,120
 I'm not gonna be tempted by that sin anymore.

1189
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,440
 The courage that you need to say no

1190
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,760
 where you have been saying yes.

1191
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,080
 And as you take that courage,

1192
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,880
 you align yourself to the freedom that comes,

1193
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,280
 not with the insecurity that wants to enslave,

1194
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,800
 but the fear of God that wants to bring life.

1195
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,400
 Can I pray for you guys?

1196
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,280
 Would you stand with me?

1197
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,120
 Let me pray.

1198
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:37,880
 Father, I thank you so much for Shifra and Pu'er

1199
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,120
 and for the legacy they leave behind to us.

1200
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,280
 I thank you so much, Lord,

1201
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,440
 for the way in which they live their lives.

1202
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,400
 I thank you that we have,

1203
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,800
 in Moses' recounting of their story, their names.

1204
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:57,040
 It's fascinating to me that we never hear the name of Pharaoh

1205
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,880
 but we are given the name of these two women.

1206
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,120
 And so for 3,500 years, they've been known.

1207
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,960
 And we know their names because they decided

1208
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,280
 that they still had a power of choice.

1209
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,440
 And they were willing to go to their death

1210
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,280
 so that others might live.

1211
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,160
 They were willing to sacrifice their freedom

1212
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,160
 so that others might find freedom.

1213
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,480
 And as Moses brings us to the picture of these women,

1214
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,080
 he's really bringing us to the picture of ourselves.

1215
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:32,440
 And he's saying, who it is

1216
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,800
 that you're ultimately gonna follow, me or Pharaoh?

1217
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,840
 Are you ultimately gonna think you're a victim?

1218
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,640
 Or are you gonna realize that because my spirit is in you,

1219
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,080
 same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead in you,

1220
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,080
 that together we can work towards freedom

1221
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,400
 and the chains can break.

1222
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,800
 There is no greater name than the name of Jesus.

1223
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,160
 And as we put our security in him,

1224
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,560
 we find ourselves becoming vessels of freedom and grace.

1225
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,480
 Father, I wanna pray that you would move

1226
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,880
 over each person here now.

1227
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,960
 And Father, I ask that you would give them courage, Lord.

1228
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,480
 Courage for the journey ahead in Exodus.

1229
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,200
 Courage to say no to the things that they need to say no to,

1230
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,400
 yes to the things they need to say yes to.

1231
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,320
 Courage to stand against the work of sin in their lives.

1232
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,480
 Courage in the fear of you to know that they don't need

1233
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,880
 to be giving in all the time to the temptations around them.

1234
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,280
 Courage to start making better choices,

1235
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,360
 better decisions for their families,

1236
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,760
 for their marriage, for their children.

1237
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,040
 Courage for their marriages, for their relationships.

1238
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,840
 Lord, I pray you'd fill us with the courage

1239
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,200
 that you filled those two women with.

1240
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,920
 That in our fear of you, the awe, the worship,

1241
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,200
 and the majesty of you,

1242
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,600
 your spirit would work to set us free.

1243
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,840
 I encourage you just to bring that before the Lord

1244
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,880
 in your own way right now.

1245
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,440
 Ask for his courage.

1246
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,720
 Commit yourself in fear of him, in that awe,

1247
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,680
 in the respect and the wonder of him.

1248
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,840
 And through that,

1249
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,800
 put yourself right at the starting line

1250
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,120
 of everything that he wants to bring to you.

1251
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,720
 (gentle music)

1252
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,320
 (gentle music)

1253
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,920
 (gentle music)

1254
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,520
 (gentle music)

1255
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,120
 (gentle music)

1256
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,720
 (gentle music)

1257
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,320
 (gentle music)

1258
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,920
 (gentle music)

1259
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,520
 (gentle music)

1260
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,120
 (gentle music)

1261
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,120
 (gentle music)

1262
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,120
 (gentle music)
