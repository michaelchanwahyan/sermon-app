[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   Amen.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.640]   Thank you worship team for leading us.
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.800]   That was beautiful.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.640]   Thank you church.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.080]   You guys can have a seat.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.200]   Get yourselves comfortable.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.160]   Good afternoon, my name's Ellison.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.120]   It's an honor to be sharing God's word with you today.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.880]   And yeah, the sun's shining,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.800]   so everybody got here nice and dry.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.120]   That's really good.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.460]   Glad to be here.
[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.240]   Well I'm not sure if you've noticed
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.200]   in the songs that we sing,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.960]   in the popular songs that we sing,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.320]   there is this sentiment, right?
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.440]   For some reason, there's this idea out there
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   that to go a long distance for the one you love
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.640]   is really, really romantic.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.360]   Okay, it's something really beautifully romantic about that.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.960]   As the saying goes,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.280]   distance makes the heart grow fonder, right?
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.920]   Technically, I guess what that means
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.880]   is the further you are apart,
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.120]   the more romantic it is, right?
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.680]   So I can testify to this a little bit.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.720]   There was a period for about nine months, right,
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.080]   when Brittany and I were dating long distance,
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.200]   nine, 10 months.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.840]   I was here in Hong Kong, she was back in Texas.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.360]   And I have the receipts, okay?
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.400]   I'm not lying, okay?
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.420]   And she's sitting right there, so you can ask her.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.780]   For nine months, every single day,
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.880]   I wrote a handwritten letter,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.720]   put it in the mail, and sent it over to Texas, right?
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.940]   Sometimes it'd just be one word,
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.640]   like hello, or whatever, right?
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.320]   Sometimes it'd be like a little doodle I did during the day.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.100]   But pretty much every single day,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.840]   I would send a letter by mail to Brittany, right?
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.440]   And it was a good thing, right?
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.120]   Yeah, we still have those letters.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.420]   If you ever wanna come over for dinner, I'll show you, okay?
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.200]   But there's that idea out there.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.120]   We sing about it, there's popular songs about it.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.960]   This is kinda old now, I'm dating myself.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.720]   But do you remember the soundtrack
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.840]   for the first Space Jam movie,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.600]   the original Space Jam movie with Michael Jordan, right?
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.800]   There was a song there called "For You I Will"
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.840]   by a pop star called Monica, right?
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.240]   And the lyrics go like this,
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.680]   I would cross the ocean for you.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.120]   I would go and bring you the moon, all right?
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.240]   I would be your hero, your strength, anything you need.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.000]   Right, a song that's made popular again,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.680]   or actually I don't think it's ever been not popular,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.700]   the Proclaimers, right?
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.780]   It's really famous, right?
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.780]   I would walk 500 miles, and I would walk 500 more, right?
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.000]   To be the man who walks 1,000 miles,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.080]   1,000 miles to end up at your door.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   Right, Vanessa Carlton, you know, the do-do-do-do-do-do,
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.400]   you know, she also walks 1,000 miles, right?
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.360]   To just be with the person that she loves.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080]   Tonight, right, that's how she thinks.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   But it's kinda silly, right,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.840]   when you think about these things.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.080]   Because, okay, I'm sorry, Monica,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.200]   but you are an R&B pop star, you're not an astronaut,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.640]   you're not a nautical expert, okay?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.200]   Do you know how even the smallest ocean
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   is 14,000, 140,000 square kilometers wide?
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.120]   The moon is more than 380,000 kilometers away from Earth.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.640]   I'm not sure she's capable of going to the moon and back.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.920]   The average walking pace of someone,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.160]   unless you're Carla Roscoe, who walks like lightning speed,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.120]   is about three to four miles per hour.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.680]   If you were to walk 1,000 miles without taking any breaks,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.880]   the song should really go,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.360]   I would walk 1,000 miles to see you in about two weeks.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.800]   Not tonight, right?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.480]   So, it's ridiculous, right?
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.240]   These things are just hyperboles,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.000]   these things are just imagination, right?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's romanticized way of expressing our love for someone.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.800]   But what would you be willing to do?
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.640]   Like, how far would you be willing to go
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.160]   for the one you love?
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.700]   These days, if you ask me,
[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.460]   my distance and romance is a bit more limited, right?
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.600]   I get annoyed these days when after I sit down
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.960]   and Brittany goes, can you go and get me a glass of water?
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.640]   I'm like, all the way to the kitchen and back?
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.680]   Like, really?
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.120]   Like, I don't really have the energy for that, right?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.200]   So, maybe I could do with being a bit more romantic
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.880]   these days as well.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.240]   But we like the idea of this, right?
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   We like the idea of someone doing something
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.120]   spectacular for us, of someone going all the lengths
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.460]   to the end of the world and back.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.240]   It's romantic, it's good, but no one actually expects
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.480]   their loved ones to do these kind of things for them,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.320]   do they?
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.600]   But here's the thing, and as cheesy as this sounds,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.200]   I have to tell you, somebody has.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.600]   All right, this is one of the key points
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.400]   we like to emphasize when it comes to the Christian faith.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.480]   We have a savior who left his home in heaven,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.860]   came down to earth, took on sin and darkness
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.620]   and shame and evil and injustice and all this other way
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.960]   the world's been messed up, died the death
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.920]   that was meant for us just because he loved us
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.000]   and he wanted to be near to us.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.520]   And so in this process, we've been brought near to Jesus,
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.800]   he has also made us new.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.480]   And we have been made new to carry out the many
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.020]   wonderful things that he has prepared for his children
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.360]   to do.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.900]   This was a beautiful reminder, this was the message
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.040]   that Pastor Andrew said to us last week.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.880]   But this is just the starting point.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.360]   And if we want to know his love, his grace,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.000]   his mercy and forgiveness, if we want to know
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.240]   the nearness of Christ, then there is a part
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.120]   for us to play as well, as his children,
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.560]   as his church, as his people.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.040]   Being close to Jesus isn't just about soaking it all in
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.200]   and being in that space, but there's a challenge
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.960]   for us too, when we receive his love,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.360]   there is something we have to do with it.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.360]   And so we come to a point in our journey
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.920]   through the book of Ephesians, because like we said,
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   yes, we've been blessed by God.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.440]   Yes, our hope is in Christ.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.260]   Yes, we have this resurrection power at work within us.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.020]   We've been raised to life by God, but there's one reminder.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.800]   God didn't do it just for you, the individual.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.640]   He did it for everybody.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.760]   And so if he did it for everybody, it means everybody
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.600]   is being brought near to Christ, which means
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.760]   there has to be unity as we're being brought together
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.120]   as one body.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.360]   The question is, how?
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.160]   How do we have this unity in Christ?
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.080]   And the passage we're looking at today
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.680]   is gonna tell us a little bit about that.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.160]   So I'm gonna read it, and we're gonna go through it
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   and see what God has to say to us.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.000]   Ephesians chapter two, verses 11 to 22.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.800]   It says this.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.240]   Therefore, remember that formerly you who were Gentiles
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.120]   by birth and called uncircumcised by those
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.600]   who call themselves the circumcision,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.240]   which is done in the body by human hands.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.560]   excluded from citizenship in heaven,
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.040]   and foreigners to the covenants of the promise,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.840]   without hope and without God in the world.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.080]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who were once far away
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.900]   have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.420]   For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.640]   and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.720]   by setting aside in his flesh the law
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.400]   with his commandments and regulations.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.480]   His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.280]   out of the two, thus making peace.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.240]   And in one body to reconcile both of them to God
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.600]   through the cross by which he put to death their hostility.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.240]   He came and preached peace to you who were far away
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.820]   and preached to those who were near.
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.920]   For through him we have both access
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.640]   to the Father by one spirit.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.720]   Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.160]   but fellow citizens with God's people,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.440]   and also members of his household,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.060]   built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.480]   with Jesus Christ himself as the chief cornerstone.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.320]   In him the whole building is joined together
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.440]   and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.200]   And in him you too are being built together
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.160]   to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.040]   So let's go back to Paul.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.640]   Let's go back to this time in Ephesus.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.000]   As we know, it's not an easy situation
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.520]   that Paul is speaking to when this letter that he wrote
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.040]   reached the people of Ephesus.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.760]   Apart from the culture of the pantheon of gods
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.840]   that different people worshipped,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.000]   there was also the very open and hostile division
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.920]   between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.360]   The Jewish people stood firm on their faith
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.680]   in the part of God's history as his chosen people.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.160]   And there were a few things that marked them out as such.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.840]   And circumcision was one of these main things.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.800]   That's the main emphasis of what Paul's trying to say here.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.740]   Now the act of circumcision itself, of course,
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.700]   is rooted in their history.
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.680]   Given to Abraham by God, Genesis 17,
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.780]   the point of circumcision was a physical sign
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.320]   of the covenant that God had given his people.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.460]   It was like a physical marking of you are separated
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.600]   to be a part of God's people.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.380]   And so therefore circumcision became one of those things
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.360]   that was used against non-Jews to keep them separate.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.160]   If a Gentile man wanted to enter into the community of God,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.040]   the people of God, it was expected
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.400]   that he would have to be circumcised.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.320]   This was the established mindset at the time.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.080]   Which is why the point Paul is making here
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.960]   sounds actually really, really shocking.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.560]   It would have sounded really shocking.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.040]   Because Paul makes it obvious to the readers,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.720]   to the hearers, to the listeners.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.920]   It's obvious that circumcision, he says,
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.860]   no longer carries the importance that it used to.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.200]   And one of the reasons he's saying that
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.380]   is because now it's actually being used to exclude people
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.560]   from entering into the community
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.880]   that God has called them to be.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.680]   Right, Galatians 5, 6, Paul says this in a different way.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.720]   For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.600]   nor non-circumcision has any value.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.660]   And why is this?
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.440]   Because Paul tells us circumcision is something
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.120]   that is done in the body by human hands.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.440]   Now when Paul says by human hands,
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.980]   that's also significant here.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.440]   Because against the backdrop of the idol worship of Ephesus,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.920]   using the phrase by human hands,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.140]   that's the same phrase that people would use
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.500]   to describe the idols that were being made
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.060]   by the people in Ephesus at the time.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.080]   Those too were made by human hands.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.280]   Right, lifeless, powerless objects.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.120]   Not made by God, not designed by God,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.000]   but only by humans, by their hands.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.340]   And so therefore, by talking about circumcision
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.920]   in the same way, you would say that Paul's talking,
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.760]   this is circumcision, it's just like these idols.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's become a little bit irrelevant, right?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.280]   It's got no power, it's no longer a critical part
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.720]   of your identity as God's chosen people.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.040]   Now, what has this got to do with us?
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.720]   I just said circumcision 13 times, okay,
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.420]   in the past two minutes.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.660]   What does this have to do with us?
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.920]   Well, let me ask you this way.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.400]   What practices do we currently hold
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.940]   to keep people out of community with us?
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.680]   But yet, actually, this is something that's worthless
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.040]   in the eyes of God.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.880]   We might not have something as physical,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.240]   as outward as circumcision,
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.360]   so it might not be as obvious to us,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.720]   but it's something we got to be asking ourselves,
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.080]   because if there are such barriers,
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.800]   then we need to name them for what they are,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.600]   and name them for the worthless things they are,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.440]   because they have no place in the community of God.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.320]   Because as we're about to find out,
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.120]   there ought to be no barriers for those
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.120]   who want to enter into the community of Christ.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.280]   No man-made barriers for those who want to enter
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.940]   into the community of Christ.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.360]   So let's think about it this way, right?
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.480]   If you're here listening today,
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.520]   if you would call yourself a follower of Jesus,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.960]   think back.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.400]   Think back to when, before you became a Christian,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.180]   before you came to know Jesus.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.920]   What was your life like back then?
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.440]   Like most people, like myself,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.900]   you probably wrestled with a lot of doubt, right?
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.460]   Questions and challenges as you began to come to grips
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.500]   with what it means to be a life,
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.360]   to live a life as a Christian, as a Christ follower.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.320]   Right, there's probably already enough obstacles
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.240]   that you had to overcome without people
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.080]   putting more barriers up in the way.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.540]   In fact, being separated from Christ,
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.360]   it's a terrible place to be, Paul says.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.120]   There's five things that you are at a disadvantage at
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.520]   before you knew Jesus, okay?
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.400]   These are, okay, these are the things.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.660]   You are separated from Christ,
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.080]   you are excluded from citizenship,
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.760]   foreigners to the covenant, without hope, without God.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.160]   This is the way Paul is describing the Gentiles, okay?
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.300]   But it's also relevant to us.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.680]   Before you come to know Jesus,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.560]   before you are in God's people,
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.720]   these are the five things that you are
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.760]   sort of at a disadvantage for.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.300]   And they come together to make a point,
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.400]   so let's talk about it.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.560]   Firstly, being separated from Christ, right?
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.160]   Means you probably didn't even have the idea
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.760]   that there was a salvation that you needed, right?
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.480]   That there was a savior out there
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.560]   that would come to rescue humanity,
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.360]   that you were a sinner, indeed, of rescuing from your sins.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.880]   Right, because like what Pastor Andrew said
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.160]   last week as well, right,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.840]   back then you were spiritually dead, right?
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.540]   Dead people do not have the ability
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.200]   to raise themselves from the dead.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.960]   Dead people need a savior, need someone to intervene,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.640]   to give them the resurrection power
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.020]   to raise them from the dead.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.840]   You cannot save yourself.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.340]   You needed rescue.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.400]   So that's what it means to be separated from Christ.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.000]   Now, because the Gentiles weren't part
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.920]   of God's original people as well,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.760]   they also didn't share in the first covenant,
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.320]   the blessings and the promises
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.840]   that God had originally planned for his people, right?
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.320]   The Abrahamic, the Mosaic, the Davidic covenants,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.440]   they weren't a part of that.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.360]   They were outsiders, which means back then
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   they couldn't participate in God's promises.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.640]   And therefore, that means they also had no hope
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.280]   because they had no God.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.400]   Well, maybe they had a little bit of fake sense of hope
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.000]   and a little bit of idea of some gods, right?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.280]   As we have discovered, there were so many gods
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.960]   that people, the Gentiles of Ephesus,
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.200]   before they came to know Jesus,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.920]   were probably worshiping all sorts of different gods
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.000]   and idols that were a part of the culture.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.640]   And in the same way, it probably was for us too.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.160]   Before you came to Jesus,
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.920]   think about the things you used to put your hope in.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.880]   Right, think about the things you might use to worship.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.600]   Some of us might have come from homes and households
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.720]   that literally worship idols.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.240]   For others, it might be idols of power and prestige
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.600]   and all these things in culture
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.960]   that we tend to put our hopes and dreams in.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.480]   Whatever it is, this isn't true hope,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.080]   and this isn't putting your hope in the true God.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.460]   We lack connection to the one true God.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.240]   We lack connection to hope,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.820]   God who is the source of all life.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.440]   So it's not a good picture.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.960]   It's pretty clear what Paul's trying to say.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   We, like the Gentiles, were once about as far away
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.620]   from God as one could be.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.840]   So let me ask you again, think about it.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.840]   Do you remember a time when you were far away from Jesus,
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.160]   when you did not know him as your savior?
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.680]   Or perhaps if you're listening right now
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.240]   and you don't quite know Jesus as your savior yet,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.880]   maybe you're sitting here listening,
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.160]   you're just exploring,
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.560]   you've heard a little bit about this Christianity thing,
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.740]   but you're not sure how legit it all is,
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.080]   and you're wondering, what is this talking about?
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.980]   What is this hope, what is this God?
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.640]   Let me say this very clearly, and I say this with love.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.400]   At one point, all of us have been separated from Christ.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.000]   All of us, right?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.320]   And because we were separated,
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.440]   we weren't part of his promises.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.320]   Of course God loves all people,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.640]   but there's a certain benefit, there's certain promises,
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.240]   there's certain function as God's children
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.500]   that you can only know once you enter
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.580]   into a relationship with him.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:28.140]   The point is this, being separated from Christ
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.340]   is not a good place to be.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.600]   In fact, being separated from Jesus
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.900]   is probably the worst state that you could find yourself in.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.420]   And I know that sounds drastic,
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.940]   but I don't say it lightly either, right?
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.220]   Because I know amongst us, in this church,
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.160]   in our city, in our world,
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.000]   there are people in so many different situations
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.740]   walking through some terrible things,
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.040]   walking through pain, trauma,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.640]   stuff that you can't even think of,
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.040]   things you wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.560]   These things are tough, and yes,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.680]   when we see people walking through these things,
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.480]   we need to walk alongside them, fight for them,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.560]   pray for the healing, bring justice
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.080]   to those who are suffering.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.720]   But I would say this, a person who is suffering,
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   who is in pain, but who knows and is connected to Jesus
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.940]   is ultimately in a better place
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.080]   than someone who is comfortable,
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.380]   but is living without hope and without God.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:30.180]   To be living in this world without hope and without God
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:35.180]   is a true tragedy, and it's as true then as it is today.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.420]   But this is the good news.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.820]   But now, Paul says, but now,
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.940]   we don't have to live this way.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.260]   We don't have to live a life separated from God.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.720]   We don't have to live a life separate from Jesus.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.380]   We can enjoy his blessings.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.620]   We can live in the calling and the purpose
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.160]   that he gives to us.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.340]   We have that hope.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.460]   We have God because in Christ Jesus,
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.460]   you who were once far away have been brought near
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.080]   by the blood of Christ.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.760]   Jesus has done that for us.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.460]   We have been brought near by Christ
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.620]   through his sacrifice, through his blood.
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.540]   And amen and praise God for this.
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.600]   This is the part that we could have never done for ourselves.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.740]   Jesus has given us life.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.740]   His incomparably great power has been at work within us,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.580]   and this is nothing we can do for ourselves.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.460]   And we can't do anything else but say thank you
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.160]   and accept his grace and his love and his mercy.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.860]   But like I said, that's just the starting point.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.260]   And being brought near to Jesus means a new era,
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.380]   a new season, a new direction in your life has begun.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.340]   A new way to live is on offer.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.480]   And this new way to live is not just about
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.740]   a certain group of people now.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.140]   It's not just about individuals being brought close
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.540]   to Christ, but this is talking about all people,
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.900]   Paul is saying Jews and Gentiles alike.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.620]   Two people that were once enemies with each other
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.300]   have now come together to become one,
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.300]   and this is where the challenge is.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.780]   Because this new way to live involves peace.
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.300]   And it involves peace not just the peace
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.540]   that you have with God, but peace with each other.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   It involves everyone living as if there were
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.980]   no barriers between us, living as if nothing
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.340]   would be able to separate us from each other.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.500]   Paul goes on to say this.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.660]   and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.500]   of hostility by setting aside in his flesh
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.380]   the law with its commands and regulations.
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.700]   His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.940]   out of the two, thus making peace.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.860]   And in one body to reconcile both of them to God
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.660]   through the cross, to which he put to death,
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.680]   by which he put to death their hostility.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.740]   Peace.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.480]   Right, peace, this is the word that the world
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   is crying out for at the moment.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.260]   Apart from the bigger, more obvious wars
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.180]   that we see in our news feeds every day,
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.700]   Ukraine and Russia, Israel and Palestine,
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.500]   dominating the news 24/7 these days,
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.580]   but actually there's about 110 other armed conflicts
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.180]   going on in the world right now.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.180]   We need peace.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.620]   We want peace in this world.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.180]   And indeed, we could do a whole sermon series
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.820]   on war and violence and how it breaks God's heart,
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.620]   the injustice of war, and when we see these things,
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.740]   we get moved to pray, right, we want these conflicts to end
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.360]   and we get passionate, we start social media campaigns,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.180]   all that kind of stuff, and this is good.
[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.180]   We want to raise awareness about these things.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.480]   Great, that's fine.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.460]   But perhaps before we wanna do something
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.940]   about these major wars we see around us,
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.680]   we need to address the conflicts and hostilities
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.340]   that lie closer to home.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.800]   And this is what I wanna focus on today.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.000]   Right, because for Paul and the Ephesians,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.040]   these hostilities were close to home, right?
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.680]   They were between the Jews and the Gentiles.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   The prejudice, the hatred, the racism
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.800]   between the two groups was intense for many reasons.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.320]   And so Paul's saying, we need to deal with this.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.720]   We need to break down any hostility,
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.480]   any barriers that are stopping us
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.440]   from coming together as one right now.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.000]   And so circumcision was one of those things,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.680]   but the other thing that was keeping them separated
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.080]   was the Old Testament law.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.580]   The Old Testament regulations that God had once
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.880]   commanded them to live by.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   Now here's the thing.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.240]   For a season, the Old Testament laws
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.240]   were given to the Israelites were good, right?
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.960]   They were used to protect them
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.740]   from becoming like the nations around them.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.200]   You see what happens when you read through the Old Testament.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.040]   Every time the Israelites step away from those boundaries,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.520]   right, they get carried away, they start worshiping idols,
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.200]   then God has to send all sorts of ways
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.960]   to let them know they've gone wrong, right?
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.360]   And then they start the whole cycle over again, right?
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.920]   Wait, first kings, second kings,
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.840]   all these kind of things keep happening
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.200]   because the Israelites fail to live in the regulation,
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.620]   in the protection of the laws that God has given to them.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.160]   Now for a season, those were good.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.560]   But very quickly, these laws also became
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.120]   a source of pride and arrogance.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.080]   Meaning instead of being a fence to protect the Israelites,
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.040]   they started using it as a wall, as a barrier,
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.520]   as a sign of hostility to prevent people from coming in,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.000]   to exclude people, to say, we're the people of God,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.520]   we don't want you to be a part of us.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.980]   Right, people became so focused
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.300]   on following these rules and regulations,
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.700]   they forgot that the purpose of these rules
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.160]   was to keep them close to God in the first place,
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.840]   not to make themselves look good as rule followers
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.320]   and as regulation followers.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.780]   This is why Jesus gets angry
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.700]   with some of the religious leaders and Pharisees
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.840]   of his time.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.120]   He calls them things like brooder vipers
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.560]   and whitewashed tombs.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.840]   You look good on the outside, but in reality,
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.960]   your hearts are far away from God.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.180]   Remember this, the point is that we have been brought near
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.600]   by the blood of Christ.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.880]   And on the cross as Jesus died,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.840]   his blood fulfills the old covenant.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.980]   And so now, those who want to worship God
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:31.720]   don't have to do through rules and rituals and sacrifices,
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.680]   they simply have to come.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.320]   In doing so, Jesus' death killed the hostility
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.100]   between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.680]   The one who was slain also slayed the hate
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.800]   between two groups that were at enmity with each other.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.520]   And so the result is this, something beautiful,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.200]   even something surprising.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.480]   See, the plan all along wasn't to make Gentiles
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   become more Jewish so they could join
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.240]   into the nation of Israel.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   His plan was to create in himself one new humanity
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.400]   out of the two, thus making peace.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.120]   This was never about conforming one people group
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.660]   to become more like the other,
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.920]   not about Gentiles making them Jewish
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.400]   or Jewish into Gentiles.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.320]   It was always about creating something new,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.840]   which is the body of Christ.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.720]   It's almost romantic, the union of two groups
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.580]   coming together in one humanity.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.200]   It sounds a bit like what Jesus says about marriage.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.520]   The two become one flesh.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.240]   They are no longer two, but one flesh.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.480]   And so good, right?
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.040]   Bravo, we cheer at this.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.760]   This is amazing.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.280]   Two groups that were once at conflict with each other
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.520]   coming together to create something even more beautiful.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.140]   It's like a fairy tale come true.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.080]   Everyone likes that story.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.960]   In fact, if you might say, actually, you know what?
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.320]   We've done this as a church.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.280]   We're good.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.000]   I mean, look around us.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.020]   There's people from all over the world
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.480]   sitting with each other.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.000]   We have peace.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.900]   There's no fighting within our worship services.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.380]   I don't really hear people cursing at each other.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.620]   We're super friendly in this church.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.420]   We're friendly, we invite new people.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.000]   We even do the awkward thing sometimes
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.060]   when we sit down and say hello to your neighbor
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.260]   and no one ever goes, "Ee, not this person," right?
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.160]   Yeah, we're good here.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.380]   We even pray with each other sometimes, right?
[00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.480]   Isn't that great?
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.900]   Okay, yeah, I will give us that.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.520]   We don't have the very obvious Gentile Jewish divisions
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.720]   that Paul was talking about.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.640]   We might not be openly fighting with each other, right?
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.580]   It's not the USC every time we gather together to worship.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.680]   At the same time, I don't think we should be so naive
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.600]   to say that we've got everything right
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.320]   and there's no work to be done in creating unity and peace
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.800]   within this family, this body of Christ.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.400]   I would say we shouldn't be so blind
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.620]   that in fact there might be some wars and hostilities
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.100]   that we hold against each other.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.900]   But here's the problem.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.380]   It's hard to see where these hostilities lay
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.420]   when you're not at the receiving end of them.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.980]   It's hard to see where people do not feel at peace
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.400]   when we don't put ourselves in the shoes
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.320]   of those on the receiving end of injustice.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.700]   Something I experienced myself really opened my eyes to this.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.020]   So a few years ago, we were visiting my wife's wife.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.080]   I say that three times, I said that now.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.560]   I said it every time.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.800]   My wife's wife, who's that, Kayla?
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   I don't know, right?
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.300]   My wife's family in Texas.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.080]   We took a road trip.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.840]   And one of the stops we had on this road trip
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.120]   was in Nashville.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.360]   We were going from Texas all the way up to Buffalo,
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.760]   into Niagara.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.640]   So we looked at a nice, long road trip.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.800]   And one of the stops was Tennessee.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.280]   And I was super excited.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.560]   Tennessee, the home of country music.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.240]   I have to admit, I love country music.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.520]   I might not look like it, but I love country music.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.720]   Country music and hip hop.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.280]   That's what dominates my Spotify playlist.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.320]   Ask Emma and Promise, one of these days
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.040]   I'm gonna lead worship doing a country song
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.600]   and we'll see how it goes.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.920]   But Nashville, is there anyone from Nashville
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.640]   or been to Nashville?
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.560]   Beautiful city, right?
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.920]   Amazing food, great atmosphere.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.720]   But you walk down the high street, the main street,
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.440]   and there's about a thousand cowboy hats,
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.800]   aspiring musicians, a beautiful place.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.320]   And so we decided to go to one of the honky tonks
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:37.840]   that they have.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.800]   A honky tonk, by the way, is one of those bars
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.400]   that you go, it's like a dance hall.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.240]   Live band, play music, you can have a beer,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.340]   sit with people and have a good time, dance,
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.480]   and do all that kind of stuff, okay?
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.200]   So, imagine the scene.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.800]   Here I am, a Chinese guy, walking into this honky tonk
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.220]   with my white Texan wife, hoping to have a good time.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.480]   But the moment I walk in, right, and it wasn't everybody,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.720]   but I just felt this two pair of eyes
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.260]   just staring at me immediately, the moment I walk in.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.940]   Right, and I see that the man kind of leans over
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.720]   to the woman, whispers something in her ear,
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.560]   and having a conversation back and forth with each other,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.160]   there's visibly pointing at me now.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.400]   Okay, I have to admit, I didn't hear what they said,
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.000]   right, they could have been, whoa, look at that guy,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.040]   he's super cool, right?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.920]   They could have been saying that, okay,
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   but that wasn't the vibe I got from them,
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.420]   that wasn't the sense I got from them, okay?
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.520]   What they were communicating actually was,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.240]   what are you doing here?
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.200]   You see that guy that just walked in?
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.400]   Why did he just walk in here?
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.000]   He doesn't belong in here.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.740]   Obviously, they didn't want me there.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.200]   Now, apart from Brittany, who was with me,
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.800]   no one else noticed, right?
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.280]   The rest of the people that were with didn't notice, right?
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.120]   Why should they?
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.280]   No one's ever looked at them in that way,
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.960]   no one's ever judged them in that way.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.520]   They've been to a thousand honky tonks.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.020]   Every time they go in, they have a fun,
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.760]   they have a good time, all right, it's great.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.240]   But for me, the night was over, all right?
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.040]   Then the moment that happened, I just wanted
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.880]   to get out of there as quickly as possible,
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.920]   and so we left.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.900]   Okay, let's bring it a bit closer to home.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.720]   When I walked into the building this morning,
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.360]   as I do every Sunday, when I walk in, I feel good.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.040]   I feel confident, right?
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.760]   I feel like I belong here.
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.120]   I don't worry about how people are gonna treat me.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.880]   I don't feel like people are gonna say,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.200]   "You're not supposed to be here."
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.040]   I've never experienced anything like that here.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.500]   People are always kind and friendly and respectful.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.720]   For some strange reason, some of you even want
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.640]   to come and speak to me, okay?
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.520]   It's great for me.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.820]   But I wonder if we could confidently say
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.920]   that this is the same experience everyone has
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.500]   when they come into this building.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.100]   I wonder if this is the same experience
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.640]   that people can say they have when they go
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.160]   into other places, other establishments here in Hong Kong.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.560]   I wonder for some if coming even here to the Vine,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.220]   walking into this church building for worship on Sunday
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.020]   might feel a bit like me walking
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.480]   to the honky-tonk that night.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.620]   Perhaps for some of us, coming here every Sunday,
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.980]   there's just a bit of nervousness,
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.780]   a little bit of worry about whether or not
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:28.240]   people are gonna treat me with respect.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.220]   Maybe some of us come into this space feeling
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.380]   there are walls, there are unspoken rules
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.720]   and hostilities between us as a body of Christ.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.320]   Just because you haven't felt it or seen it
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.920]   doesn't mean it's not happening.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.400]   In fact, one of the most powerful barriers
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.720]   that happen without us even realizing it,
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.640]   and it's one of the ways it happens most frequently,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.920]   is with our language and the way we speak
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.040]   about each other and other people.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.160]   And I'm speaking specifically to Cantonese,
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.080]   Hong Kong Chinese, Cantonese speakers here.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.760]   But even if you're not a Cantonese speaker,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.240]   you can probably contextualize it to apply it
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.560]   to your own identity, your own culture
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.140]   from what your sphere is.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.380]   Because I would say this, a lot of Cantonese language
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.880]   is very casually racist, not even low-key racist,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.180]   like properly racist.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.320]   Common racial slurs in Cantonese,
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.180]   terms like hak kwai when we're referring to black people.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.800]   Things like a-tah or a-sing when we're referring
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.000]   to Indian, Pakistani, and South Asian people groups.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.520]   These are terms that Chinese Cantonese speakers
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.060]   say behind the backs of these people
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.760]   as a derogatory way of referring to them.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.080]   You could even say guai lo is sort of like
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.000]   embraced right now as a term, but if you think about it,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.680]   the origins of that aren't very friendly either.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.140]   Or what about the way we refer to our Filipino sisters?
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.620]   The term ban muy when we're talking about
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.920]   our Filipino foreign domestic workers.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.240]   In fact, when it comes to them, right,
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.500]   we forget that they are human beings sometimes.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.960]   Some of the conversations over here are shameful
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.680]   when it comes to the way we refer to our Filipino sisters
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.960]   who live and work in the city, serving our families.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.240]   Often they're talked about like they're commodities.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.280]   Oh, this one's not good, this one's not good at that,
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.080]   this one, and then they talk about them
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.360]   like they're commodities, things that they can get rid of
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.600]   when it's no longer convenient for them.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.920]   This is the kind of language we use very frequently.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.420]   What about attitudes towards Hong Kongers
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.500]   used towards our mainland brothers and sisters?
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.620]   Now I struggle with this.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.220]   When I see those tour groups getting off the bus,
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.060]   when I'm being crowded on the Star Ferry,
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.140]   when I'm just trying to relax or take in the views
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.940]   or enjoy the Star Ferry ride and there's like 500 people
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.700]   walking in at the same time, it's all loud and crazy,
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.220]   I admit that the feelings that come out in my heart,
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.940]   in my mind, are not very pleasant sometimes.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.000]   They're ugly and they're wrong.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.420]   I wrestle with this.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.440]   We need to do better than this, church, right?
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.580]   We need to do better than this.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.020]   We can do better than this.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.160]   Because if this is the way we talk,
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.080]   then how are we gonna relate to each other
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.440]   if this is the sort of like, in the back of our minds,
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.760]   this is the prejudice that we've already set up.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.400]   These are walls of hostility
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.160]   that we've already set up against other people.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.160]   So we need to do better.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.540]   This means watching your own language,
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.620]   being aware of the words that come out of your mouth.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.420]   This might even mean sticking out a little bit
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.120]   when you overhear conversations
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.300]   or when you're amongst your friends
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.100]   and they start throwing out those terms sort of freely.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.340]   We need to call it out for the sin it is
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.020]   and refuse to participate in it.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.400]   The point is this.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.180]   If the church is just a reflection
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.100]   of what our culture is like,
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.800]   especially when it comes to racial and cultural prejudice,
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.600]   then I would say it shows we haven't fully understood
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.560]   the message of the gospel even.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.840]   If we do not have unity that Jesus has called us to,
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.800]   then maybe we haven't fully embraced
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.260]   the power of the cross.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.920]   We fail to see God's heart.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.080]   His desire was to bring all people unity,
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.100]   to reconcile all people together.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.260]   Yes, Jesus died for your sins on the cross,
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.120]   so you could have a transforming, powerful, meaningful life,
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.040]   all that good stuff.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.900]   We know that.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.060]   But let me read verse 15 and 16 once again.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.220]   His purpose then was to create in himself
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.100]   one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:52.260]   And in one body to reconcile both of them to God
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.280]   through the cross by which he put to death
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.820]   their hostility, all hostility.
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.960]   So if we claim to love Jesus, we claim to love his word,
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.620]   we claim to love worshiping him,
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.580]   then we must take seriously the demands
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.940]   that he has called us to live in unity
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.860]   and in peace with each other.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.380]   This means we have work to do, church.
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.460]   We have to be serious about continuing
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.580]   to tear down the barriers, both seen and unseen,
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.980]   starting with this family right here,
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.000]   because that is exactly what Jesus has done.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.580]   And if we don't do that, or if we even worse,
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.260]   continue to put up walls,
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.420]   then we're literally trying to undo what God has done.
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.000]   It's literally swapping the truth of God's word for a lie.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.340]   It's rebelling against what God has, which is sin.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.100]   We don't wanna be a church, right,
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.300]   that says peace, peace, when there is no peace.
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.140]   Right, like I said, there's no conflict happening here,
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.460]   but peace isn't just the absence of conflict.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.080]   You can squash conflict in many different ways.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.720]   You could get an autocratic leader or someone like that
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.180]   to come and just dominate with his power.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.140]   Nobody's, everybody's too afraid to make a move, right?
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.120]   That could look like peace on the surface,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.640]   but that's not true peace.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:13.000]   Peace is where everybody can flourish.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Peace is when everybody can be what God created them to be,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.200]   regardless of age, gender, color, social status,
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.000]   whatever other barriers that we might have put up.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.240]   The point is this, Jesus longs for his church
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:32.960]   to overcome the cultural barriers of racism, nationalism,
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.560]   economic pride, and to embody a practical way
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.740]   which he created it to be,
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.040]   an attractive yet countercultural family of people
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.060]   very different from one another,
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.760]   but who love each other deeply
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.940]   and display the presence of God who is near.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:55.080]   The presence of God is best displayed in a church
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.560]   that is at true peace with each other,
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.220]   that has true unity with each other.
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.320]   We want this place to be a place
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.880]   where the presence of God is pleased to dwell.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.200]   That's the whole point of coming together as a church,
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.120]   isn't it?
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.360]   If the presence of God isn't here, then we're not a church.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.660]   The building, this isn't what makes the church.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.640]   The presence of God with us, that's what makes us a church.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.420]   And so if we're gathering without God's presence,
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.000]   we're not a church.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.700]   This is like a TED Talk every Sunday,
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.840]   motivational speaker, good band, okay, at best.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.080]   At worst, we're like a cult that gets together every Sunday.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:33.240]   That's not who we want to be.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.360]   We want to be a place where Jesus sits at the heart,
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.800]   at the foundation of everything that we do,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   because it's only through Jesus, Paul says,
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.440]   that the whole building is joined together.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.360]   In Christ, the whole building is joined together.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.600]   He becomes the dwelling place which God lives by his spirit.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.040]   This is the temple of the Lord.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.300]   And as we have said, when this happens,
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.260]   then there is true peace.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.360]   Then there is true unity, when there is reconciliation
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.220]   between all people.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.040]   So it's a big calling.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.980]   It's a big calling.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.120]   But we have to keep working at it.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.460]   And God knows this, right?
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.940]   It's going to be a journey.
[00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.160]   Because this is what Paul says.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.360]   In him, you too are being built together
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.160]   to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.040]   When he says being built, right,
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   this means it's a work in progress.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.000]   We are not gonna get perfect at this.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.660]   Jesus knows that.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.600]   But it reminds us that we need to keep going.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.440]   We need to be willing to do the hard work,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.560]   excuse me, to go through the process of continuing
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.360]   to figure out what it means to be built together.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.720]   This is an ongoing work and it's not going to end
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.620]   until Jesus returns again.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.960]   This isn't a project that we take on for a while
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.280]   and put on the back burner, right?
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.320]   It's, you know, Social Justice Awareness Week.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.680]   So we take on this work and then we put it
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   on the back burner again.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.400]   This is something we have to commit and promise each other
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.900]   that we're going to do.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.560]   Always to work on peace.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.160]   Always to seek unity.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.060]   Always to be reconcilers.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.680]   Because this is the type of community
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.360]   that God is delighted to dwell in.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.720]   In fact, I would say this is the kind of peace
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.860]   that the world needs to see.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:31.140]   This is how we become a reflection of what's in heaven
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.880]   as done on earth.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:39.440]   We can't just be a gathering of people if God is not here.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.560]   But it has to be done under the church.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.660]   The only way that we ever will see true peace in the world,
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.080]   again, this is why the church is so important.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.720]   The only thing that brings people together
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.920]   that will last forever, the only thing that everyone
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.800]   can be fully unified under is Jesus.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.680]   Because he is our source of life.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.240]   He is everyone's source of life.
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.080]   So church, let's build ourselves up.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.200]   Let's be that temple, let's be that space
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.280]   that God is pleased to dwell in
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.640]   where he sees his children gathering together
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.220]   no matter who they are and where they're from,
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.460]   breaking down these walls of hostility.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:24.460]   I'm gonna give you three tips, three action steps,
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.680]   three things you can take home and consider,
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.980]   practical things you can do to start doing this.
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.340]   These steps are taken from the Difference course.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.580]   And if you Google Difference course,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.740]   you'll find it's a fantastic resource
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.240]   to learn more about what peacemaking actually means.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.580]   So three things we can do.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.420]   Firstly, it's this, be curious.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.940]   Be curious.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.840]   This means listening to each other.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.320]   This means learning to see the world
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.240]   through other people's eyes.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.400]   Sitting down with someone that you're not familiar with,
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.360]   sitting down with someone who has a different background
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.180]   to you and hearing their story
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.760]   and allow them to hear yours as well.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.640]   Ask each other the questions.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.220]   The moment we get to know each other,
[00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.480]   so many barriers will naturally come down
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.180]   just as we get to know each other.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.200]   Be present.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.040]   Now don't just do it for the sake of doing it,
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.200]   but put your heart into it.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.340]   Be present with each other.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.280]   Meet each other with authenticity and confidence.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.660]   Stick up for each other when things come up.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.880]   Be advocates for each other.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.040]   Be present.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.360]   And finally, re-imagine.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.280]   This means that we have to have that faith,
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.920]   that hope that this work can be done.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.560]   The work of peace can be done,
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.360]   despite how bleak things look at times.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.760]   Be reassured that this is God's heart.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.840]   And if the Lord desires to see this happen,
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.940]   then nothing can stop it from happening.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.300]   And of course, finally, we have to pray.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.480]   We have to pray.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.660]   We pray because the enemy hates unity.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.000]   Well, this whole mess with sin
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.400]   started when the enemy tried to put distance,
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.480]   successfully, between humans and God.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.120]   Right, this is why Paul tells us,
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.760]   later in Ephesians,
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.740]   do not give the devil any space to work in this.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.200]   We have to keep working on our unity.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.360]   Don't let the sun go down
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.160]   while you're angry with your brother and sister.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.560]   This is how the devil gets a foothold.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.120]   In other words, all the barriers that we have put up,
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.100]   all the barriers that have been threatened to put up,
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.160]   we need to deal with, and we need to deal with it now.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.140]   And so, church, we must pray.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.300]   The task is large,
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.760]   and it's gonna take everybody working together
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.460]   to put effort into this.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:46.640]   But know that as we do this,
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.800]   this is what pleases God's heart.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   This is the kind of church that God wants to see.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.040]   This is what the church is called to be.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.080]   This is what the world needs to see in answer
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.520]   to the fighting and the violence
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.160]   and the wars that are going on out there,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.800]   that if we're unified under the one true God,
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.280]   under the source of all life,
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.160]   we can truly have peace,
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.360]   no matter who we are, where we come from.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.560]   We can truly be that place where we live
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.220]   without any barriers, without any prejudice,
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.760]   where we come together, get to know each other,
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.640]   because that's how God has drawn us together under his name.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.920]   You have been called to be a peacemaker.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.620]   So, church, let's go and make peace in the name of Jesus.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.680]   Would you pray with me?
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.840]   [silence]
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:50.680]   Yeah, Lord, we just,
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:56.440]   yeah, we acknowledge that this is a great challenge
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.480]   that you set for us,
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.880]   and there's a lot of homework we can do on this,
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.520]   a lot of ways we can reflect on
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.900]   how we've participated in this,
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.660]   the own barriers that we've put up in our own hearts.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:12.080]   Even within this body,
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.480]   perhaps there's some of us who have felt judged
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.240]   and mistreated,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.440]   discriminated against.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:30.080]   If that's where we've been, if that's our story,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.480]   we pray for comfort,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.880]   and we pray for the truth to speak louder than the lies,
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.240]   to say that God loves you and recognizes you
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.040]   and welcomes you, no matter what other people have said.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:46.760]   And for all of us, we need to look at the prejudices
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.200]   that we hold in our own hearts,
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.360]   to see the ways we've put up walls and barriers
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.960]   that might have stopped people from entering
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.480]   into knowing who you are,
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.880]   where we haven't been a reflection of your love.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.960]   Jesus, in those ways, work in our hearts,
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.880]   help us to understand the other,
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.360]   people who are different to us.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:13.620]   And culturally, yes, it's a cultural, it's a race thing,
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.840]   but also through the generations,
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.020]   through class and socioeconomic barriers,
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.680]   through gender barriers,
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.180]   through sexual orientation barriers,
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.920]   through social status barriers, whatever it may be, Lord,
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.760]   you have come so we can have true peace and unity
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.240]   under your name.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.080]   So help us be a church that reflects that.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.880]   Help us be a church that always prays for your peace,
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.240]   for true peace and true unity,
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.040]   so that we can demonstrate to the world
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.280]   that when we come under the all-powerful,
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.840]   almighty, all-loving name of Jesus,
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.360]   he creates us to be something more beautiful,
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.400]   a new humanity where we can all live and thrive
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.600]   and be who God has called us to be,
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.960]   the unique gifts that you've given everybody,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.880]   where we can truly fit together as one body
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.920]   and function for the glory of the name of Jesus.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:19.220]   So keep working in us, Lord, and keep us near to you,
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.260]   keep us near to each other.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.820]   Grant us your peace, we pray, in Jesus' name.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.300]   Amen.
