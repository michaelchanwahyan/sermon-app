1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
 Amen. Thank you, Chapman. Let's give it up for Chapman.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:14,000
 Well, in 2022 on Vision Sunday, Pastor Ivan and I, together with Pastor Andrew, we announced

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,440
 that we are planting a church with an English and a Cantonese service.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,320
 Now, we did that during a time when there was still COVID restrictions, so we had to do it on

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,920
 a live stream, so we did it on camera. And it was actually a funny story, because Pastor Ivan,

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,960
 we were experimenting with, what do you call that thing?

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,680
 The teleprompter. But then right when he was going to use it, it failed.

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,320
 But he was prepared anyhow, so it was no problem. So there's a lot of behind the

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:58,720
 scene sort of stuff that happened. But besides that, we also mentioned on that Sunday

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,280
 that we did not know where we were going to plant the church. So we said we had six

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,880
 criteria that we're looking for and with which we're going to search. And hopefully,

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,080
 that year we had Vision Sunday Part 1 and Part 2, hopefully on Vision Sunday Part 2,

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
 we will be able to tell the church where we're actually planting the church.

14
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,920
 Now, I just want you to sit in that a little bit, that you're going in front of a group of people

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,120
 and you're saying you're going to do something, but you don't know where you're going to do it.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,600
 And then also, you're doing it on camera, so at that point in time, you can't even physically

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,360
 gather with each other. So there was a statement of an act of faith and of courage

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,360
 that we did that. And there was another part of it. It was part of our vision,

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,280
 because we had what's called a river model vision, where there's this image of a river

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,240
 flowing all over across Hong Kong with all the secondary rivers and little creeks.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,440
 And that God wants us, instead of focusing on building one big church,

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,520
 he wants the river to flow throughout Hong Kong, watering thirsty land. And he wants to form new

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,360
 and different types of communities, fresh expressions throughout the land to love,

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,720
 to serve, to share the gospel for his kingdom. And we also said this is greater than the wine church.

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,320
 This is not just wine church. We're not trying to build empire. We really just want to be obedient

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:48,960
 to God and share the gospel and do his work. Now, all of this, during this time, there was also a

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:59,280
 sense that we had as a leadership that this was a prophetic act. That while other companies were

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,600
 pulling out of Hong Kong, their investments, they were shifting to regional headquarters like

29
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:14,720
 Singapore and other Asian hub cities. We felt that God was asking us to double down on investing in

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,000
 Hong Kong. There was the sense that God was saying to us, I'm not finished with Hong Kong.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 But the reality was at the time, there was quite a few people, not everyone,

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,960
 but it was quite a few people who at that time felt that way. It was just a very difficult season.

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,000
 And so this was an act of faith and of stepping out and then doing what God asked us to do.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,200
 Now, we did not do this on our own. You can't plant a church on your own.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
 Otherwise, it'd just be Ivan and I hanging out, having a beer probably, or actually wine.

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:00,320
 Truth be told, it'd be wine. It wouldn't be beer. But there was others involved in that. And so I

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,560
 actually want to ask those of you who were part of the launch team that met and went shy to stand up.

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:22,240
 So you see there's a few people here that were part of that. You can sit down. Thank you so

39
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:33,440
 much for doing that, for humoring me. So this was a group of brave people who responded not to Ivan

40
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,280
 and I really, but what God was saying to them and how God was moving and stirring in their hearts.

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,160
 And he said, yes, I want to be part of that. I can see what God wants to do. And so I'm going to

42
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,800
 step out in faith. I'm going to take this risk because it's risky to go out, to leave your

43
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,240
 comfort. Man, the Vine Church and Wine Shy is home. It's been a place of healing for many of us

44
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,280
 and a place of friendship and a place, I know for my wife, it's the only place besides here

45
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,360
 now that she's ever been part of a church. And so this was leaving home. But everyone stepped out

46
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,880
 because they were moved and touched by the Holy Spirit to do so. And I do want to acknowledge

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,120
 that subsequently there's been people stepping out in faith and joining us in what we're doing.

48
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,160
 There's a lot of faith and going back to church, if you haven't been in church in a while,

49
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,920
 there's a lot of faith and making your gifts and talents available as you join us and helping us

50
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,000
 carry out this mission and this work that God has given us.

51
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,840
 But what I wanted us to see is it's amazing when we're willing to get out of our comfort zone

52
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,920
 what God can do. When we make ourselves available to him and Margaret Mead, she was an American

53
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,680
 cultural anthropologist and a speaker and author, also an Anglican Christian, she said this,

54
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,000
 "Never doubt a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,320
 that ever has." So it always takes people to step out and take that first step into,

56
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,160
 you know, this new thing that God is doing. And so it's amazing what God has done. And I hope

57
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,040
 you've been amazed. I know Ivan and I are. And we're just blown away by the work of God, the

58
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:42,880
 work of the Spirit here in this community. And it's this what we are sensing and are being called

59
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,960
 to this year again. God is calling us out of our comfort zone into uncharted waters because of the

60
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,520
 kingdom impact it will have on Hong Kong and because of discipleship impact it will have on us.

61
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:08,240
 Now along with this word of uncharted waters that God has given us, there was also a prophetic

62
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,000
 image that was shared. This is Pastor Andrew shared this with the church leadership.

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:23,280
 The church leadership discerned and approved that yes, this is a word not just for Wan Chai,

64
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,640
 but it's also a word for Wan Chai, but also a word for Yuen Long as well. And after all,

65
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:38,400
 we are one church in two locations, right? And so this image is of a boat of kind of during like

66
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,720
 earlier days when there was uncharted waters, when you didn't know what lies in that direction if you

67
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,400
 just sail out straight. And so there's this image of a boat heading out and there's an excitement

68
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:03,200
 among the crew that is heading out on this boat. There's an anticipation and an expectation of

69
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,960
 what's to come. There's a captain standing at the bow and peering at the horizon, you know,

70
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,280
 to wondering what were we going to discover? What are we going to find? And the crew is using their

71
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,840
 gifts and talents working together to, because that's the only way it works on these adventures.

72
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,880
 Excuse me.

73
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:45,520
 My apologies. And so the image, but there's also besides a sense of excitement,

74
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,520
 there's also some fear and some anxiety because going in the uncharted waters,

75
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,040
 you know, it's uncomfortable and we don't know what's going to happen. And there's a sense

76
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,240
 of that resilience and courage, you know, we'll be needed flexibility to make adjustments as we go.

77
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,560
 And so this was this image that God gave us for this year. Now, this is not a new vision in terms

78
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,360
 of what we're doing as a church. We still have our river model vision and a growing big people

79
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:26,800
 vision that we are pursuing together. But now, but this is what God, we sense God inviting us

80
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,800
 into stepping in these uncharted waters and this uncharted territory. Now, I know that many of you

81
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,160
 feel like, man, Tim, we just got settled here. We just, we already did the uncharted thing. We

82
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,600
 already went out. Come on. What are you talking about? You know, and we understand that. And

83
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,560
 it's been amazing, you know, that we made ourselves available. We went and we've experienced what God

84
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:59,920
 has done. But we sense that last year was a bit of a time of also arresting, you know, of that

85
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,440
 intimacy. We also talked about, there was a lot of healing. You know, we had the sermons, he's

86
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,400
 longing for healing. We felt that God was doing healing work. And so, but now he's inviting us

87
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:22,000
 to set out again as a boat together. And we didn't plant this church to stay in the harbor.

88
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,400
 You know, we plant this church to set out into the community, into the businesses,

89
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:38,880
 into your families, into your neighborhoods. And then as we're sailing out, we believe

90
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:47,040
 that there will be discoveries of the work of God is doing that he wants us to say yes to,

91
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,240
 to give ourselves to, you know, to these things that God is doing,

92
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,840
 where the spirit of God is moving. And then when we, when you see God work, when he invites you

93
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,160
 in something, it does take that decisive response. You know, you cannot say, "Oh yeah, okay,

94
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:14,400
 maybe later." No, if God is moving here, this is like a Kairos moment. Like it's an opportune

95
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,760
 time. We need to respond now. We need to give ourselves to it now. And there's things we're

96
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,160
 just not going to discover when we just stay here in the harbor. So we have to set out.

97
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:34,000
 And I'm excited about that and excited to see, you know, what God is going to open up for us

98
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,080
 as we head out together in this community, in our workplaces, and what opportunities he's

99
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,000
 going to give us to give ourselves to, to be part of the work that he is doing of bringing

100
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,400
 his kingdom more fully on this earth. Now, let me take you to Matthew 13,

101
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,160
 quite well-known parables. Starting with verse 44, it says this,

102
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:08,240
 "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again.

103
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,520
 And then in his joy, he went out and he sold all he had and bought that field."

104
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:21,360
 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of

105
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,240
 great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. Now, the first parable

106
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:37,840
 suggests that the kingdom is something that we stumble across. The worker of the field,

107
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,880
 he was not like a treasure seeker with one of those metal detectors.

108
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,000
 He was actually just trying to earn his day's wage. And as he was going about his work,

109
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,080
 suddenly he discovered his treasure.

110
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:59,920
 So that's how in the first parable the kingdom comes upon that person.

111
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,040
 And then in the second parable, it suggests that the kingdom is encountered

112
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,760
 because there are expected surprises. So this is somebody who's intentionally seeking. He's

113
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,920
 seeking for great pearls. It's a merchant. He knows what a good pearl looks like,

114
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:27,120
 but he has to wait until one comes. And as he sees the great one, then he knows what he's seeing,

115
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,840
 and then he goes for it. So the kingdom of God comes, we stumble across it, but we also

116
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,200
 seek it out and then discover it because we're seeking it. So I think that's important for us

117
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:49,440
 in the season. So both parables, they also make the point that this is an opportunity and actually

118
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,640
 also requires us to respond decisively when we come across the kingdom, when we find that treasure,

119
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:05,680
 when we find that pearl of great value. And one thing that stood out to me

120
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:13,440
 was in the first parable, it talks about that there is great joy of the discovery.

121
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,200
 And I think that's important for us because there is a great sacrifice. He sells everything that he

122
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,000
 has. The merchant sells everything that he has. By the way, the day laborer was not a particular

123
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:37,040
 wealthy man. He was actually probably a person with not very many resources. And the merchant

124
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,600
 was probably a wealthy man, a businessman. But when he came across the opportunities,

125
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:50,560
 they had to give their all to respond to it, to have it, to be part, to experience this great joy

126
00:14:50,560 --> 00:15:00,320
 and to really receive it. And so the price is high. It's not an easy, "Oh yeah, maybe I'll sell

127
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:10,560
 piano that I don't like, but I'll keep the stamp that I really like. I'm not going to let go of

128
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,480
 this. I'm going to hold on to my Pokemon card collection and I'll let go of something." No,

129
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:25,200
 it requires a full response, a full giving of ourselves in order to be part of what God is doing.

130
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:34,320
 And so there's a real cost, there's a real risk and chance taking in responding to the kingdom

131
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,000
 when God's reign and the work of God breaks upon us. The same is true for us.

132
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,160
 I mean, we enter the kingdom, of course, when you come to faith, so there's a radical response

133
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,240
 because it means you're giving up your lordship. Instead of being lord of your own life, right?

134
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,960
 Your Jesus becomes your Lord. So there's a significant shift in that. But then at later

135
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,640
 times, when the kingdom of God breaks into our lives, it still calls for a radical response.

136
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,560
 And like with the person who found a treasure in the field and the merchant who found this

137
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,000
 incredible pearl, they saw something that other people didn't see. They saw something of tremendous

138
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,480
 and incredible value. We could say they saw a better possible future. They saw this incredible

139
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,920
 thing that God was doing. They're like, "I'm going to give myself to that. I want to be part of that.

140
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,800
 I believe in this. I want to see this happening." And in order to be part of it and for this to be

141
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,920
 realized, we have to give ourselves to what God is doing. And there's a sacrifice in that. And

142
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,280
 that's how these things that God is doing, how he allows us to be part of what he's bringing about.

143
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,640
 And so in this season, there is great joy when we're going to stumble across these things

144
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,600
 of the kingdom that God is doing. And there's also going to be great joy because we're seeking it out

145
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,840
 and we see, "Wow, God is moving here. And I want to be part of what God is doing there."

146
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,440
 And I think that's important because sometimes I feel like in church,

147
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,360
 it's like we're dreading, "Oh, we're being asked to sacrifice." And I don't know if I want to

148
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,640
 sacrifice. And I think the important part is God first shows you this amazing thing that he's doing.

149
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,800
 And there's great joy. There's something within us. We're like, "Yes, I want to be part of that.

150
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,360
 I want to see this thing happen." And that allows us to make the sacrifice because we see the beauty

151
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:03,360
 of the work of God. And so there's this parable that kind of gives us a picture of how we need

152
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,040
 to enter and move into these uncharted waters. It's a season where we'll need to be both

153
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:20,000
 intentional seeking out the kingdom, but we need to also be ready to respond to these unexpected

154
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,480
 moves of God that we stumble across when they happen so we can say yes to them.

155
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,200
 And like these parables show, it takes decisive action. It doesn't just happen.

156
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:41,200
 Now, the Divine Church has a bold organizational practice. So we meet twice a month as a staff

157
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,120
 from One Shining Long together. And one of the things that people can do in the quarters,

158
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,960
 they can ask any question anonymously. Now, anonymously is always, you just don't know what

159
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
 you're going to get, right? And there are tough questions, but it is really a way of opening a

160
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,160
 channel for truthful communication. And so early on in the church plan, one of the questions that

161
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:12,000
 was asked was, "What if the church plan fails?" And so then the question was given to me and

162
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,080
 then later to Ivan to address. And it was interesting because I was worried about things.

163
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,080
 I was worried, will we have enough people for a launch team? Will we figure out the location?

164
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,720
 So there was questions I was wondering about, but I didn't think of this church plan in terms of

165
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,360
 success and failure. But I'm glad the person asked the question because, you know, as we had a chance

166
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,880
 to think about it a little bit and then respond, it was really clear to me that, you know, God had

167
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,200
 moved. He had given us this envision. He had invited us into this work. And for me, failure

168
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,640
 would be not to respond to this thing that God is inviting us to do. You know, for me, failure

169
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:04,480
 would be not to invest in the kingdom of God. And that would be failure. And so

170
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:13,600
 for me to fail is if the vine would never seek to plant a church,

171
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,600
 reach the loss for the gospel of peace and hope, or serve the vulnerable and marginalized.

172
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,120
 You know, for churches that just always play it safe, that never go for it,

173
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,920
 you know, we're missing out on what God wants to do. And so he gave us, he had us see this treasure,

174
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,800
 but then we had to give ourselves towards it to make it happen. And then whatever happens is up

175
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:46,800
 to him. We just need to be faithful in responding to what he asks us to do. And so this is what God

176
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:55,680
 is inviting us into. Now I'm excited to invite up Ivan. He's going to share with you something

177
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,520
 that we're sensing. So we have this theme of uncharted, and he's going to share with you a

178
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,760
 little bit, some of the things that are in his art. So Ivan, why don't you come up here? Let's

179
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:15,920
 welcome Ivan. Thank you, Pastor Tim. Yeah. Let me share with you about a group of people in Hong

180
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:24,640
 Kong that lead us to take risks for. A group of people that are well setting out for into uncharted

181
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:33,520
 waters because the cost of staying in the harbor is too great. I would like to share a very

182
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:40,880
 interesting research about recent religions trends in Hong Kong. We can show the slide. A

183
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:50,720
 2023 Peel Research Center, the report showed that there are raised in religions. It showed

184
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:59,680
 that this affiliation in a widespread trend in Hong Kong. You can see that we have 37% of people

185
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:07,920
 reporting they were raised in a religion, but have left their childhood faith, which is the highest

186
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:18,480
 number in the whole Asia. More over, 30% of people, the report that they were raised without

187
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:28,800
 a religion, while 61% currently identify as religiously unaffiliated. This is representing

188
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:38,320
 a 31% of gain in people with no religion affiliation. The percentage of religiously

189
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,880
 unaffiliated grows even more dramatically among young adults aged 18 to 34. You can see the

190
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:56,720
 number. 74% they show that they are religiously unaffiliated. They are labeled as nones.

191
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,720
 That means they are loving in their religions. They are loving their low relationship with God,

192
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:12,720
 any God. This is a percentage showing that it is interesting enough to reflect the phenomenon

193
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,160
 with we have observed in the majority of local churches in Hong Kong nowadays, especially for

194
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:29,280
 this group of age, younger generation. People have not only left the church, but also abandoned

195
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,040
 their faith. This group of young generation, they not only just left their church,

196
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:42,000
 stay in the church themselves, the faith themselves, but they left their faith.

197
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,480
 This is clearly a serious and critical situation for our younger generation.

198
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,880
 God led us to plan a church in Yuen Long two years ago. According to government data,

199
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:02,800
 Yuen Long district is proceeded for continued growth, driven by new town development and

200
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:14,000
 strategic urban planning. The population of Yuen Long in 2030 is projected to be 700,000.

201
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,920
 700,000. Can you imagine that? 700,000 people in Yuen Long district.

202
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:31,920
 With over 20%, which means more than 140,000 being young adult age 18 to 34. Tim and I and

203
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,400
 Chapman, we are not in this group, so we can proudly say that they are young generation.

204
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,200
 I saw that there's a lot of young generation among us as well.

205
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:51,280
 This demographic is a critical component of this growth. With chance, I indicated a preference for

206
00:24:51,280 --> 00:25:00,560
 newer residential areas, offering more than amenities and affordability. Projections suggest

207
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:07,040
 that this district, Yuen Long district, will continue to attract younger family and professionals.

208
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,120
 So maybe some of you may live in other districts before, but you just moved to this district

209
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,600
 because of different reasons. But we can see that more and more young families and also young

210
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,120
 professionals will come to this district. We hope that we can really serve them.

211
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,800
 But where is this young people spiritually?

212
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,840
 They are the missing piece of the church in Hong Kong nowadays.

213
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,160
 They are the future of this city, but they cannot see the kingdom of God.

214
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:57,120
 They live at home, a spiritual home like us. What I want to emphasize is that we are in the best

215
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:06,000
 place, the best location, the best timing, the best moment to serve this group of younger generation.

216
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,200
 A spoken person from one of the biggest Hong Kong local research centers told me that

217
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,000
 through their research, they found that the main reason why the younger generation left church

218
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:30,800
 is not about the context inside the church. It's not about the political stance. It's not about

219
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:39,200
 leadership issues. This younger generation left church is primarily because they couldn't see

220
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:48,160
 church making positive impact on this city. They couldn't see that this church, that religion,

221
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,800
 as related to their lives. They couldn't see that the value of the church.

222
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:08,160
 So, church, this is time. This is the time for us as a church to humbly kneel before God,

223
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:15,520
 to step up for our next generation, the younger generation, to let God be God of this city

224
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:25,920
 and his people, to lift up our voices and give up our own desires, to set ourselves aside for God

225
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:35,200
 and sacrifice all we have for his kingdom. This is a time for all people to praise and return

226
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,960
 the glory to God because God himself deserves all the glory. Amen.

227
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,200
 There is a picture, that picture that totally facilitated me.

228
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:54,880
 Imagine there is a church fully and faithfully investing in a group of younger people,

229
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:06,080
 loving them, caring them, encouraging them, empowering them, discipling them, and also

230
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,040
 walk with them for all this, their journey to grow together. Imagine in the coming 20 years,

231
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:20,160
 there are 200 and 300 and 200 young people who have grown as big people.

232
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:27,680
 These people faithfully love their family. They wholeheartedly to serve the church and they

233
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:37,200
 impactfully, spiritually to impact this city. I believe that this city will definitely change

234
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:46,800
 with this group of people. They have been discipled. Amen. Amen. So as a church like us,

235
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,400
 in this critical place, critical moment in Hong Kong, in this city, what shall we do?

236
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:02,560
 What shall we do this year? It doesn't mean that we need to serve like 140,000 people,

237
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,520
 but we believe that God has given us a specific calling to work for his kingdom.

238
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:17,520
 So let's welcome back Pastor Tim to share what is in our heart, what God put in our heart.

239
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,200
 Thank you, Ivan. Brilliant. Yeah, let's give him a hand.

240
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,360
 [Applause]

241
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:33,200
 Now, what might these uncharted waters look like for us? Well, the one thing that Ivan and I,

242
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,680
 and we did wrestle with this prayerfully for a very long time, but the one thing that we both,

243
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:44,640
 our spirits both jumped, you know, is this young adults peace, where we just really sense God's

244
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,040
 heart for the young adults of the city and that we as a church need to step out, get uncomfortable

245
00:29:51,040 --> 00:30:03,680
 and do something. And so in 2025, our heart is to plant a third Sunday service that is built on the

246
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:10,000
 foundation of young people. So we want to get young, this young generation together,

247
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:19,840
 and then from there launch a third service. And so we sense a strong call to invest

248
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:27,280
 in this next generation. Somebody has to do it. And we think we're positioned to do it.

249
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:36,080
 Now, going into uncharted territories, you know, it's not comfortable, it's not easy. It means

250
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,800
 getting out of our comfort zone. Like Ivan shared, there's, you know, the generation,

251
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:48,160
 a lot of the people in the generation feel like that. Like church doesn't matter. They don't see

252
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,920
 the relevance of faith and of God and of Jesus, you know, for their own lives and for the city.

253
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:02,000
 And so they just set it aside. And so our challenge is to find ways of showing and modeling,

254
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,960
 you know, that Jesus and following him and living for him, you know, is worth it.

255
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:18,000
 You know, that he does have an identity, a purpose for their lives, and that it is beautiful and

256
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,080
 exciting and it is something worth giving themselves to. But for every generation,

257
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,800
 you have to find new ways of sharing this good news and of communicating this truth.

258
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,120
 And so there's going to be some effort and some energy and some getting uncomfortable

259
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:43,920
 that will be needed for this uncharted work. But as I was preparing this, I just really had to sense,

260
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:51,360
 you know, someone got out of their comfort zone and got uncomfortable for your sake,

261
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,040
 to share the gospel with you. You know, somebody got uncomfortable for you.

262
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:05,120
 And so I just wondered, church, are we going to be willing to be uncomfortable to share this

263
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,800
 beautiful gospel message? It's good news, right? Are we going to be willing to be uncomfortable

264
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:17,040
 to share this good news with a generation that where many of them right now are nuns?

265
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,280
 They just don't want to affiliate with anything religious, let alone Jesus, Christianity.

266
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,760
 So I think it's time for us to get uncomfortable, to go out. Doesn't mean we have the answers of

267
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,640
 how to do all of this or how to do everything, but there's this call for us to go out.

268
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:44,320
 Now, how will we do it and what will also this third service look like? Well, in some sense,

269
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,600
 we don't know. We're called Season Uncharted. We have this one piece, young adults, third service,

270
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,760
 but how we're going to get there, we don't know. And we actually wanted to also be careful not to

271
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,800
 put out strategies and plans. And I mean, we were involved in planting this church,

272
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:10,400
 so we have some ideas of what this could be like. But we felt that we needed to be careful

273
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,880
 and just hold our ideas loosely and just really be open for these things that God opens up.

274
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,680
 So we can say yes to them and follow the Holy Spirit's leading and not the old paths and the

275
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,080
 old ways, which maybe that's what God leads us on. But we go there because God leads us on,

276
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:38,080
 not because that's where past success was. So church, I'm so excited to step with you guys

277
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,040
 into this uncharted season. I do want to share a little bit of what we can picture. We do picture,

278
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,320
 obviously, if you're a young adult here, we want to talk to you and hear what is on your heart

279
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:58,960
 regarding your generation. We want to just hear what excites you about this vision.

280
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,920
 We can imagine getting you together like a young adults community, Sunday afternoons,

281
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,520
 or something like that. We can imagine running a young adults alpha that's specifically geared

282
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,480
 towards you. And so there's many things that we can imagine, but the only thing that's clear is

283
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,240
 young adults, third service, and then talking to you. So that's the starting point. And then

284
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:34,320
 we'll take it from there. Now, while that really is our big focus, in addition to that, I do want

285
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,040
 to say that I believe that God will open up some opportunities this year as well that we cannot

286
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,880
 plan for, that we could not even know, but that he wants us to respond to. Maybe it's a third,

287
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,160
 maybe it's another mission partner, an organization that we partner with and that we do incredible

288
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:57,440
 kingdom work in the city with. And so we also just want to be ready for that as well. I just

289
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:08,720
 wanted to mention that. Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up. So as we step into this

290
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,880
 uncharted season, there's going to be things that we do not know yet about that God wants to do in

291
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,760
 and through us. But these things are only going to happen if we are willing to go out, if we're

292
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,120
 willing to sail out on the boat in the uncharted waters. For me, it would be a pity if at the end

293
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:43,520
 of the year, we all never were uncomfortable for the kingdom's sake. You know, my heart is that

294
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,760
 we're willing to risk, to give God our all, you know, to make ourselves available to him for the

295
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,280
 things that he has for us. Now, this is not a time in Hong Kong's history for the church to be

296
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,880
 comfortable. There are so many young people who need to be impacted for the sake of the gospel.

297
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,640
 And if the church remains in this place of comfort, this will not happen. Come on, church.

298
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:19,280
 Let's do this, right? Yes. Now, because this is a time of calling us in the uncharted waters and

299
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,800
 being uncomfortable, I'm going to do something that is a little bit uncomfortable for me,

300
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:31,280
 but I'm going to do it anyhow, which is, you know, today is Vision Sunday. So we do ask that you give

301
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:38,480
 in response to this vision, to this thing that God has revealed to us, you know, for this year.

302
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:47,280
 And there is also a decisiveness that is needed in that. So I want to invite you to prayerfully

303
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,600
 consider what God might be inviting you to give right now. You're giving as an investment

304
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,000
 in the future of Hong Kong and the future generation of Hong Kong.

305
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,600
 You're giving today will allow us to respond to the moves of God. Because like we said,

306
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,920
 we don't know when this discovery is made. Sometimes we stumble across it. Sometimes we

307
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,680
 find it because we're seeking it out. But when we do, we want to be able to respond and give

308
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,600
 ourselves fully to it. And so one way that we're able to do that is also through finances,

309
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,080
 you know, that we can respond to the things that we come across. So we want to invite you to give.

310
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:34,240
 We're asking you today to give above and beyond your normal ties,

311
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,480
 to give towards this vision. So we're inviting you now to make an investment in the city

312
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,880
 that you love, that you are planted in through the church that you are in.

313
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,320
 And every amount that you give today, it counts. You know, it matters. And the beauty of it is,

314
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:03,040
 is that we get to do this together as a family. We all get to get behind this vision together.

315
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,920
 So I invite you right now to give. I'm going to say a prayer and then Chapman's going to come up.

316
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,440
 He's going to share a few more words after that. So let me pray for us, church. Why don't we stand up?

317
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,200
 Jesus, we thank you so much

318
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:37,840
 that you love every single person here in the city, that you long for them to know you.

319
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:44,000
 Jesus, we thank you how you've been so faithful to us, how you've brought us here and all this

320
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,920
 amazing work that you've done. And we give you praise. Lord, I pray that you give us courage

321
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,280
 to respond to the moves of your spirit, this courage to get out of our comfort zones.

322
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:08,000
 Then as your kingdom breaks in, as your reign reveals itself, as what you're doing becomes

323
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 clear, Lord, I pray that you stir excitement in our heart where we can see, wow, that is beautiful.

324
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,640
 I can see this better future. I want to be part of it. Lord, I pray that you give us courage to

325
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:30,320
 give ourselves to this work that you're doing throughout all of our being, through our serving,

326
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:39,200
 through our giving. And Lord, may you use it for your glory. May you be honored this year by us,

327
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,760
 your church. And so we thank you that you speak to us. We thank you for this journey that we're

328
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,080
 I'm with you and I pray this in your name, Jesus.

329
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,920
 Amen.
