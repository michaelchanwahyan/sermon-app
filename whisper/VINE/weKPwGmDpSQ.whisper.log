[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   - Amen, amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   Can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.760]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.600]   So blessed.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.680]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.880]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.680]   Welcome if you're joining us online right now
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.800]   from wherever you are around the world.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.560]   We are so glad that you are here present with us
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.240]   in this place and in this moment.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.960]   And we're grateful for each one of you.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.080]   Jump on the chat if you can, and Facebook particularly,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.520]   and just let us know where you're from, what you're doing.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.360]   Well, hopefully what you're doing
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.480]   is joining us in the service,
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.480]   but you can tell us where you're from, that'd be great.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.160]   And welcome to everyone in this room.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.840]   It's so great to have you guys with us.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.920]   If you're new to the Vine,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.720]   if this is a relatively new experience for you,
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.040]   my name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.040]   Maybe you've been invited here by a friend
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.120]   who's dragged you along.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.880]   Maybe you were supposed to go to the Baptist church
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.080]   next door, but you're here.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.440]   That's great.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.880]   We're so glad you are.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.280]   We're starting a new series today,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.440]   a short little four-week punchy series
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.160]   called "From the Heart."
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160]   And there was something that was on my heart
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.720]   as we came out of our "A Different Spirit" series,
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.320]   which was a seven-week series we've just finished
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.600]   on Numbers 13 and 14.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.920]   It's all online, you can jump on
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.840]   and take a look at that if you're new with us.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.400]   But we just did this big series looking at
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.960]   what it is to carry a different spirit in Hong Kong
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600]   in this season, in this hour,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.000]   what the Holy Spirit might be saying to us as individuals,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.160]   as church in the city today.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.520]   And that was great.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.360]   And we got to the end of that,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000]   and I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.880]   if we could just hear from some of the senior leaders
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.920]   in our church, those that have been leaders in the past,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.680]   historically with us, some of those that are leaders
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.160]   with us right in this moment,
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.000]   and ask them a simple question.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.560]   What is on your heart for the vine in this moment,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.240]   in this season?
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.400]   I said to each one of them,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.600]   how would you bring expression to this idea
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.440]   of a different spirit?
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.240]   What do you think a different spirit means
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.760]   for the vine in this time, in this hour?
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.920]   And so this series really is just a series of people
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.320]   that are gonna come and do that and bring their hearts.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.280]   You'll see here the rundown.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.600]   I'm gonna speak to you guys today.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.640]   We got Tony Reid coming on the 27th of June,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.280]   just after World Refugee Day next Sunday.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.640]   Then Tony will be with us, one of our founding pastors here.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880]   Sydney Yip, chairman of our eldership
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.280]   who's sitting over here right now.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040]   Sydney's gonna come and bring a message on the 4th of July,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.680]   and on the 11th of July, we'll finish with John,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.160]   John Snellgrove, one of our founding pastors as well.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.840]   And I know that these men are gonna bring something
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.240]   in their spirit for you,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.080]   and I wanna encourage you right at the start,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.080]   just to open yourself up, like we were just seeing.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400]   I am open.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.800]   Are we really open to hear
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.480]   what the Spirit is saying to the church?
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.600]   And I think over these weeks in this series,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.560]   we're gonna hear a little bit about that.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.440]   And I'm excited I get to kick it off today
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.800]   and share with you a message that really has been formating
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.880]   and kind of bubbling away on my spirit for about a year now.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.720]   And I've been wondering,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.680]   when am I gonna be able to bring it?
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.520]   When am I gonna be able to say it?
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.440]   When is the timing right?
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.640]   And I think this series is the perfect time for it.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.240]   It's a pastoral word for you.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.480]   I hope it's an encouraging, inspiring word,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.800]   a challenging word perhaps,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.880]   but something that I believe will help shape
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.360]   and grow your relationship with Jesus in this moment.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.120]   Because we've been saying throughout the last
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.440]   sort of eight weeks, nine weeks
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.560]   that we've been reopened as a church,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.120]   we've been saying that it's our time to lean in
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.920]   to what the Holy Spirit is doing in our lives,
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.200]   together, personally,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.840]   as we see what God wants to do in our city.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.440]   And I think this and what I wanna share today
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.520]   is part of that process for you.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.200]   Let me start by just asking us a simple question.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.600]   It's this, have you ever been frustrated
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.560]   that God doesn't seem to be moving fast enough in your life?
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.120]   You ever been frustrated by that?
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.360]   Like, it seems like God's on a different timetable
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.040]   to your timetable.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   Like, God hasn't come through with that healing
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.040]   or that answered prayer,
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.000]   or he hasn't spoken to you as quickly as you think he should
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.040]   or as quickly as would be right for you.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.760]   Anyone felt that way?
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.960]   Have you ever felt like you're in Causeway Bay
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.720]   on a Saturday and it's packed full of people?
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.080]   And like you're walking there
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.720]   and you're trying to get from A to B
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.640]   and you've got a destination to get to,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.920]   but it's so packed, you can't move around much.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.040]   And the person standing and walking right in front of you
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.520]   is the slowest walking person in Hong Kong.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.120]   Have you ever experienced that?
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.800]   Like, and you know, you're just like, this is ridiculous.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.040]   Why does this person have no purpose in life?
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.120]   Like, don't they have somewhere to go, something to do?
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.400]   And you wanted to slap them on the back of the head,
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.880]   you know, walk faster.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   You know, this is Causeway Bay, come on.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.920]   We follow Jesus, don't we?
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.080]   And sometimes it feels a little bit like Jesus
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.200]   is in front of us and we wanna kind of slap him
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.040]   on the back of the head.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.440]   Like, come on, Jesus.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.160]   It's time that you move a bit quicker.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.120]   You know, we got a purpose here, we're doing something.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.920]   You've spoken some dreams into my heart.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.320]   You've got a word for me.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.240]   I know there are big things in my life that you wanna do.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.280]   And it seems like we're at a red light.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.520]   What are you doing, Jesus?
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.800]   Israel, in their history with God,
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   felt like this so many times.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.880]   The Old Testament is filled with stories
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.720]   where Israel is wondering why God is so slow.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.600]   There's a great moment right at the end of the Old Testament
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.160]   where Israel has been for 70 years in captivity,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.880]   in exile in Babylon.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.680]   70 years beforehand, Babylon had stormed into Jerusalem,
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.280]   the Holy Sacred City.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.000]   And they had destroyed the walls, pulled them down,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.560]   rushed into the city and killed
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.800]   many of the Israelites there.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   And the significant thing they did
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.320]   was they destroyed the temple.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.760]   They literally raised the temple down to the ground
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.080]   so that it was not a beautiful, glorious building anymore,
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.680]   but rubble on the ground.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.960]   And this act threw the whole of Israel
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.120]   into an existential and theological crisis.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.000]   Because Israel were like, "Well, hang on a sec.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.600]   "The temple was the house of God.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.760]   "It was the presence of God on earth.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.040]   "It was where God dwelt.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.600]   "And when He dwelt with us,
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.720]   "that was where our comfort was, our security was,
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.920]   "where our life was.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.480]   "The temple was the symbol to Israel
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.040]   "that God was for them.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.960]   "And if God was for them, who can be against them?"
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.360]   And yet, these Babylonians, these Gentiles,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.720]   these foreigners had come in
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.280]   and they had destroyed the house of God.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.440]   And so whilst they're in exile in Babylon for 70 years,
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.200]   they're in this theological crisis
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.720]   and they're wondering, "Where are you, God?
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.640]   "What have you done?
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.000]   "Why have you gone away from us?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.560]   "Why have you given up on us?"
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.960]   Many of the Psalms in the book of the Psalms
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.800]   were written during that 70-year process.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.540]   That's why those Psalms are like, "Where are you, God?
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.240]   "My enemies are against me, but I will trust in you."
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.800]   At the end of the 70 years, something amazing happens.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.600]   Persia comes in and invades Babylon.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.900]   And Persia by then is a big, huge empire
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.200]   and they take over Babylon.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.320]   And they basically discover that there's all these Israelites
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.360]   that are there in exile, away from their home.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.400]   And the Persians allow the Israelites
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.840]   to return back to Jerusalem.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.340]   And they return back in three waves.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.740]   The first wave is on the leadership
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.040]   of a man named Zerubbabel.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.920]   And Zerubbabel was given one task and one task only.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.160]   He is told by God to go back
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.920]   with the first group of Israelites back to Jerusalem
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.500]   and begin to rebuild the temple.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.680]   Begin to get the temple back up into its former glory.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.200]   And you can understand why this is top of the list for Israel
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.680]   because they've realized that the destruction of that temple
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.880]   threw them into crisis.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.320]   As they go back to Jerusalem,
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   they wanna establish the temple, establish God's presence,
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.080]   and get God to be active with them
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.340]   to get that place of safety and security.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.060]   So Zerubbabel with the first wave of Israelites
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.400]   goes back to start the temple.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.980]   A little bit later, the second wave comes in.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.160]   And the second wave, you can imagine,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.980]   are so excited to see the temple.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.080]   They're excited because they were not the generation
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.740]   that saw the original temple.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.540]   70 years has passed and a lot of the people
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.860]   that laid eyes on the original temple
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.500]   have now died and passed away.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.580]   But the new group who have heard about the glory
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.520]   and the beauty and the majesty of the temple in Jerusalem,
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.900]   they're so excited that they get back,
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.940]   they're gonna expect to see
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.360]   this beautiful temple restored in Jerusalem.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   And the book of Zechariah, the prophet Zechariah,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.820]   is there in those moments.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.180]   And chapter four, actually, of Zechariah
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.340]   captures for us this moment where they return
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.300]   and they cast their eyes
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.500]   on what they were expecting to be this finished product,
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.820]   this beautiful temple,
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.060]   but was actually still at that time only rubble.
[00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:38.900]   And here's what they say.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.100]   This is from Zechariah four,
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.020]   I'm reading in the Good News translation.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.380]   They are disappointed
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.620]   because so little progress is being made.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.880]   Anyone here disappointed?
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.020]   Because it feels like for you
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.880]   so little progress is being made in your life
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.140]   or in your faith or in your relationship with God
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.700]   or in the things that you want, in the city of Hong Kong.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.780]   It feels like there's so little progress
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.940]   and you're frustrated and disappointed.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.140]   Here's the Israelites, they come back
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.740]   and they only see rubble
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.480]   when they're expecting to see the grandness,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.420]   the beauty and the bigness of the temple.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.780]   And they're disappointed, they're frustrated,
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.100]   and they're beginning to wonder again,
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.500]   where is God in this?
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.740]   Because if God was in it,
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.260]   surely there'd be this glorious big temple.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.880]   And we've got just rubble.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.260]   I love this reaction from the Israelites
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.980]   'cause I think it peers a little bit
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.640]   into every human soul.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.700]   'Cause here's the reality for us as humans.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.340]   We love the finished product,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.400]   but we're not so crazy about the unfinished process.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.460]   Are you with me?
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.860]   Like we love the idea of the finished product.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.860]   We want things to be nicely finished
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.060]   and completed and established
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.820]   with a beautiful little bow on top,
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.480]   but we're not so excited about the hard work,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.980]   the step-by-step, faithful little things
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   that need to be done to get us from where we are right now
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.900]   to where we're gonna go.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.620]   No, we want God to wave his magic wand,
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.020]   instantaneously give us this temple.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.860]   And when we show up and we realize
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.340]   there's still a long journey to go,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.700]   we get disappointed because we think
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.180]   that God is never in the unfinished process.
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.780]   We think God is just in the glorious temple.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:27.900]   When God so often moves more powerfully,
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.580]   in the small things than in the dramatic and the big.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.980]   In fact, God always goes from the small things
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.760]   to the big things because he wants to take you along
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.600]   with him.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.140]   Because if God didn't do that,
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.560]   chances are you would be lost in the middle
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.940]   of everything that he is doing.
[00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.340]   But actually when we realize that God is with us
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.700]   in the small, step-by-step, daily faithfulness
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.820]   that we have that doesn't seem grand, doesn't seem big,
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.460]   feels like we're walking way slower than we should be,
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.780]   but that process is the way that God actually moves us
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.540]   from the small to the big, but doesn't lose us in between.
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.700]   It's like, if everything God ever did was the big finish,
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:24.420]   there would be no small changes in us.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.740]   I mean, imagine with me for a moment, church,
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.040]   if God suddenly came through and did the grand
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.380]   and the big in your life.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.540]   Imagine if all of the dreams that you're holding
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.460]   on your heart right now, all the things that you want,
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.300]   imagine if God did those instantaneously for you.
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.340]   Like instantly you were successful,
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.340]   instantly famous, instantly wealthy,
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.220]   instantly having the marriage that you longed for,
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.580]   instantly with the perfect body.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.140]   Are you with me?
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.340]   Like imagine if God did the instantly,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.580]   and we have this weird perception as Christians
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.820]   that we understand in the human life, things take time,
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.620]   but with God, we think it needs to be instant.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.300]   But you need to realize that if you have
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.180]   the instantaneous things of God,
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.540]   here's two things that are gonna color your life,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.120]   two things that are gonna be a problem for you.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.780]   Number one, God is gonna become even more
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.020]   of a Santa Claus for you than he already is.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.720]   He's gonna be your little genie in that bottle
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.640]   that you can just rub, rub, rub, rub, rub every time,
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.140]   and boom, he gives it to you.
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.120]   But the second thing is even more important than that.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.060]   God understands that if he always did the instantaneous,
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.800]   always did the big thing in your life
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.620]   without taking you through the small things
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.220]   to get you there, he understands that if you got
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.900]   those big things, you would be incapable
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.140]   of holding onto them.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.140]   Incapable of keeping a hold of that success.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.280]   Incapable of actually holding onto that marriage
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.340]   that you had been longing and dreaming for.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.960]   Incapable when the first obstacles come
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.040]   that to letting actually go of that thing
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.920]   because you haven't experienced the process
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.040]   of how God was forming a character, an integrity,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.060]   and a strength of resolve, and a steadfastness,
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.100]   and a resolve in you to get you to the point
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.360]   where when the big happened, you could stand up
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.120]   with character, with integrity, and hold on
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.140]   to the big things 'cause the big things
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.660]   have big responsibility.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.480]   And God, for some of you in your life,
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.240]   you're super frustrated at God because you expected
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.360]   to be further along.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.400]   You are disappointed that there's just rubble
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.800]   and there's not a temple.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.680]   And God is looking upon you and he's saying,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.640]   do you wanna know where my anointing is right now?
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.380]   It's actually in the small, almost imperceptible
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.360]   little things that I'm chipping away at,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.120]   that I'm doing, that I'm processing in your life
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.820]   to get you to the point that when that great thing
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.000]   does happen, you're gonna walk into it
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   with flourishing in life and not be stripped away
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.140]   by all of this.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:01.280]   It's fascinating to me that we want the big things
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   from God, but we don't want God to start the small way.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.880]   Are you with me?
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.820]   This week marked the one year anniversary
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.260]   of me working out and eating healthy.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   One year, I turned COVID into the best year of my life.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.680]   And I can stand before you today at 46,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.440]   I just told you how old I was, we'll delete that later.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.880]   I can stand before you today at 46 and say,
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.060]   I'm in the best shape of my life.
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.080]   But I've got a long way to go.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.520]   Don't let these incredible arms fool you.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.840]   I've got a long, long way to go.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.560]   But I know that I am able to lift weights today
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.120]   that would have been impossible for me to lift a year ago.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.640]   In fact, if I had tried to lift those weights a year ago,
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.760]   I would have caused great injury to myself.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.660]   Some of you want something for God so bad
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.360]   that if he gave it to you, it would actually cause you
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.520]   more injury than life.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.820]   And that there actually is a process by which
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.160]   the daily, daily, for me, three times a week,
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.480]   faithfully of my workout trainer,
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.240]   to try to get some muscle, try to build some things,
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.700]   take it small, I mean, the weights,
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.400]   if you saw photos of the weights that I started with,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.300]   you'd be like, that guy's such a dweeb.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.700]   Even today, you might still think that.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.300]   But today I can lift weights way more
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.180]   than I could ever done before.
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.020]   Why?
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.940]   Because there's been a step-by-step faithfulness
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.560]   and some of you are in the training ground,
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.360]   but you wanna be at the finish line.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.400]   Is this speaking to anyone?
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.960]   And I wanna unpack this idea by taking a look
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.940]   at the broader context to what I think God is saying
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.000]   through Zachariah to Zerubbabel.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.980]   Can you imagine how it would have felt for Zerubbabel,
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.180]   the second wave come back and he's like,
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.100]   here's the foundation stones.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.680]   And everybody's like, where's the temple?
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:54.140]   And Zerubbabel's like, well, we've cleared a little ground
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.900]   and there's a few rocks kind of in place.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.740]   And God comes and speaks into Zerubbabel's spirit
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.940]   and I think he's gonna speak into some of your spirits
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.620]   this morning, let me read this to us from verse six.
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.420]   So he said to me, this is the word of the Lord
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.780]   to Zerubbabel, not by might nor by power,
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.500]   but by my spirit, says the Lord Almighty.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.420]   What are you, O mighty mountain?
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.820]   Before Zerubbabel, you will become level ground.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.860]   Then he will bring out the cornerstone,
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.460]   the capstone to shouts of God bless it, God bless it.
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.940]   Then the word of the Lord came to me,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.080]   the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.060]   of this temple, his hands will also complete it.
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.460]   Then you will know that the Lord Almighty
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.900]   has sent me to you.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.780]   Who despises the day of small things?
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.060]   Let me speak that over you and your spirit right now.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:48.060]   Who despises the day of the small things?
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:52.420]   In fact, I think that's a word for us in our city right now.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.800]   I wanna declare that today is the day
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.380]   of small things over Hong Kong.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.260]   'Cause I don't know about you,
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.820]   but I have big hopes and dreams for our city.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.460]   There are some big things that we feel we need God to do
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.900]   in this time and in this hour
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.100]   of Hong Kong's important history.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.820]   I mean, there's some big work to be done for the gospel.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.180]   Still something like 10% of people in Hong Kong know Jesus.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.380]   90% of the people do not know him.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.380]   We have a lot of work to do.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.340]   There are some big dreams that should be sitting
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.020]   on our hearts, big things that are pulling us forward.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.820]   I mean, believing that we're gonna become a river
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.820]   and not just a house,
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.700]   believing we're gonna see reconciliation and healing
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.260]   like we've never seen before.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.380]   Believing that Hong Kong can find a new identity
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.340]   and find itself being stabilized,
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.260]   maybe reconciliation taking place, whatever it might be.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.900]   I mean, big things that only God can do.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.900]   And the danger for us as the church in this city right now
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.140]   is that we are wanting the instantaneous big thing
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.780]   without the actual small, faithful, step-by-step day
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.860]   of small things that's gonna get us from A to B
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.620]   in the way that we can then hold on to B when it comes.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.180]   You're with me.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.820]   And I feel like God is opening up this opportunity for us,
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.420]   this different spirit in us,
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.700]   that we would no longer despise the day of the small thing.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.180]   And it's not just for the city,
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.420]   but it's also for you personally.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.300]   It's for each one of you in this room.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.340]   What is it that you're currently holding
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.260]   that you're really frustrated
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.300]   because it doesn't feel like God's coming through
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.860]   in that timing that you were hoping?
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.140]   What is the thing that's kind of sitting in your hands
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.700]   that doesn't seem like much
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:34.220]   when you had so much of a dream on your heart?
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.500]   I wonder how many of us in this room
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.660]   are wondering when God's gonna show up,
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.740]   when God's gonna complete it,
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.980]   when God's gonna actually move.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.340]   I think there's two times in life
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.460]   where we often ask that question.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.140]   One is during travel, and one is when we're cooking.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.980]   Have you ever been on a road trip with some friends
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.020]   or with your family, with kids, right,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.140]   and you're driving around,
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.580]   and what's the first question that comes
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.460]   as soon as you've left your house?
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.580]   Are we there yet?
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.420]   We literally just left the house, you know?
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.860]   Or maybe the Hong Kong version of this,
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.060]   like we're sitting on an airplane.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.900]   Remember airplanes?
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.620]   They're the things that fly in the sky, right?
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.220]   We're sitting on an airplane,
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.380]   and we've got our kids next to us on the seat,
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.860]   and we're heading to the UK,
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.580]   11-hour, 12-hour flight,
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.620]   and hour one, the kids are like, "Are we there yet?"
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.300]   Like we literally just left the airport one hour ago.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.580]   We got 10 more of these hours until we get there, right?
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.680]   Or what about cooking?
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.260]   I, yeah, man, I work hard on Sundays.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.540]   I just want you to know.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.720]   My wife's not at this service.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.840]   She was at the previous service,
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.140]   but I can really open it up today,
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.660]   now that she's not at this service,
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.060]   but I work really hard.
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.180]   Four services, preach my gut out.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.260]   I literally like get home, I open.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.520]   Now, Sunday is the only day in the week
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.540]   when our amazing domestic helper, Lizelle, is not with us,
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.060]   and we, you know, it's awesome, bless her day off.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.740]   We hate it, though, 'cause we have to cook, right?
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.020]   Like, and Chris and I are, sorry, honey,
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.540]   really bad cooks, we're really bad cooks, right?
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.540]   So I've just done this crazy day, I'm super tired.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.220]   I literally like open the front door.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.940]   I collapse into the apartment, right?
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.260]   And there, our kitchen's right there in the front door,
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.260]   and I peer my head around, and there's Chris over the stove,
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.100]   and I'm like, "Is it ready yet?"
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:23.380]   This is when we have a domestic discussion every Sunday.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:28.500]   And my wife will often say, "I literally just put it on.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.380]   "You just walked in the house, right?
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.540]   "Like, go and wash your hands,
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.100]   "and have a shower, and do whatever."
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.860]   Like, I'm just, or I'll say, "Is it ready yet?"
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.380]   She's like, "Yeah, it is, if you like it raw."
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.820]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.820]   "Would you like it raw, 'cause it's..."
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.100]   And some of you in this room,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.140]   that's the way you treat God,
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.900]   that's the way you have a relationship with God.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.980]   You're expecting God to always be instantaneous
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.260]   in your life, and you've been waiting, maybe,
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.420]   for a period of time, and you're coming into the house,
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.960]   and you're going, "God, is it ready yet?
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.900]   "Because I'm ready, is it ready yet?"
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.660]   And God's saying, "No, yeah, it is ready,
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.000]   "if you like it raw, like, if you like it
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.580]   "the way it is right now, but if you wanna be a sweet taste,
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.980]   "if you wanna be a delicacy, if you wanna be the person
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.760]   "that I'm forming and shaping in you,
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.540]   "you're not quite ready yet to be released
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.780]   "for what it is that I'm about to do.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.780]   "It will crush you, the weight of it.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.140]   "I got some more work to do in you.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.420]   "Will you be faithful to the day of the small thing,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.980]   "to the thing that I'm doing in your life,
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.260]   "right here, right now, just,
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.740]   "that seems almost imperceptible?"
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.260]   You want the grand, but my presence is here in the small.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:36.500]   And it's interesting, 'cause Zerubbabel gets this
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   in verse six, this is what the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel,
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.380]   "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,"
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.020]   says the Lord.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.260]   See, I love this, 'cause God wants to help Zerubbabel
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.480]   to understand that the project that he's called him to do,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.580]   to rebuild the temple, is way beyond his ability,
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.420]   that that temple building thing, that massive thing,
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.060]   is so big that it can only sit in God's hands,
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.260]   it cannot sit in Zerubbabel's hands.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.700]   The dream that God has for Zerubbabel is so big on purpose
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.980]   so that Zerubbabel doesn't think that his might
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.500]   or his power can accomplish it.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.380]   Some of you are frustrated in this room,
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.940]   and you're using all of your strength, all of your power,
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.140]   all of your might, to try to bring about the things of God
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.500]   that can only be brought about by his spirit.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.540]   And he designs the big things in your life to be so big
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.820]   that your power and your might cannot get there.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.900]   And we despise the small things
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.860]   because we think that the small things
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.980]   could never add up to the big thing.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.980]   And God's saying, "My math is a little different to yours,
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.180]   "'cause it's not your might nor your power,
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.260]   "but it will be my spirit," says the Lord.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.980]   Notice this in the second half of verse seven.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.420]   "Then Zerubbabel will bring out the capstone
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:58.420]   "the cornerstone to shouts of, 'God bless it, God bless it.'"
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.780]   This is God saying,
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.260]   "This is how my temple is going to be built."
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.580]   That massive big thing that you can't do
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.020]   in your power and your might.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.500]   It's going to be built this way.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.580]   Zerubbabel is going to bring out
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.780]   before all of the disgruntled, all of the despising,
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.260]   all of the people that are disappointed
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.220]   with the progress that's being made,
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.060]   he's gonna bring out the one piece, the cornerstone,
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.580]   the capstone, the first stone to be laid.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.180]   And all of you disgruntled people,
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.540]   here's what I want you to do.
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.180]   I want you to shout, "God bless it, God bless it."
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.020]   Why?
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.140]   Because in doing that,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.820]   you're saying something prophetically.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.820]   You're saying it's not by our power, it's not by our might,
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.780]   it's by the spirit that's gonna build this temple.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.540]   Like this cornerstone doesn't have the strength in itself
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.420]   to hold up the whole of the building.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.460]   But if we pray that God will bless it,
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.580]   even the small stone will be the beginning
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.340]   of the big project.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.260]   Oh, but we love the finished product,
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.020]   but we don't want to go through the unfinished process.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.860]   God says to Israel, "Take that very small thing
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.200]   "that seems so feeble, so weak, and pray over it.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.060]   "God bless it, God bless it."
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.060]   And watch what God can do
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.080]   when he can take the small thing in your life,
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.860]   the thing that he's called you to be faithful with right now.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.260]   Yeah, you want that promotion.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.780]   Yes, you want that success.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.260]   Of course you wanna get married.
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.540]   God understands all that,
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.900]   but he's put something in your hand right now
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.620]   that is the cornerstone, and he's saying, "Bless that."
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.700]   Like pray, speak life,
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.780]   bless the thing that I've put in your hands.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.500]   And from there, not by your power, not by your might,
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.940]   but by my spirit, says the Lord.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.080]   Then see what's gonna take place before you.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.320]   This is why Zerubbabel is told this in verse seven,
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.200]   right at the start.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.040]   This is God speaking.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.220]   He goes, "What are you, O mighty mountain?
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.280]   "Before Zerubbabel, you will become a level ground.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.280]   "What are you, O mountain, O obstacle?"
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.360]   There are always going to be obstacles
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.720]   between our small start and the big finish.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.920]   It's always gonna be the big things that are there,
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.520]   and God stands before Israel,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.800]   and he speaks to the big obstacles.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.780]   And he says, "What are you, O mountain?
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.640]   "You'll be nothing.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.200]   "You're gonna become a level ground before Zerubbabel.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.040]   "Why?
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.000]   "Because it's by my spirit.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.820]   "If it was up to might and power of my humans,
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.600]   "the obstacles will overwhelm them every single time."
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.540]   This is jumping us back to Numbers 13 and 14, isn't it?
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.160]   Where the Israelites go in to what God has promised,
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.960]   the big thing of the promised land,
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.800]   and they go in there,
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.360]   and they're overwhelmed by the obstacle in front of it.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   And they're so overwhelmed
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.560]   that they turn their back on the big thing.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.240]   And God's saying to Israel, "If you live by my spirit,
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.280]   "if you take the small things, the beginning thing,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.360]   "and you say, 'God, bless this, just this little,
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.340]   "'this is my offering, this is all I've got,
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.360]   "'this is all I am right now, this thing here,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.080]   "'would you bless it, would you bless it?'"
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.120]   Watch what he can do.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.680]   Even the greatest obstacles can be rendered down,
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.340]   can be pulled flat before him.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.200]   You cannot pull down the obstacles,
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.240]   but the Spirit of God working in your faithfulness
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.320]   on the day-to-day things that you're doing
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.360]   can literally move mountains.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.640]   Will you focus on the small?
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.880]   I wonder if this reminds you of anything else
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.120]   that we see in Scripture.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:31.000]   Some 600 years later, Jesus is gathered with his disciples,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.600]   and he's trying to teach them a little bit
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.320]   about the kingdom of God.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.360]   And in this moment, he gathers them around him,
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.780]   and he draws from the imagery of Zechariah 4.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.520]   And he's trying to communicate to them
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.600]   the kind of faith that they need
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.840]   for the journey that's ahead of them.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.960]   I want you to see this from Matthew 17,
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.800]   starting in verse 20.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.660]   It says, "I tell you the truth.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.680]   "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed,
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.160]   "you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here and there,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.800]   "'and it will move, for nothing will be impossible for you.'"
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.400]   If you have faith as small as a mustard seed,
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.920]   this mountain will be changed, will be moved down.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.000]   This is imagery from Zechariah 4.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.080]   Jesus is taking it,
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.660]   speaking familiar imagery over his disciples.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.160]   They knew the Old Testament well.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.400]   And he's trying to tell them,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.440]   all you need to do is have some small faith.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.040]   Now, we misinterpret this verse all the time.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.080]   Preachers mispreach this all the time.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.280]   They stand in front of their churches,
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.500]   and they go, "You gotta have more faith.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.700]   "Like, if only we have more faith,
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.780]   "the mountains will move.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.000]   "Let's get more faith."
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.760]   And Jesus is saying the exact opposite.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.680]   He's saying it doesn't matter the bigness,
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.360]   the size of your faith.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.600]   What matters, even if your faith is as small
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.160]   as a mustard seed, what matters is God bless it.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.000]   God bless it.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.200]   Like, if you give it to me, I will move the mountains.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   Nothing will be impossible for you.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.640]   And this is God's invitation to his church,
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.920]   to recognize that it's not about them,
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.520]   just the smallest faith
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.520]   that almost seems imperceptible
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.980]   to everybody else around you.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.600]   That one person where you look at their life,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.200]   and you say, "I don't think they're really a Christian."
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.360]   That one person that you judge across the aisle on Sundays.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.600]   If they dress like that, they must be not really
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.760]   a Bible-believing, spirit-filled Christian.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:20.960]   The ones who often do the greatest things
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.520]   in the New Testament are the ones
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.880]   that were least expected to do the great things.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   Because everybody was like the Pharisees,
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.240]   looking for the big and the perfect and the holy and the that.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.440]   And Jesus comes along and says, "You see that centurion?
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.200]   "You see that woman who bled for 12 years
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.760]   "and you all avoided her?
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.080]   "You see this woman who's just anointed me
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.120]   "and you think she's a prostitute?
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.600]   "You see all of this?
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.040]   "A faith as small as a mustard seed.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.640]   "It's the day of small things.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.560]   "I work to the big when the small step by step,
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.160]   "and it's a little bit of faithfulness.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.920]   "I then join that faithfulness
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.840]   "and watch what is about to take place."
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.680]   And there's this great bit here.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.440]   It says, "If only then the mountain
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.600]   "would become level ground."
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.240]   Zerubbabel, you will see it.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.960]   It will become level ground before you.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.240]   When I took on the vine in 2013,
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.000]   I was handed $25 million in debt.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.680]   This church was $25 million Hong Kong dollars in debt.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.800]   And I knew that was coming to me.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.440]   I knew that was part of the deal.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.960]   Didn't like it.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.400]   And I have to say, at the time, I was like,
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.640]   this is a little bit overwhelming.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.480]   I was 37 years old.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.120]   And I knew on the one side that this wasn't my debt.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.080]   It was the vine's debt.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.320]   I knew that this was all of our responsibility,
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   not just my responsibility.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.480]   But you know, as a 37-year-old, new, fresh senior pastor,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.800]   stepping into a role of two incredible men,
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.720]   John and Tony had done such a fantastic job
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.040]   of leading this church all these years.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.960]   There was already so much pressure.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.400]   And then it was $25 million.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.480]   And I remember thinking to myself,
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.560]   I don't have John's gift of fundraising.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.520]   I'm not like that.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.480]   I don't have the ability to stand in front of people
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.920]   and ask them for money and all this kind of stuff.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.560]   Like, that's not really who I am.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.040]   And I remember feeling so overwhelmed by the giant.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.720]   And I wanted God just to remove it from me.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.600]   I wanted like one person to write a $25 million check
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.680]   and then everything's done and gone, right?
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.760]   Ever prayed those prayers?
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.200]   God, I want the finished product now.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.840]   I don't want the unfinished process.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.760]   And I remember praying about this
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.840]   'cause it was weighing on me.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:27.960]   I was stressed about it.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.200]   It was overwhelming to me.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.120]   And God said, "Andrew, what have I put in your hands?"
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.520]   And I was like, "$25 million in debt."
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.360]   No, just kidding.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.760]   No. (audience laughing)
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.200]   I was like, "Well, I love to preach.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.000]   "I love to preach and teach."
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.520]   He's like, "You stay faithful to what I put in your hands.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.560]   "I will provide and I'll remove the debt from you."
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.120]   Now, I'd like to say it happened by a $25 million check.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.640]   I thought it was gonna take maybe five years,
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.880]   maybe 10 years.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.960]   We were able to wipe out the debt in a year and a half.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.160]   Why?
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.720]   Because so many people in this room
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.880]   were incredibly generous
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.800]   and were willing to do the small thing
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:07.720]   that was in their hand.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.800]   Here's $100 regularly every week.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.640]   Here's $1,000.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.480]   Here's 10,000.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.960]   We had some people write $1 million.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.120]   We had a lot of people do a lot of faithful,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.800]   generous things because they took the small thing
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.000]   that was in their hand
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.960]   and they're willing to say, "God bless it, God bless it."
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.320]   And as a group together,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.160]   we were able to see 25 million just descend like that.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.680]   That's my heart for us as a church.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.800]   What is my heart?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.680]   That you would recognize that the small thing
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.960]   God has put in your hand,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.240]   even though at times it might feel like the big thing
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.880]   is a long, long way off,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.680]   that small thing blessed by God
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.480]   can be a blessing way beyond
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.760]   you would ever think or ever imagine.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.480]   You are a small thing in God's hands.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.800]   You're not that important.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.240]   You're not that talented.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.400]   You're not that amazing.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.560]   There's always gonna be more talented,
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.080]   better looking, perfect bodies.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.160]   (congregation laughing)
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.680]   It's always gonna be that other person
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.040]   that you wish you were to be.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.720]   You're always gonna feel small in somebody's eyes
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.040]   and probably in your eyes.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.040]   You are a small thing,
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.920]   but you're a small thing in the hand of a father
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.560]   who stands over you and says, "God bless this one.
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.840]   "God bless this one.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.480]   "Let's see what I might do through this."
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.800]   'Cause it's not by their might, nor by their power.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.680]   And their resume is good and their studies are good
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   and they've got some great skills,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.800]   and that's all good, and God uses that stuff.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.760]   But it's by my spirit that's really gonna do this.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:29.680]   (congregation applauding)
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   So here's,
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.240]   thank you.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.800]   Here's verse eight.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.560]   "Then the word of the Lord came to me and said this,
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.280]   "'The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundations
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.120]   "'of this temple.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.360]   "'His hands will also complete this.'"
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.040]   Could you imagine what it would've been like for Zerubbabel?
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.120]   He's standing in the rubble,
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.240]   and he's standing in all that rubble,
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.320]   and everybody's despising that there's not more progress
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.920]   that's been made, and God says,
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.840]   "Zerubbabel, you're gonna bring out the cornerstone.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.600]   "You're gonna say, 'God bless it, God bless it.'"
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.720]   And then in front of everybody, God says,
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.520]   "Your hands will lay the foundation of this temple.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.200]   "Your hands will see it completed."
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.880]   In other words, I'm a faithful God.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.800]   I'm gonna be with you every step of the way.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.120]   I'm not just there at the start,
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.040]   but I will walk with you every small,
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.080]   every step you do all the way to the end.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.360]   You're gonna lay down the foundation stone,
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.960]   then you're gonna grab the next brick,
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.520]   and then you're gonna grab the next brick,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.440]   and there's a hundred other people that will grab bricks,
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.520]   and you're all gonna build,
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.760]   and you will eventually stand back, Zerubbabel,
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.680]   and you will see the glory of the temple.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.520]   But right now, do not despise the day of small things.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:37.120]   Right now, recognize that I'm at work in this very moment.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.280]   Your hands will start it, your hands will complete it.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.640]   I love the focus on the hands of Zerubbabel,
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.800]   'cause God could've snapped his fingers
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.520]   and created the temple just like that.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.160]   He had the might and the power to do so.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.080]   But God doesn't do that,
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.720]   because he knows that in his hands he could,
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.040]   but he also knows that in Zerubbabel's hands he can't.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.680]   So he doesn't ask him to do the great big thing.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.480]   He just says, do the first thing,
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.160]   the cornerstone, the capstone, and bless it,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.040]   and then take the next stone and do that,
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.840]   and in your faithfulness,
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.520]   you will see something significant take place.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.240]   I think Hong Kong is crying out now for churches.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.320]   They're just willing to do the next thing,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.440]   the small thing,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.680]   the thing that they have been called to do
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.240]   in their workplaces, in their schools, in their families,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.160]   to begin to really begin to see
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.480]   the work of the temple of God.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.220]   Some of you in this room,
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.160]   you're disappointed in yourself
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.560]   because you don't see the temple there.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.400]   When God looks at you and he says,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.320]   oh, there's this unfinished temple that I'm creating,
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.120]   and I'm so excited about it,
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.400]   there's so much more to come.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.280]   Some of you here, you don't realize this,
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.360]   but you're a dream in God's heart.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.400]   And he wants you to basically say,
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.640]   I'm not the finished product,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   but I have a cornerstone in me.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.840]   I have the little small thing right now,
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.560]   and I'm trusting the faithfulness to the small thing.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.640]   I'm leaving the big thing up to him,
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.280]   but I'm gonna trust him with the small thing in my hands.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.420]   What is the small thing that is in your hand right now?
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.120]   The one thing that God has given you,
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.720]   where if you think about all that needs
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.380]   to be accomplished and done, it'll overwhelm you,
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.640]   but that small little thing
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.800]   that he's just placed in your hand,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.480]   what is that right now for you?
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.280]   As I close, let me tell you what it is for me.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.360]   I'm writing a book, and if my wife was here,
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.680]   she would roll her eyes,
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.440]   'cause I've said that phrase for the last decade of my life,
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.940]   and I have not written a book yet.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:43.560]   I have four lines, the opening four lines of my book,
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.480]   that is literally what I have on my computer right now.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.720]   If you were here last Sunday,
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.800]   you would have seen me do the parable of the prodigal son
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   in first-person narrative, remember?
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.820]   So my book, what I'm writing is,
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.000]   I'm writing the first three chapters of the Bible,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.600]   Genesis 1, 2, and 3, so creation and full,
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.920]   and I'm writing it from the first-person perspective
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.680]   of Adam and Eve.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.520]   Cool, right?
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.440]   Okay.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.600]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.680]   It's gonna be a bestseller.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.280]   And I have four lines.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.360]   I mean, they're really good lines,
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.060]   but I have four lines.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.260]   It's like a cornerstone.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.480]   Would you like to hear them?
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.680]   Okay, I'm gonna read you my four lines.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.040]   Here they are.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.960]   This is the opening of my book.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.360]   "I was born of dirt and breath and hope.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.960]   Hope conceived me, its tender finger
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.720]   impregnating the barren soil
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.480]   as it carefully shaped the potential of man.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.000]   Breath birthed me, a wisp of sound and syllables
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.080]   rushing forth the glory of life,
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.660]   and dirt betrayed me,
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.740]   the very substance that brought me to life
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.640]   becoming the very substance that would lead me to death."
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.020]   (congregation applauding)
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.560]   Four sentences.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.780]   I need, it's not ready yet, no.
[00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.680]   I'm gonna need 60,000, 100,000,
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.600]   and it feels like a long way away,
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.280]   and I'm pretty happy with my first four sentences,
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.360]   but there's a lot more sentences that need to come.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.000]   And I stand over this today in front of you,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.180]   and I say, "God bless it, God bless it."
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.520]   'Cause that's all I've got.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.920]   And maybe there's something in your hands right now,
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.040]   a dream, a hope, a vision, an idea,
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.440]   new thing to do at work,
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.880]   a new thing you want for your family,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.440]   maybe that marriage we're talking about,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.400]   maybe you are working out and wanting a better body,
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.520]   whatever it is, there's something in front of you,
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.200]   and you've just got what you've got right now,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.400]   and it disappoints you.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.040]   Take it in your hands today,
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.400]   and say, "God bless it, God bless it."
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.400]   Do not, church, despise the day of small things.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.280]   Could you stand with me?
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.120]   Let's pray.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:51.380]   Father, we stand together as a church right now,
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.640]   recognizing that we're people just like the Israelites,
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.680]   who are obsessed with the big and the grand,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.820]   that we want the finished product,
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:08.800]   and we're not so crazy about the unfinished process.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:13.380]   And Father, as we stand before you in this moment,
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.760]   online and in this room,
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.300]   Father, we do so now with open hearts, open minds,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.920]   and with open hands.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.760]   Lord, you've been speaking a lot in this scripture
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.620]   about hands today.
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.480]   And I wonder whether you would just join me,
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.560]   if you're willing, just to open your hands before you,
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.120]   and in your hands, I want you to picture
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.300]   what that thing is that you've resonated with today.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.720]   Maybe for some of you, it's a long-held dream
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.540]   that hasn't yet come to fruition.
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.320]   Maybe it's a word or a promise of God
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.240]   that He's spoken over you at some point in your life
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.740]   that is yet to be fulfilled.
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.820]   Maybe it's a project that you're working on
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.140]   that seems a long way off, like my book.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.160]   Maybe it's whatever it is,
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.840]   but there's something in your hands today
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.560]   and that small thing, it's very easy for you to despise.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.440]   It's very easy for you to be frustrated.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.320]   It's very easy for you to feel like it's not worth much.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.300]   It's not valuable.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.960]   Like the Israelites, when they looked at those rubble stones,
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.160]   were like, so surprised that not more progress
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.600]   has been made.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.000]   And yet you're holding this thing
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.100]   because the Lord has put it in your hands.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.880]   And God would say, first of all, over you,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.320]   your hands will begin it.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.720]   Your hands will complete it.
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.760]   I'll be with you every step of the way.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.280]   For I'm God, your Savior,
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.880]   'cause it's not gonna be by your power.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.440]   It's not gonna be by your might.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.800]   It's gonna be by my Spirit.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.960]   And that thing you're holding in your hands,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.480]   feel the Spirit, the presence of God
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.000]   leaning over you right now and saying these words,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.440]   God bless it, God bless it.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.240]   And as your senior pastor, I stand over you now
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.120]   as you're in this room with your eyes closed
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.840]   or whether you're online as well,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.800]   and you got your hands and you're holding forward something,
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.040]   allow me and the authority that's given to me
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.720]   here at this church to speak over you now.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   God bless it, God bless it, God bless it, God bless it.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.560]   Take the small things, Lord.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.000]   The things that we've almost given up on,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.700]   the things that we were gonna throw away,
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.760]   the things that we felt like weren't worthy, Lord.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.660]   We take the cornerstones, the rubble, Lord,
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.480]   that's gonna place the foundations of the temple.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.680]   And Lord, we play a blessing over it
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.880]   in the name of Jesus right now.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.400]   And Father, I wanna pray that you would leave
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.280]   or send out a bunch of people from this room today
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.160]   who are going with a stronger step,
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.320]   with more hope in their hearts
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.520]   because of the day of small things.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.960]   That they would take what the Scriptures say
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.240]   and ask you to come and bless these small things.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.800]   That Lord, you would rise up hope
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.720]   and that we would see, like with those $25 million,
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.120]   that the big mountain would be chipped away at and removed
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.600]   just by the small mustard seed of those faithful day in,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.760]   day out in disciplines, conviction, prayers, hope,
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:10.320]   holding on in steadfastness
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.200]   for all the things that God can do.
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.360]   Lord, take the small thing that is in our hands.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.400]   Would you bless it and would it be your Spirit
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:22.920]   that brings it to the fullness of fruition?
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.600]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.780]   (upbeat music)
