[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   and may we be transformed in Jesus name. Amen.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Amen. Thank you Carla. Good afternoon church.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Good afternoon.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Yes, I'm Jennifer. So if you have been involving in CG's, I think you have seen me around already.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   But in case you don't, my name is Jennifer and I've been on the pastoral team for almost four years now.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   So let me share a little bit on the story that four years ago, the former CG pastor who was Pastor Tim,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   the current lead pastor of Yuen Long Church, has invited me to join the pastoral team, to join his team, the CG team.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   So it's been a journey, but long story short, I said yes eventually.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And then I'm here on the pastoral team and leading the CG ministry, which I really enjoy working with our leaders and volunteers.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So I've been grateful for these four years and it's a privilege for me to share the word with you all today.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   So I was chatting with my younger brother last week.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   I told him that, "Oh, next week I'm going to preach on the topic of forgiveness."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And then he laughed immediately. He was like, "You? Teaching on forgiveness? Seriously?"
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So growing up, we were very close. So why did he laugh?
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I think my colleagues will be able to testify that I have a slightly better memory than average.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   So I remember things. So it's kind of convenient at work that I remember things.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   It makes my work efficient and it's also good for me because I am in a bigger church that it helps me to remember people, to remember you.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   But when it comes to forgiveness, it's not that helpful.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   So what my brother would describe is I have a register to record who has offended me, how they have offended me, and then that register is stickered in my Bible.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   So this is how I describe it. But FYI, I don't have that register.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   But it is true that these things do stay in my head.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   But the good news is we heard about the past few weeks that forgiveness is not just about forgetting.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And no matter how forgetful we are, there must be things that you struggle with letting go, that you struggle with forgiving perhaps.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   If you are wrestling with this, you are not alone. I'm there.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And then the past three weeks we have been hearing and reflecting on the importance of forgiveness, how we receive forgiveness from God, and also what forgiveness is.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So this week we are looking into the topic of forgiving others.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Before we open the Bible together, I have a question for us.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I wonder what does it look like when we struggle with forgiving people?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Those people that we need to see regularly.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Perhaps not those people who step on your feet on MTR, but perhaps your colleagues, your family members, your friends, or perhaps people from the church community.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   If they have offended you, how would that impact you?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   When you struggle with forgiving them, how would you react or what comes to your mind when you see them?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Do you just try to hide your thoughts and emotions and try to act normal in front of people?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Would you try to avoid those people?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Or would you try to exclude them from your circle from now on?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   For me, if someone offended me, I would definitely go towards the avoidance side.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   If you offend me, I don't want to see you. I don't want to talk to you.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   If I see you in the pantry, I would not go to get water even if I'm thirsty.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   If I see you in the lower house, I would probably go to the top of the upper house.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And if I am meeting a family member, maybe I would just get the furthest seat at my family dinner.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I don't know whether you can resonate with any of these.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But this is not God's intent for us to be, right?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Especially when it happens in our church community.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   We are brothers and sisters and we are all part of the body of Christ.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So today, we will look into forgiveness within the church body in our early church.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Last week, Derek shared one of the biblical examples on forgiveness.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   With Stephen getting stoned by the Jews, before he died, he released his forgiveness to the people who killed him.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And this is such a beautiful testimony from a follower of Christ.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I would like to continue to read the immediate verses after that.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   "While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.'
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Then he fell on his knees and cried out, 'Lord, do not hold this sin against them.'
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   When he had said this, he fell asleep."
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And immediately after this verse, the scripture says, "And Saul approved of their killing him.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   On that day, a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But Saul began to destroy the church, going from house to house.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   He dragged both men and women and put them in prison."
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So the scripture immediately tells us that it was Saul who approved the killing.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We know that this person, this Saul, is the apostle Paul, who has done a lot for the church community.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And he, before his conversion, approved the killing of Stephen.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And now Stephen is with Jesus, so he doesn't need to struggle with his forgiveness anymore.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Actually, he doesn't need to struggle with anything, perhaps.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   But how about his brothers and sisters who lost Stephen?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   If we read chapter 6 of Acts, we can see that Stephen was one of the seven people
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   the twelve apostles appointed to help with the ministry.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And the scripture describes Stephen as a man full of God's grace and power,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   who performed great wonders and signs among the people.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Such a faithful brother that they have lost.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Those who witnessed would need to struggle with their emotions.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   They mourned deeply for Stephen.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And there were even more people who got imprisoned and got killed after that.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So can we imagine how would the church community feel towards the Jews, feel towards Saul?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Sometimes when we read the passage, we move on too fast.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Oh, here's Paul, the great apostle of the church, who has done so much for Jesus later,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   and wrote so many letters that we are still reading today.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   That builds up our faith.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And perhaps sometimes we miss how horrible it was to the early church.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   In their eyes, Saul was a murderer who killed a lot of Christians, who oppressed the church.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   This is who Saul is in their eyes.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   If I were one of the Christians among them, I would definitely struggle with forgiving them.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And this is something I will remember forever.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   But remember in the past few weeks, we have unpacked about forgiveness.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And we mentioned that we can't rely on our own strength to forgive.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And indeed, God's work in forgiveness has been amazing.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And we continue to read, we will see how God moved people in this journey of forgiveness.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Chapter 9 of Acts.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   "Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And the Lord said to him in Ephesians, 'Ananias.'
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And he said, 'Here I am, Lord.'
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And the Lord said to him, 'Get up and go to the street called Straight,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And he has seen in Ephesians a man named Ananias come in and lay his hand on him,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   so that he might regain his sight.'
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   But Ananias answered, 'Lord, I have heard from many people about this man,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   how much harm he did to your saints in Jerusalem.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And here he has authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.'
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   But the Lord said to him, 'Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   For I will show him how much he must suffer in behalf of my name.'
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   So Ananias departed and entered the house.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And after laying his hands on him said, 'Brother Saul,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.'
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And immediately something like fish scales fell from his eyes,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   and he regained his sight.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And he got up and was baptized, and he took food and was strengthened."
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   So we can see that from the story when Ananias first hears about the idea
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   to go find Saul and lay hands on him.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   He was unsure about that.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Saul was literally still on his way to persecute the church before his conversion.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The danger is real for Ananias before he even thinks about forgiveness.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   But God explains his plan to Ananias, telling him that he, Ananias,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   has a role in God's work to redeem Saul's life so that in future
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Saul can proclaim Jesus' name to Gentiles.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So I think most of us in this room fall within the Gentiles category, right?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Can we imagine if Ananias refused to go and didn't go find Saul?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I'm sure God can still do this in another way, but thankfully, Ananias chose to obey
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and be willing to be part of God's work.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I want us to pay attention to how Ananias addressed Paul when he gets there.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Firstly, when he was talking to God in his vision, he addressed Saul as "this man."
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Doesn't have a name for Saul.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   But when he gets there, when he saw Saul, he called him "brother Saul."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   This is significant.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Ananias knows his assignment from this name "brother," from this man to calling him "brother."
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   He has demonstrated forgiveness and acceptance to Paul
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   that he has included Saul into the Christian community, which is essential.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Because Jesus could have granted Saul sight in his way.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   He doesn't need to send anyone to go there.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   But he chose to send Ananias there.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Have we thought about why?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   God intended his people to be accepted in his community.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   No matter how terrible things we have done or how unworthy we think we are.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Jesus sent Ananias to Saul to accept him before he even proved that he is a worthy Christian.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   This is powerful, church.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Can we imagine how can Saul be convinced of the acceptance and forgiveness of God
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   if he didn't experience that from other Christians?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   However, being accepted by Ananias does not mean acceptance from the whole church community yet.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I want to continue to read the story as I want us to know.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It was uneasy for the early church as well.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It takes time for the community to go through the forgiveness journey.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   And different people will have their own pace, just like you and me.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   When Saul came to Jerusalem, he tried repeatedly to associate with the disciples,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and yet they were all afraid of him.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   As they did not believe that he was a disciple.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and described to them
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had talked to him.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And how he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus at Damascus.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And he was with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   but they were attempting to put him to death.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Now when the brothers learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   So the scripture emphasized that Saul repeatedly tried to associate with the disciples,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   but they were afraid of him.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Saul's conversion and repentance does not immediately lead to forgiveness and acceptance from the whole community.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   People still remember what he has done,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and they were probably still wrestling with the loss that they have experienced.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   How would they trust the murderer immediately, right?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   It indeed takes time and people's effort to encourage forgiveness to happen in the community.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Here we got a Barnabas who does not only offer his forgiveness to Saul,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   but also helps Saul to be forgiven by other people in the community.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Barnabas put in effort to help the community to see what has happened to Saul,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   and more importantly, to help the community to see his new identity as a Christian,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   and to help Saul being accepted by the community.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Forgiveness does not mean that what Saul has done is forgotten.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   In fact, what he has done will always be remembered,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   as these things are recorded in the Bible.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   But forgiveness is letting go of our sense of being wronged and offended,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   and to see the person in God's sights.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   To see them from God's perspective.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   And this act of forgiveness is to fulfill God's work in our community.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And at the same time, I want us to pay attention to Saul.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Saul also takes his ownership of actions.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Firstly, he didn't force others to forgive him.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   He didn't say to the other Christians,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   "You are a Christian, you're supposed to be gracious, you're supposed to be merciful,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   or you're supposed to be forgiving."
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   He didn't do that.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Also, if we read the letters that he has written for the church,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   he has not been hiding the things that he has done.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   He takes responsibility of his sins and actions,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and knows that it is by the grace of God he has been forgiven.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Forgiven by God, and forgiven by others.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Church, this is a reminder to us as well.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   If we have wronged others, take responsibility for our actions.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Ask for forgiveness with the posture of asking grace.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And for us who need to forgive others,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   we are not only doing that for the sake of our mental health.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   We are also doing the works of God.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Ananias, with his obedience, becomes part of God's plan to redeem Saul's life,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   so that Saul can be the apostle Paul in the future, whom God intends him to be.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And Barnabas and the whole church community works on their own forgiveness with Saul,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and together they have demonstrated forgiveness from Jesus to Paul.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   This is the church. This is who we are.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Started with a strong foundation of forgiveness.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Perhaps today in this room we don't have an apostle Paul for us to redeem today,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   but we will lay down our preferences and rights to fulfill God's work within our community.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I would like to share one of my stories in my community about my forgiveness,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   how struggled I was in the past.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   It took me a long time in this story,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and it also took a lot of people's effort to make it happen.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It happened in my uni time. I wasn't here yet. I was in my former church.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I was involved in a young adult community in my former church,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   who was similar to 180 here.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   So one time we were organizing an event, but the communication was bad,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and the event didn't go as we wished.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   So we ended up having a conflict among the organizers, a few of us.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So for sure I was part of the conflict.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And the people in the community knew eventually about the conflict,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and then they started to take sides, which we know this is unhelpful, right?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   But we were young, and so it happened.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   So at the beginning it wasn't that of a big deal,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   but it just got to the point that we couldn't really resolve it.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So as I shared at the beginning, when I get offended, I avoid people.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   So I made a bad decision that I stopped showing up to my community gathering,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and then eventually I got like, "I still want to be a community."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   But I made an even worse decision that I joined another community in the church.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And that church is not as big as ours, we only get a few hundred people,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   we all know each other.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   It was very weird that we see each other in church,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   but we avoid talking to each other, and then I was joining in our community.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   So almost half a year has passed, and some people from my original community
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   came to talk to me and told me that they missed me.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   "Jennifer, we miss you, we want you to come back."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   But I did not have the courage to have the conversation that I should have,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   to forgive and also to ask for their forgiveness on this.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So it took me a few more months to get myself together,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   to go back to my original community, and then we had a conversation,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and then we agreed to lay down what has happened,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   and continue to have fellowship together.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And from this experience, I personally experienced the power
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   of both forgiveness and unforgiveness in the church community,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   and how a few people's action can impact the whole community.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I think we can resonate with this, as long as we are in community,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   there's always conflict when we get offended or we offend other people,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   because we are all sinful people, and we all sin in different ways,
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   and we need to forgive in that case.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Even for Paul, later he got accepted in the church community,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   but it doesn't mean that there's no conflict after all.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   He still had a conflict afterwards with Mark, and it leads to splitting,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   it leads to more conflicts among the church community,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and later they sought out a relationship,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   and both Mark and Paul are doing very important works in our early church.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   So we see, as long as we are in community,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   we will come across with offenses and forgiveness.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Earlier this year, we have gone through the Efficience series together.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So this is a letter that Paul wrote,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and there is a short passage that Paul writes about forgiveness.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Let me read it to you.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   "Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   along with every form of malice.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Be kind and compassionate to one another,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   We see this is Paul's reflection on forgiveness in the community.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   It is essential for the church community to forgive one another,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   as unforgiveness would birth into something else
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   that would harm the whole church community.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And it is hard. It is not as simple as I just show up and say, "I forgive you,"
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   because we need to do that from the bottom of our heart.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   That's why it is difficult, especially when that person hurts you deeply.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Perhaps someone broke your trust, someone betrayed you,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   or even someone abused you.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Again, if you are in an abusive situation,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   do get help from the people you trust. This is important.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   But what I'm saying is, if you are deeply hurt by a person,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   the words of apologies does not have the magical powers to heal the wounds inside you.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   It always takes time and God's grace that we are healed,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   and to let true forgiveness to happen.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   I'm not sure what you are going through today.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I'm sure something comes to our mind today.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And it is hard, again, but you don't need to do this on your own.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   It is first by God's power and grace for us to have forgiveness,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   and also we have a community around us to support us.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   We don't need to walk this journey alone.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   So if any of you are struggling with forgiving other people,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   my prayer for you is that God will show you His perspective.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   He will give you the strength and the grace for you to walk through this forgiveness journey.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   If you have offended someone, if you need to ask for forgiveness,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   do repent and make your heart known to the people that you have offended.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   It is very important that we make known of our heart to each other,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and we ask for people's grace when it comes to asking people to forgive you.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And again, you will need God's strength and grace for you to be able to do that.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And if we see anyone struggling in our community with forgiveness,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   let's come around them. Let's encourage them.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Let's walk with them because it takes time.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And they don't need to go through this by themselves.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   If you are seeing anyone around you struggling with forgiveness, come around them.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Be the Ananias and Barnabas of your friends,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   so that we encourage forgiveness in our community to happen.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   My prayer is, as the body of Christ,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   we can demonstrate the love of the Christ and the power of forgiveness.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   As this is to fulfill God's work among us.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So right now, we get an opportunity to hear from our community,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   their testimony on their forgiveness.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And Pastor Jess will be facilitating that and invite our guests for today,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Charles and Allison.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Thank you, Pastor Jen. And let's welcome Mrs. Allison.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Allison and Charles, let's give them a warm welcome.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Yes. So Allison and Charles, you've both led community groups here.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Allison, you're currently serving on Alpha.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   And Charles, you've been involved, you've been leading a CG
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   and you've been involved in Cleansing Stream as well.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   And today we've heard a story from Jen's life within church community
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and we'll hear different communities from you both.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And Allison, why don't we start with you?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Could you share about just a recent testimony of conflict?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Sure. My story comes from the workplace.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   So ever since I was a teenager, I've dreamed of becoming a really kick-butt CEO.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I don't know if I'm allowed to say the word "butt" but I will just say it.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And I've had a passion for the corporate world and the business world.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   And for much of the last, you know, decade and a half I've been working since university,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I felt I was very successful and confident in my career.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   You know, in these companies that I worked for, every year they would give annual performance reviews
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and I tended to place pretty high.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   So it just affirmed the confidence I had in myself that, you know, I'm a good leader, I'm a good worker,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I'm recognized for my, you know, characteristics at work.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And identified as a high achiever.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   So when this incident came two years ago in the workplace, it was extremely hard for me.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   I had the toughest challenge yet in my career and I had a horrible relationship with my boss.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And my relationship with him wasn't always strange but suddenly a year into working with him,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   things took a really bad turn.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   We would often have very big team meetings.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Who has big team meetings, you know, when you have work?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Every time when I spoke up, I felt that he would vocally just humiliate me and turn the things down I said
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and make it known that, you know, what I was saying or suggesting was not the right way.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And he would get very vocally nasty in front of the whole team and say that to me.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And in other smaller team discussions, it was the same.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And, you know, he was very condescending in his speech.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   So I felt humiliated, I felt hurt, and I was surprised.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   And I tried to address this in our one-on-one discussions and ask him, you know,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   how do you see me doing better, Mr. Boss?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Because obviously there are some issues.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And it was a very hard discussion.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   He eventually never really gave any clear answers but made it known that he would be hiring someone else
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   to take over from my role.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   So that was very difficult for me.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Not easy. Thank you.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And Charles, could you share with us your family background?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Sure. Good morning, everyone.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I'm sharing a story from my family background.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I grew up in a family with a lot of relationship challenges,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   so there's a lot of emotional abuse happening within the family.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And eventually my parents are divorced, and my brother and I, after we got into university,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   we moved out of the family just to be on our own so that we can have some peace.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   So at first I thought I just--I'm in a clear,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   but because the family didn't really have a common practice of forgiveness and apology,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   so I actually needed to learn it much later on in my adult life.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   So I will share one example with you, one story with you.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   So this was when I was in my late 30s already, and at that time my father was in his 80s,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   and we were all living separately on our own.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And one year he had a stroke, and then, of course, the family rallied together to try to care for my dad.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   And during this time we found out that he actually has been involved in a mess for a while,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   and nobody in our family knew about it.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   So in order to help him out, I decided that at that time I was still single,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   so I moved back to be with him.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I packed up half of my belongings, I moved back, I still kept my place,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   trying to support my dad and try to hopefully--
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   hoping that he will not--he will have a new life and not be involved in messy situations again.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   So long story short, after about six months, I realized that--
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   my brother and I realized that my dad is still involved in a mess,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   and I was very upset because I put in a lot of effort.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   My life was really difficult, going to work, having two places, having pets to look after,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   like just really chaos.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   So I was really upset, so I packed my stuff and I went back home,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   and I just disassociated.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   So I felt like, "Okay, I'm back in my own place. I should be feeling better now."
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I learned a very valuable lesson during this season because when I moved back home,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   for the next six months, I was tortured by memories.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   And these are memories of my past wrongdoings, things that I've done that hurt people in the past.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And these are old stuff as well that I thought I have resolved with God,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   I've confessed and I thought I received forgiveness.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   But these memories, for some reason, in that season came back,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   and they would replay in my mind like movie trailers.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Imagine you have a movie trailer of your bad deeds playing.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   That's really a torture, actually.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   So after about six months, I really couldn't stand it, so I was thinking to myself,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   "What had actually really changed that this is happening?"
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And it still took me about two weeks to realize that it might be because I have held a grudge against my dad.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And at that point, I realized that I really need to forgive my dad.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   And also, at that point, because it was just a decision to forgive my dad,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I also realized I was holding a grudge based on my own choice as well,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   and the forgiveness was also a choice that I could make.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   So I made the choice to forgive my dad.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   When I made up with him, I totally behaved like normal again.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And actually, very, very, almost instantaneously,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   all the tormenting videos would stop playing in my mind again.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   So it was a very dramatic lesson for me.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And Charles, how did that impact you when you were growing up?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   How did you cope with people?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Because when I was growing up, there was a lot of emotional abuse,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   so I would withdraw, I would try to stay away from the pain, the source of the pain,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   and I would grow up to become a very self-reliant person
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   because I want to minimize my reliance on people so that I will have less pain.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Basically, that's how I coped with it when I was growing up.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   When I was in my late 20s, I learned a very valuable lesson in church life,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   which is to share it with others.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   I started to have safe mentors that I can meet with regularly,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   and I share my pain with them, and it really helped me out.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I even saw a therapist for about, I think, two years, so it really helped me out.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   One other thing, though, is when I was repeating these stories over a period of time,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I realized I was repeating it over and over,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   and I was still lacking a little bit of stuff to move forward.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Afterwards, I eventually realized that apart from sharing with people,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   forgiveness is the key that was missing in my life,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   so I needed to work forgiveness out into my life as well.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Yeah, and Allison, I know you worked with a therapist as well,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   but before we go there, how did you cope with that pain in this workplace?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   What did you do?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Yeah, I think before I got on my knees with the decision to forgive
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   because that was very hard, I felt like actually my voice was stolen in the workplace.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   That was very difficult for me.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   I'm usually a very vocal and direct person, but whenever there was a team meeting,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   I dreaded every day going to work, and I just felt like I wanted to be invisible.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I didn't want to be seen, and the worst was just seeing team members I hired and trained personally.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   They saw that the political tide was obviously not in my favor,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   so they would turn against me to ensure that they would still have a job at the end of the day.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   So it was very hurtful, and eventually I felt like I had no option
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   because I knew I would be replaced was to leave, to leave the company and to leave his leadership.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   But even that was hard because I would keep seeing him around Hong Kong.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   It turns out we went to the same grad school, me and this boss,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   and he would come up to me and be like, "Why do I keep still seeing you even after you left?"
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And I was like, "Well, I live in Hong Kong too, and we went to the same school."
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   So anyways, it was hard, but with time, and we can share about the forgiveness journey too
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   because I worked with a therapist, with the awesome community around me here,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and of course with God's help, all of that changed eventually.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   Yes, so how did the therapist and the community around you, what did that look like for you?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I sought the help of a career counselor who's also a Christian, and he knew me very well.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And he said, "You know, Alison, this is not who you are in the workplace."
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And he spoke some very affirming, life-giving words,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   and he encouraged me to write down a list of, you know, because I said my voice was like stolen,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   of what I'm thankful for and what my identity is in Christ in the workplace.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And I wrote all this down, and he said, "You know, read this aloud to your husband,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   and make sure he affirms you as well. He's here."
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And so that helped a lot, and it just helped remind me of my identity in Christ.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   My community here at The Vine have been really supportive.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   They kept listening to me when I was really down, and, you know, they really encouraged me
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   and told me, you know, "There is a future. This is not the only thing,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   that your work situation is not one that is going to stay.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   And as you move on, it will get better. This is not the end."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   And they prayed with me and believed with me, and eventually helped me to get to that place of,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   "I want to get rid of this chain holding me back. This is not worth it."
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Because I know I could do well in the workplace.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   It was this experience that I didn't want to be stuck in it anymore.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   So I think those things all helped.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   And so we hear from both of you how people around you, how the community around you,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   be it a therapist, a mentor, or the Christian community, have really helped you
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   to really go through that forgiveness, which we've heard it takes time.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   And we know we've heard that you've both chosen to forgive, and we just want to hear from you.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   What does walking out this forgiveness in your life look like?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Allison, why don't you start?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Okay, I would say it's definitely not an overnight forgiveness journey.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Even now today, when I think of this person, I wouldn't say I've 100% forgiven him.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   But it gets a little bit better every day.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   And just like Pastor Derek shared last week in his sermon, it was a decision.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   It started with a decision.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   "Hey, God, I'm really stuck in this. I really need your help to forgive."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Recognizing, vocalizing the pain it caused, and a conscious decision not to continuously dwell
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   in that hate and resentment circle.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And I would say that first step already helped immensely to let go of the pain and to forgive.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And, you know, if I were to see this leader that I had that caused me so much pain right now
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   to come up to me right now, I at least wouldn't punch him in the guts.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   Like, I would be, "Okay," and I would wish God's blessing upon him.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Because, you know, and eventually moving on to a new workplace where I felt like I was healed
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   and restored in my identity also helped.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   So sometimes leaving that was also helpful, but it was really the Holy Spirit and God
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   working in their heart to let go.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Yeah, thank you. And Charles?
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   I agree with Alison. I needed to make the choice.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   For me, because of what the Holy Spirit shared with me regarding my past sin against others,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   I find it non-negotiable these days with regard to forgiving others.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Because I realized I actually needed it more.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I needed God's forgiveness over my own sins more than the other person needing the forgiveness for me.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   So it's a very personal thing.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   I can feel the weight of sin coming back upon me when I was unforgiving towards my debt.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   And during even moments these days when I was edging back towards unforgiveness towards anyone,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I started to feel the weight again upon my heart.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   So because of that, I also remember, you know, there's a parable of the unforgiving servants that Jesus talked about.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   That this king had servants and there's this servant owed him like a million dollars, impossible debt, like 10 billion.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   I think it was a huge amount.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   And the king had mercy and just know that he couldn't pay, so he forgave him.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   And then the servant turned around and tried to chase down $1,000 or $10,000 from a fellow colleague.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   And it was outrageous.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   So the person was put back into prison to be tormented.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   So when I had that experience, I felt like, oh, I was an unmerciful servant.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   So through all these revelations of the Spirit, I now walk very cautiously.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Also, I know that after even 20 years of being a Christian,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   these days as I'm still working out how to overcome, working out the process of overcoming sin through the Holy Spirit,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   I still inadvertently would hurt people here and there.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   So even for myself, if I'm hurting people, how can I not forgive others as well?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   So that's why I am really cautiously living out forgiveness in my life on a regular basis.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Thank you both. We've really heard real life stories.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Real life stories of how they've struggled, how they've navigated the conflict and the forgiveness journey.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And really honor you and appreciate you both for sharing today.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   We hope that's blessed you. And let's give them a round of applause again.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Thank you. Thank you.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And now we're going to take some time to respond to God.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   So can I invite you all to stand?
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   And let me pray.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   God, we thank you for that reminder of that parable, how we have been so completely forgiven.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And we know, God, it's not easy.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   But right now, we just take some time and we pray that through your spirit, you will do that next bit of your work.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   That next bit of healing, of restoration, of helping us either to choose to release forgiveness
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   or to continually choose again and again and again and again to lay down our resentment.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Pray for anyone here who needs that chain of resentment to be loosened.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   And pray for anyone perhaps who knows that they are the one who needs to ask for forgiveness.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Holy Spirit, we just come before you now. It's your work. It's your grace.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   So let us just take a moment to encounter that grace right now.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
