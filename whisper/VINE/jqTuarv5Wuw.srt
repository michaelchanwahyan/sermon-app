1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Good morning. Hey, we're growing, eh? I love it.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 It's wonderful to be back with our family at Vinyon Long.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 This is always one of my favourite places, quite possibly my number one favourite place.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Please don't tell everybody I'm one shy.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Sandra and I love you guys and rejoice what God is doing here.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 We regard you as close personal friends.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 But...

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 But...

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 What I'm going to say today actually pains me.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Deeply.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I've been involved in church leadership for over 40 years.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And the biggest conflicts that I've witnessed in churches across the world,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 the one thing that has caused more arguments and done more collateral damage,

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 is worship in church.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Is worship in church.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Yeah, that's right. Worship in church.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Ironically, the very thing that should be uniting us

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 has often turned into what I call "worship wars".

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Did you ever hear the story about the pastor who wanted to move the piano from one side of the church to the other?

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 He knew he couldn't move it just in one Sunday.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 It wasn't a question of physical capability, but he knew it wouldn't go over well.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Everyone was used to the piano being on this side of the stage.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So instead of a shock and awe approach, the pastor decided to be patient.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Every Sunday he moved the piano just one inch.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Until eventually it was on the other side.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 When he finished, no one even noticed the change.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Now for me, growing up in, shall I say, more traditional churches,

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 all my life I've heard this issue brought up more times than I count.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I was told that rhythmic music, the pattern of sound, silence and emphasis in a song, was wrong.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 If it was in a minor key.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 If it was syncopated.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Or had a set of drums or any percussion instrument for that matter.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And of course guitars, especially electric guitars, were bad.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 It seemed that every person told me something different about where I should stand with music and why it was all potentially evil.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I think it's time to hit scripture, don't you?

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Look at these verses.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 This is Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 You know it well.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Jesus is describing true worship.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But the hour is coming and is now here when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 For the Father is seeking such people to worship him.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 God is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 But what is in spirit and truth?

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Is it a certain style of music, dress and/or liturgy?

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Is it a proper religious heritage or denominational affiliation?

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Is it a required volume of biblical knowledge?

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 We just sang "The Heart of Worship" by Matt Redman.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And I want to tell you the story behind this song.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Soul Survivor Church in the UK began its ministry in 1993 just outside of London in a place called Watford.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And was at the forefront of modern worship, what we call modern worship.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 They had innovative weekend services.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 They had worship arts production and active use of multimedia.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And they were all incorporated to make the church relevant to people's lives.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 But even with all of this, somehow over time, congregation members turned from active worship participants to silent connoisseurs.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Something amidst the music and the fervour was missing.

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 The lines got blurred and the heart of worship and praise was missing.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It was at this moment that Soul Survivor Church took drastic action.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 They removed everything from the worship services.

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 No microphones, no drums, no guitars, no sound systems were left.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Sundays had no worship leader, instruments or amplified sound.

61
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Could you imagine that? Could you imagine if you came today and there was none of that?

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 The attendees of this UK church couldn't at first.

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 But this is the point.

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 They had much more than powerful sound systems and eye-catching multimedia.

65
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And as soon as their voices were lifted together to God, as soon as their hearts were united in prayer, the silence disappeared.

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And the period of apathy was demolished.

67
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Now, step by step, the equipment was returned.

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 But since then, it has never played a more important role than people's voices.

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The worship pastor at that time, Matt Redman, wrote the song 'The Heart of Worship' during these unusual worship sessions.

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It was just his personal reflection of what was happening around him.

71
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 All of the stuff that was forming the story behind the song.

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And the result is the song we just sang.

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 When the music fades, all is stripped away.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I simply come, longing just to bring something that's of worth, that will bless your heart.

75
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And it's all about you, Jesus.

77
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 It's all about you.

78
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 The heart of worship is about self-examination, not only in matters of worship, but in our lives.

79
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 I need to tell you this.

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Jesus came into the world to build a people who would be true worshippers.

81
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Let me say it again.

82
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Jesus came into the world to build a people who would be true worshippers.

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 In the verses before our passage that I'm going to cover this morning,

84
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 we see the Pharisees. I love the Pharisees, don't you?

85
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 The religious people rejecting the one who called out to them.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 They were the religious people of the time.

87
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 Jesus said to them, "These people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 My goodness, we wouldn't want him saying that about the vineyard long this morning, right?

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 "Honor me with their lips, but their heart is..."

90
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Even Simon Peter failed to grasp exactly what was the heart of worship.

92
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And we read that Jesus said to him, "Peter said to him, 'Explain the parable to us.'

93
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And he, Jesus, said, 'Are you still without understanding?'"

94
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 You see, my friends, tradition is something external.

95
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 While God's truth is internal. It's in the heart.

96
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 People can obey tradition to please men and gain status.

97
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 But we obey the word to please God.

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Tradition deals with ritual.

99
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 While God's truth deals with reality.

100
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Tradition brings empty words to the lips.

101
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But truth penetrates the heart and changes the life.

102
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Actually, tradition potentially robs a person of the power of the word of God.

103
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And this incident with the religious leaders and the disciples is particularly significant.

104
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 As it sets up what happens next.

105
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Jesus takes radical action.

106
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Let's read this.

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 "And Jesus went away from there and withdrew from the people."

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 "And withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon."

109
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I've put a map on the screen.

110
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Jesus leaves the Galilee region.

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And he goes northwest to the coastal areas of Tyre and Sidon.

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Now, they're in modern day Lebanon.

113
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Just pause for a moment there.

114
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Lebanon is very much in the news today.

115
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And really just to ask you this week.

116
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Please pray for Lebanon and the situation in the Middle East.

117
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Now Tyre was about 35 miles from Capernaum.

118
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And Sidon was a 50 mile walk.

119
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Maybe this took 2 or 3 days.

120
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Now this is actually very significant.

121
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 This is the only time in Jesus' public ministry that he steps into strictly Gentile territory.

122
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Gentiles were the non-Jews, right?

123
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 This is the only recorded time that we have that Jesus stepped into strictly Gentile territory.

124
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Not only did Jesus teach that no foods were unclean.

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 But he practiced this by going into Gentile territory.

126
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 He was also seeking to refresh himself from the increasing conflicts.

127
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Especially with the religious people.

128
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And to withdraw a bit from the large crowds that were following him.

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And as he withdrew to a place of solitude.

130
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 He actually meets a woman with a true heart of worship.

131
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 He meets a woman with a true heart of worship.

132
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Mark 7 24 tells us that Jesus was actually trying to remain hidden.

133
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 He was on sabbatical, right?

134
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 But somehow this Canaanite woman heard where he was and came to her with his need.

135
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 But she wasn't what you expect.

136
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 She didn't tick all the boxes.

137
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 She wasn't baptized, confirmed.

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Leading a small group.

139
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Pillar of the church.

140
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Studying for a theology degree.

141
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 None of the above.

142
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 One writer has said there is no incident in our Lord's earthly ministry more puzzling than this.

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And so it begs investigation.

144
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I mean look at her entrance.

145
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 You've got it up there.

146
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And behold a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying.

147
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Have mercy on me, O Lord, son of David.

148
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 My daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.

149
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 She begins with a plea for mercy.

150
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 The cry, Lord have mercy, Kyrie eleison in Greek, has been described as the most prayed prayer in the Bible.

151
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 But notice she also calls Jesus the son of David.

152
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 A messianic term coming from the lips of a Gentile, a non-Jew.

153
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 She was clearly convinced about the person she was addressing.

154
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Now let's press in.

155
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Note the significance.

156
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Have mercy on me.

157
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Have mercy on me, O Lord.

158
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It was her daughter that was demon possessed.

159
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But it is the mom who feels the weight, the fear, the despair, the hopelessness.

160
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Any parent who's had teenagers would identify with this.

161
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And of course she was warmly welcomed by the disciples.

162
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Not! No way, Jose!

163
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Indeed their response was underwhelming to say the least.

164
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 But he, that's Jesus, did not answer her word.

165
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And his disciples came and begged him, "Send her away, for she's crying out after us."

166
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Now this really throws us off balance.

167
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 In Matthew 9 we read the story that Jairus was pleading for his little girl.

168
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And Jesus immediately takes steps to come to her aid.

169
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Now this woman comes to Jesus to seek mercy for her daughter.

170
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And Jesus seemingly ignores her and the disciples began a hostile counter-attack.

171
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 "Send her away, she's not one of us."

172
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 A marginalized woman becoming even more marginalized.

173
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Vineyard Long, there is a practical outreach for us, an outworking of this.

174
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 When we come to church we like to talk to our friends.

175
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Or with the dudes who are cool and popular.

176
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 But how do we react when it's a beggar?

177
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 A street sleeper? A drug addict?

178
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Or an LGBT member?

179
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Or someone from another generation?

180
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Or a different color?

181
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 It begs a serious question.

182
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 How does it feel when you are talking to someone and that person ignores you?

183
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Let's take it up a notch.

184
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 How does that feeling change when you factor in the importance of the person you are talking to?

185
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 When you talk to God about things, does it ever seem like he's ignoring you?

186
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Does it feel wonderful? I think not.

187
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 This woman is not just passing the time.

188
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 She's not commenting on the weather.

189
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Isn't it hot, right?

190
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 She's not commenting on the weather or the Hang Seng Index.

191
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 She has a demon possessed daughter.

192
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I mean, she needs help.

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And the person who can help her is standing right in front of her.

194
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 As Jesus' fame had grown, people from all over the region were drawn to him for help and rescue.

195
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 She'd obviously heard these stories and fuelled by the anguish for her daughter

196
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 she came to Jesus and bares her soul to him.

197
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I want you to picture the scene here.

198
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 The mum is shouting her head off.

199
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 The disciples were having their five cents worth.

200
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 On the other hand, Jesus was standing silently in the eye of the storm.

201
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Rather like he was on the Sea of Galilee before he calmed the storm.

202
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 The Canaanite woman must have felt like she was being put on hold.

203
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 No one likes to be put on hold, do they?

204
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I don't know about you, I really detest these so-called hotlines, which are not so hot.

205
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Our lines are very busy.

206
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Your call is important to us, yeah right.

207
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 So please hold on and one of our customer services representatives will be with you shortly.

208
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 That's a lie.

209
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And then we're subject to either canned music or a barrage of advertisements.

210
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 The dialogue then becomes even more difficult to understand.

211
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 He, Jesus, answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."

212
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Did Jesus really tell her he wouldn't help her because of her ethnicity?

213
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I mean we've had examples in the 20th century, haven't we?

214
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Churches in America, South Africa, no blacks allowed, you know we've had that.

215
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And no doubt the disciples were cheering in the background.

216
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 This is getting more puzzling by the moment.

217
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 But look at her response.

218
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 She came before him and knelt.

219
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 She knelt before him saying, "Lord, help me."

220
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 We cannot but admire the patience and the persistence of this Gentile mother.

221
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 "Lord, help me" was her next plea.

222
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 This time she avoided any messianic titles.

223
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 She came as a sinner needing help.

224
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And she offered no argument.

225
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 "Lord, help me."

226
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Now consider this.

227
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 This woman appears to have been ignored, rejected and insulted by Jesus.

228
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And still she comes forward and offers her worship to him.

229
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Surely, surely now Jesus will help this woman and her daughter.

230
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 But it gets even more intriguing.

231
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And if you can work this out, come and tell me afterwards.

232
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 And he, Jesus said, "It is not right to take children's bread and throw it to the dogs."

233
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 What?

234
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Just when you think things can't get any worse, Jesus appears to call her a dog.

235
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Now actually, in his reply, Jesus did not call her a dog in the way the Pharisees would have addressed a Gentile.

236
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 The Greek word here means a little pet dog.

237
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And not the filthy disease carrying mongrels that ran the streets and ate the garbage.

238
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 The children referred, of course, to the people of Israel.

239
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But I need to tell you, Jesus wasn't playing games with the woman.

240
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Nor was he trying to make the situation more difficult.

241
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 What he was trying to do is draw out of her a growing response of faith.

242
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 And she didn't disappoint.

243
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 This is one of my favorite verses.

244
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 She said, "Yes, Lord."

245
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 But even the dogs ate the crumbs that fall from their master's table.

246
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 She refuses to let go.

247
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 She immediately seized on the illustration about the children's bread, which was exactly what he wanted her to do.

248
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 We may paraphrase her reply.

249
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 It's true that we Gentiles do not sit at the table as children and eat the bread.

250
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 But even the pet dogs under the table can eat some of the crumbs.

251
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Now Sandra and I understand this.

252
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Our pet husky, Lexi, parks herself under our dining table at dinner time.

253
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Ready for the smallest crumb to drop from our plate.

254
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 But what a tremendous testimony of faith.

255
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 She was in effect saying, "I'll gladly accept the crumbs under your table.

256
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 But only if it is your table in your house.

257
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I've got no desire to deprive your children.

258
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Just let a crumb of grace fall to help my child.

259
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 I accept your invitation and I trust you to meet my need."

260
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 It was this faith that Jesus acknowledged.

261
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And immediately he healed her daughter.

262
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Then Jesus answered her, "Oh woman, how great is your faith.

263
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Be it done for you as you desire."

264
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And her daughter was healed instantly.

265
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 The question you might ask, "Why didn't you do that an hour ago?"

266
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It is worth noting that both of the people in the Gospel of Matthew

267
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 who were described as having great faith were Gentiles.

268
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 The Canaanite woman and the Roman centurion in Matthew 8.

269
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 In both cases, get this one, in both cases,

270
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Jesus healed the one in need from a distance.

271
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Now why? Because spiritually speaking, the Gentiles were far off until Calvary.

272
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 When Jesus died for both Jews and Gentiles and made reconciliation possible.

273
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 This woman's faith was great because she persisted in asking and trusting

274
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 when everything, everything seemed against her.

275
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Certainly her race was against her.

276
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 She was a Gentile.

277
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 Her sex was against her.

278
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 For most Jewish rabbis paid little attention to women.

279
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It seemed that the disciples were against her.

280
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And Christ's words might have led her to believe that even he was against her.

281
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 All of these obstacles only made her persist further.

282
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Now I've got a theory here.

283
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 This was bizarre, right? Totally bizarre.

284
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 This bizarre exchange was actually for the disciples.

285
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 This bizarre exchange was actually for the benefit of the disciples.

286
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 They had been brought up in a particular religious system.

287
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 It needed them to be taken out of their comfort zone.

288
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Their comfort zone of Palestine to find a new reference point

289
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 for what the heart of worship looks like.

290
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 It was more than being fascinated by his teaching or impressed by his miracles.

291
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 The appropriate response was humble faith and worship.

292
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And this Canaanite woman had demonstrated this heart clearly.

293
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 The next verse, verse 29, is very telling.

294
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee.

295
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Now most people would miss this because you would finish at verse 28.

296
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Look at what's happened.

297
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Jesus turns his men around and heads back to Galilee.

298
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Two to three days walk, only to immediately walk back another two to three days.

299
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Let me put this in context.

300
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 It was the equivalent of getting out of here at lunchtime,

301
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 walking to Guangzhou for dim sum lunch, because we all know it's better and cheaper there, right?

302
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Turning around and immediately walking back to Yuen Long.

303
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 My friends, I believe this was no random visit.

304
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Jesus had come for this woman and her daughter.

305
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Why?

306
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 Because he wanted to teach his disciples, for them to encounter a heart of worship.

307
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 He reached across both geographical, ethnic, religious and cultural boundaries to reach her.

308
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And to teach them.

309
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And what I've come this morning to tell you is this, I'll put it on the screen.

310
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 He wants to both reach us and to teach us.

311
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 He wants to both reach us and teach us.

312
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 The Father reached us by sending his Son.

313
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Jesus reached us by entering into everything we face and struggle with in life.

314
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Our response is to give him our worship and trust.

315
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 To give him our lives.

316
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Totally.

317
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 We're going to sing a response song in a moment.

318
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 If the band will just get ready in a moment.

319
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Going back to my first point about worship in church.

320
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 This song was not written in the past couple of years.

321
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 It was written 1896, 128 years ago.

322
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Look at some of the words we're going to be singing. I'll put them on the screen.

323
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 All to Jesus I surrender.

324
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 All to him I freely give.

325
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I will ever love and trust him.

326
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 In his presence daily live.

327
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 All to Jesus I surrender.

328
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Humbly at his feet I bow.

329
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken.

330
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Take me Jesus, take me now.

331
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I surrender all.

332
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 All means all.

333
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 I surrender all.

334
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 All to thee my blessed Saviour.

335
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 I surrender all.

336
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 I'm going to invite you to do something different this morning.

337
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I want to invite you to be like the King and the Night Woman.

338
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Come before Jesus.

339
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And kneel before him. We don't do that in church very often, do we?

340
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I'm going to challenge you this morning. If you're unable to physically kneel, that's okay.

341
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I'm going to challenge us to kneel.

342
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And say, "Lord, have mercy on me."

343
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 As we sing this song together.

344
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And I want to speak to anybody here this morning who is not yet following Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour.

345
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 This is your opportunity now.

346
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 To come and give your life to Jesus Christ.

347
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 And I'm going to invite you as we kneel.

348
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 As we kneel before the throne. As we say, "Lord, have mercy."

349
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 As we sing this beautiful old song.

350
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 To kneel and to give your life to Jesus Christ.

351
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 And if you do that, speak to somebody afterwards and we'd love to pray for you.

352
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 So church, Yearn Long Church, this is a time of rededication for us.

353
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 If you're happy to do that, I'm probably one of the oldest here.

354
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 It's going to be more difficult for me to kneel than anybody.

355
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 If you'd like to join me in kneeling, we'll sing this song together.
