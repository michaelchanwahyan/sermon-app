00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 (Applause)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 "Swing Low," written by Wallace Willis in the late 1800s,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 made more popular in the 1900s by a group of African-American singers

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 called the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 This song has been around for a while in its transcended genre.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 It's been sung by Dolly Parton, it's been sung by Johnny Cash,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 it's been sung by the Beatles,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 it's been sung by Johnny Cash, it's been sung by Alicia Keys.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And the reason people sing this song is because of the themes in the song.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 The song is a bit of a retelling,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 emphasizing on certain parts of the story of Elijah.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Now, Elijah is my personal favorite Bible character.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I've named my son Elias after him.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 The story of Elijah is of a prophet who is taken from Earth.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And the chariot swings low and carries him to Heaven.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Themes of hope.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 That's why this song was sung.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 But see, the singers of this song, African-American slaves,

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 actually sung it for multiple reasons.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 One of the other reasons was that it was a bit of a code,

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 it was hidden language.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 See, the idea of "Swinging Low" was a reference to the fact that Harriet Tubman,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 a woman who was known for helping slaves escape the South

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 via the Underground Railroad, would be close.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And so African-American slaves would sing this

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 as a way of communicating to one another

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 without letting their oppressors know

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 that there was a chance that they could escape to rest that very night.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 "Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home."

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You can see that this song is pretty weighty.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 It's pretty powerful lyrics, both to the singer and to those listening.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 A song speaking of hope, of a future peace, of a future rest for people.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 "Coming for to carry me home."

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 In these lyrics, home is not just the place you go to rest, to sleep,

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 to lay your head down.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 No, home is a place that is providing you freedom from conflict,

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 freedom from oppression, freedom from death and pain.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's a place of actual rest.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 See, this is a song that was sung by people done wrong, but unbroken,

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 by the land they lived in, weary from the oppression of their circumstances,

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 but still pointing their hope towards a future rest from their oppressors,

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 towards a future restoration of their dignity.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 This was a song of rest for the restless,

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 a song for all of those who were truly weary.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 The second song we look at over this Advent series

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 comes from a guy who sings it, but ironically enough,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 a few seconds before, it had been mute for a long time.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 He's a well-educated man.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 He's grown up knowing the Scriptures extensively.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 An older man who's been serving God his whole life,

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 which would mean that he would have witnessed the deterioration of his homeland

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 while waiting for God to fulfill a promise.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 He's a man of God from the tribe of Levi.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 He's a priest wrestling with the tensions of seeing his people suffer for so long.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 He would have known the promises that one day a Messiah would come and rescue them,

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 but he hadn't seen it yet.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 This man was Zechariah, the priest.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 See, Zechariah wasn't a marginalized individual.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He wasn't on the outskirts of society.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 He would have been someone that would have been seen as a bit more of a prestigious fellow,

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 had a sense of honor,

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 but yet he too felt the same oppression that people like Mary

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 that we talked about last week would have been feeling and singing about.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The first story we get of Zechariah is of him doubting the Word of God,

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 which is odd because I guess when I think about it,

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Zechariah is a priest.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 I was thinking of this yesterday.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I'm like, "Man, if I were a priest and I'd been serving God for a long time,

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 and it's like, 'Oh, your name gets to be in the Bible,

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 and the story's going to be written about you,'

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I would hope it would be about something other than my doubt."

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But this is Zechariah's case.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 See, Zechariah is in a bit of a predicament.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 He's an older guy, and he and his wife are without child.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 They've been wanting a child for a while.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 But there's been this prayer and these prayers and these prayers,

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 and God has done nothing.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 He has failed to act.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It's like God has been silent.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 So one day Zechariah goes to fulfill his priestly duties of lighting incense

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 in the holiest place in the temple.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And an angel appears to him and says, "Zechariah, good news.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 You and your wife are going to have a kid.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 God has heard your prayers.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 We should be rejoicing you."

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And Zechariah is any critical-thinking, rational individual.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 His first thought is, "I'm a bit old."

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 You know, like, you know, if you're later down the road,

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 that's probably not what you're thinking is about having a kid

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 when you're in your 70s, 80s, or 90s.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 That's the space that Zechariah is in.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And an angel says, "You're going to have a kid."

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He's first thinking, "Yeah, that's probably not possible, mate."

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 It puts him in this position of doubt

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 because he's been praying for so long,

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 waiting for God to answer this prayer, and it hasn't happened.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He's probably reflecting, thinking, "Man, God,

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 if you really wanted to step in and do a miracle,

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 why didn't you hit me up in my 30s and 40s?"

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 That would have been the perfect time for you to show up and do a miracle.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 So this is a prayer that's been unanswered,

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 much like the bigger prayer that him and his people

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 have been praying for salvation

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 while they remain under a deeply oppressive system.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 See, Zechariah's faith was weary. He was tired.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And that happens to us sometimes, too.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 We, too, get tired. We, too, get weary.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Sometimes faith is a thing of endurance,

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 and our circumstances can impact our stamina.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 This was the case for Zechariah,

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 and neither him nor his father or his father's father's generations before

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 had been waiting for a while for this promise to be fulfilled,

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 for God to act on their behalf,

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 when nothing had happened yet.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And so in his little altercation with the angel--

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 the angel makes a bit of an example out of him--

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 the angel takes away his ability to speak for the next nine months,

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 and Zechariah would sit and would have to think and process for a bit.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And, you know, what the angel says comes true.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 His wife Elizabeth is pregnant, has a child,

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 and they're all wondering, "What are you going to name the baby?

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 What are you going to name the baby?"

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And Elizabeth is like, "Oh, we'll name him John."

124
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And they look at Zechariah, thinking, "That surely can't be the name.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Why John?"

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And so they look at Zechariah, and they're like, "What are we going to name him?"

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And he writes it down.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And to their surprise, when he holds up the sheet of paper, it says "John."

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And immediately his voice comes back.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And the first thing he does, a bit different than when he was doubting--

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 the last time he spoke, he was doubting the angel's word.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 This time, as his voice comes back, we look at Luke 1, 67, and he says this.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 "His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 and prophesied, 'Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 because he has come to his people and redeemed them.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 He has raised up a horn of salvation in the house of his servant David,

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 as he said he would through the prophets of long ago.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Salvation from our enemies and from the hands of all those who hate us,

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 the oath he swore to our father Abraham, to rescue us from the hands of our enemies

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 and to enable us to serve him without fear and holiness and righteousness

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 before him all of our days.'"

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 See, this is the first thing that comes out of Zechariah after nine months of stewing.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Within this song, I believe there's some pretty compelling truths

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 that show us a couple of things about rest,

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 about how we can be at rest in this current moment,

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 regardless of what's going on, and how we can find rest,

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 where to look, where to turn our eyes if we are in need of rest.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And I would think this is pretty relevant to a lot of us.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 The past couple of years in Hong Kong hasn't been the most restful.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 When you do your reflection back on the year in a couple of weeks

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 around New Year's Eve and you're celebrating,

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 if someone asks you how their year's going,

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 your guess is that I doubt you'll say it's just been a real restful year.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And so this passage has something to show each of us about what rest looks like,

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 because we long for rest.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 We were made to live within that shalom and that wholeness that God offers us.

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And Zechariah, after not speaking for months, still in this system,

159
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 nothing has changed about the big picture.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Let's get that straight.

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 It's not like nine months later, all of a sudden, all the oppression is just gone.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 No, nine months later, his baby has come,

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 and the Holy Spirit comes upon him, fills him,

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 and he sings that God has come.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 He sings that there is rest.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And I think as we look into this, we can find for ourselves what rest looks like

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 and how we can enter into it.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 So Zechariah's song opens with praises.

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 He praises God because he has come.

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And that's what this whole season's all about, right?

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Like God has come to his people.

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 That's the whole idea of Advent, the waiting for God to come.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And Zechariah opens his mouth and says, "God has come."

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It's been just nine months ago.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Zechariah was doubting that God would do the very thing he promised to do,

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 and that was a bit of a smaller thing compared to the bigger scale picture.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 He was doubting the words of the angel, but now Zechariah is saying,

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 "God has come. God is here. Hallelujah, he's here."

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Like this has been 1,600 years of prophecy unfulfilled,

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 of people desperately longing for some type of salvation,

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 for God to come and to save them from their oppression,

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 and Zechariah is saying, "God is here."

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 We look at the verse again, and he said,

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 "Through his prophets, holy prophets of long ago,

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us,

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 to show mercy to our ancestors and to remember his holy covenant,

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 the oath he swore to our father Abraham."

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 See, this was a bit of an old, old promise, an old covenant made a long time ago.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Many have come, many have passed, and it's not happened yet.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And we've all been in that position as well, where something was promised a while ago,

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 and we've been waiting, and we've been waiting, and we find ourselves,

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 it's been so long that we doubt that the promise was even made, more or less,

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 that it would ever come through.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 This would be the state of the audience that Zechariah would be singing and prophesying to.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 The Jewish people, that's where they would be.

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 So, in Zechariah's first line, that God has come,

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 he's actually offering them his first way of finding rest.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And what is that rest, you might ask?

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It's this, we can rest assured that God has remembered his promise.

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I mean, we're just saying that, right?

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 The promise still stands.

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 No mountain, no walls, like, the promise still stands.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Advent is our reminder of a God who has heard his people,

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 who has been faithful to his word, who doesn't say one thing and does another.

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But a God who remembers his promise.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He hadn't forgotten about his people.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And this is funny, this is like the second time this has happened.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 See, if we look back in scripture, we look at the Exodus story,

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 these people are under oppression for 400 years underneath a deeply oppressive system,

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 similar to the way that they are in the first century.

211
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And they think God hasn't heard them, but he breaks into their silence,

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 and he sends them Moses to rescue them.

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 But this time it'd be a little different.

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 God's not sending Moses.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 He's not sending an Elijah.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 No, God himself is coming into the brokenness, into the systems of oppression,

217
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 into our darkness, to be with us.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And today we can rest assured because our God keeps his promise.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 His promise still stands.

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 His words are still true today.

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 We think about how, for a lot of us, a promise can feel conditional.

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 When we make a promise to someone or we say we'll do something,

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 it's depending on, well, in the next eight years or over this period of time.

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 This promise was made 1,600 years previous.

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 The state of the people of Israel had changed.

226
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 They had gone from being a nation that was following God, and God kept his promise,

227
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 to being a nation that fell into idolatry, but yet God still keeps his promise.

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 A nation that was given God's presence in the Ark of the Covenant

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 and lost it in their unfaithfulness, but God chooses to still keep his promise.

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 A nation that had been unfaithful, following after God,

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 placing their faith in other things, in themselves, and God chooses to be faithful.

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 A nation under foreign occupation and the people are losing hope

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 about whether God hears them, doubting if he's even there,

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 just going through the rhythms and the routines without meaning any of it.

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And God keeps his promise.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 There's something to hold onto here.

237
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 God will keep his promise.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 He keeps his word, independent of how we failed, doubted, or forgotten him.

239
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 That's just the God we serve.

240
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He's consistent. He's not going to waver.

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 If he says yes, it'll be yes.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And I know, God is looking for us, yes,

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 to be people who desire to live a faithful Christian life committed to him.

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 But the reality is we will have those moments of doubt.

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 We will have those moments where we fall short.

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And how we can be at rest is to know that God isn't changing in that time.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 His promise still stands. He still keeps his promise.

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And if God could keep his promise to a broken nation

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 that has strayed so far from where they once were,

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 that had lost their knowledge of him, had lost their spark,

251
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 if he could keep his promise and come into that space

252
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 and be with that people,

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 then there's no situation that you're in.

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 There's no darkness that you're in.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 There's no shame that you can carry that's too shameful.

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 There's no hurt beyond what he can step into.

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 If he can enter a nation that would barely recognize him,

258
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 he can step into your space today.

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 He's come for the righteous, for the sinners.

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 He's come for those who believe.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He's faithful to those who don't yet believe.

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 This is why Zachariah is singing and rejoicing,

263
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 because you can find rest in this.

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 You don't have to worry about,

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 "Is God going to change his mind on me?

266
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Is God still going to love me? Is God still God?"

267
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 He is faithful. He keeps his promise. He keeps his word.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And that is why Zachariah sings,

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 because he has come to his people and redeemed them."

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 God has kept his promise.

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Zachariah continues after explaining

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 that God is worthy of praise because he keeps his word

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 no matter what happens.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 God keeps his word.

276
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 He continues and lays out a second understanding

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 of what rest could look like.

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Rest based off of the understanding

279
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 that God has this mission that is massive.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 When you understand the mission of God,

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 what he's up to in the world,

282
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 it can bring you to rest.

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And it reads like this,

284
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 "Salvation from our enemies,

285
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 from the hand of all those who hate us

286
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 to show mercy to our ancestors,

287
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 to remember his holy covenant,

288
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 the oath he swore to our father Abraham,

289
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 to rescue us, to rescue us

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 from the hands of our enemies."

291
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 God's agenda is about saving people.

292
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It's about rescuing a lost people,

293
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 a people in need of hope and in need of rest.

294
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 See, this idea of salvation is a loaded, complex topic.

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Pastor Andrew broke into it last week

296
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 when he looked at Mary's song of salvation.

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 But you have to understand, like he said,

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 salvation to the Jews isn't,

299
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 their first century Jewish people

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 aren't thinking about the cross and eternity.

301
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 They're actually just thinking about right now.

302
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Like we need salvation from this.

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 This moment is hard.

304
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 We need salvation from here.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Salvation from our enemies.

306
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 That was a package deal that came

307
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 with some sensitive and deep expectations

308
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 because the people had real enemies.

309
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 They had been taken over by the Babylonians and destroyed,

310
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 taken over by the Persians and exiled,

311
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 now under foreign occupation by the Romans.

312
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 They had needs.

313
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 They needed saving.

314
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And they'd been crying out for years.

315
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And so it's because of this reason

316
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 they would start to see their salvation

317
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 to mean the removal of the present struggle that I'm in,

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 the current issue.

319
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 That's what God's salvation.

320
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 When they would hear this,

321
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 they would think salvation means this.

322
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But actually the angel would mean something a little different.

323
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 It's critical that we don't miss this.

324
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 God's salvation has a bigger impact

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 on our eternal condition

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 than just the removal of our present trouble.

327
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I'm going to say that one more time.

328
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 God's salvation has a bigger impact

329
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 on your eternal condition

330
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 than just the removal of your current struggle.

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 That's the salvation Zachariah is singing about.

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Salvation of the spiritual type.

333
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Salvation through the removal of the threat

334
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 that anything or anyone can ever pose on you

335
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 and make you prisoner to or subject to.

336
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That salvation is an eternal rest.

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It's a long-term thing.

338
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 God has kept his promise and he offers us that salvation,

339
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 changing the trajectory of you and my eternity.

340
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Playing a long game,

341
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 putting us in position

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 to choose an eternity of rest with him,

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 of shalom,

344
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 which means we're able to navigate

345
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 through the situations we're in currently.

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 See, we can work through just about anything,

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 just about anything,

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 when we know that we've been saved

349
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and that there is an eternal rest for us.

350
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 When we know how the book ends,

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 we read it more confidently.

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And the story ends.

353
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 What salvation would mean is that the story ends

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 with God rescuing us forever

355
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 and us being with him

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 in that type of eternal rest.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 See, God brings about a salvation

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 affecting the condition of the soul,

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 shifting humanity's eternal position

360
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 and restoring us back to him.

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 God's salvation isn't temporary,

362
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 but our temporary current struggles are.

363
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And that's something to really think about.

364
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 The salvation he's offering us through this

365
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 isn't gonna burn out,

366
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 isn't gonna stop working,

367
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 isn't gonna grow old,

368
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 isn't gonna fail and wither.

369
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 But the current tensions that we sit in,

370
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 the current struggles of today

371
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 may only last today,

372
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 may only last this year.

373
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 See, God's salvation changes our perspective

374
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 on what's eternal and what's not.

375
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 His salvation makes sure that our eternity

376
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 can be filled with rest.

377
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It's an eternity of restoration,

378
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 an eternity of shalom.

379
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 That eternity is promised to us,

380
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 and it's something like this,

381
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 where our tears are wiped away,

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 where there's no more shame,

383
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 where no more weeping,

384
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 no more sorrow, no more death,

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 where we're no longer striving,

386
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 where we're no longer thwarted by our enemies,

387
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 to where fear and death can no longer alter

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 who we're called and who we're meant to be.

389
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 This is the eternal rest that God's mission,

390
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 God's salvation is speaking to.

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 This is what Zachariah is singing about.

392
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 In Advent, this season that we're in,

393
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 is the starting point.

394
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 It's when God steps into the world

395
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and begins his plan of salvation.

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It's where the rubber would meet the road.

397
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And I think it's seeing this and understanding this,

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 that Zachariah is possessed with song,

399
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 to where as soon as he gets a chance to,

400
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 he sings praises to God,

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 because God has come to rescue us,

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 to bring us salvation.

403
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Regardless of our trouble,

404
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 God comes and he offers you and me

405
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 a salvation that goes beyond just today,

406
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 goes beyond just the temporary obstacles that we can see,

407
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 a salvation that covers all.

408
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 He comes to offer us an eternal rest.

409
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Zachariah wraps up his passage,

410
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 his song, his singing,

411
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 by hitting on a really big topic about rest,

412
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 which kind of is a bit of the big story of scripture.

413
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 From both Genesis all the way to Revelation,

414
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 we see this concept woven in between the stories

415
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 and the principles and the precepts.

416
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 The very last line of this passage says this,

417
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 "To enable us to serve him without fear,

418
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 "in holiness and righteousness,

419
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 "before him all of our days."

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Without fear.

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 It's a beautiful condition

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and a hard thing for us to step into.

423
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 See, for all of human history,

424
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 from Genesis 3 onward,

425
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 there's been this continual pursuit

426
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 to regain what was lost,

427
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 and what was lost.

428
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It was a space where humanity could live without fear,

429
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 could live full and live whole.

430
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That was the Garden of Eden,

431
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 a state of all perfect harmony.

432
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 It's promised again in Revelation chapter 22.

433
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 We see Eden restored,

434
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 so that all of us, all of creation,

435
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 can enter once again into this rest

436
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 that comes without fear.

437
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 The people of God would spend the majority of their time

438
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 chasing after this,

439
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 a rest that looks like a freedom from their enemies,

440
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 a restoration and a peace.

441
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 I think it's because rest looks like the existence,

442
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 our existence without fear,

443
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 it makes it really easy for the people

444
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 to see what Zachariah is talking about

445
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 and to see that the only way that's possible

446
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 is if they were in a specific situation

447
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 or if things looked a certain way.

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 For them, if they were in their land with no oppressors,

449
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 then they had no reason to be afraid.

450
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 So they started seeing rest based off of their land,

451
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 based off of their circumstance.

452
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Their rest had become dependent

453
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 on things going a certain way,

454
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 on the stability of their land,

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 on the way that their country was set up,

456
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 on what they deemed necessary

457
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 to actually enter into rest.

458
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 All the while, God is promising to send a Messiah

459
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 who's going to come and set the captives free,

460
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 but in their situation,

461
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 they still have all this oppression,

462
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 so how can they be at rest?

463
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 The people were looking for God

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 to come and shift a geopolitical landscape.

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 They were looking for him to come and change the settings

466
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 and the conditions of their land.

467
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 God was actually coming to change the settings

468
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 and the conditions of their heart.

469
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 See, they were looking in the wrong place.

470
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 They were missing it.

471
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And I think we too can find ourselves

472
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 weary and exhausted and restless

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 when we spend our time looking for a good thing,

474
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 looking for the right thing,

475
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 but in the wrong place.

476
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 See, yesterday I went on a walk,

477
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 like pastors do,

478
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 and took my notes with me,

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 and I was going to read through my sermon,

480
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 prepare, internalize it.

481
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And in order for that to happen,

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I knew I needed a couple of things.

483
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 The first thing I needed was my fanny pack.

484
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 So I clipped on my Nike fanny pack,

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 getting ready to step out the door.

486
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Had my AirPods and my fanny pack

487
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 so I could listen to some music.

488
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Then I had my camera.

489
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I actually don't know why I had my camera.

490
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I just felt like I needed to take it with me.

491
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So I'm walking out the door.

492
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I get to the lift, press the button, go out, start walking.

493
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I live in Chukwuno,

494
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 so there's a beautiful little harborfront area.

495
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 I'm walking by the promenade.

496
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 It's great.

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And I'm getting ready to get into the zone

498
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 to read this sermon and really hear from God.

499
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I'm like, "You know what I need?

500
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 "I need some good preacher music,

501
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 "some good Jesus worship music."

502
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So I'm like, "All right, let me get my headphones out."

503
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 So I open my fanny pack,

504
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 pull out my little white case of my AirPods,

505
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 and it's empty.

506
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 (audience laughs)

507
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 That's not really how the story was supposed to go.

508
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 So I'm like, "Okay, fine, it must be in my pocket."

509
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Because I do make that mistake every so often.

510
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I put something where it doesn't belong.

511
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 My wife gets on to me quite a lot about it, and she's right.

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 And this was a great example of it.

513
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 So I'm like, "You know what?

514
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 "If it's not in my AirPods, maybe it's in my pocket."

515
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 So I start searching my pocket, searching my back pocket.

516
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I have a jacket on, so I'm searching that pocket.

517
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 That has another pocket inside.

518
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I'm searching every possible pocket that's available,

519
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 and there's no AirPods in them.

520
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And I'm starting to get pretty annoyed

521
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 and pretty frustrated and pretty restless

522
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 because all I need to really hit that zone

523
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 of me and God in this sermon is some good music,

524
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 and I'm so close.

525
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I've got my phone,

526
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 but I can't just play it loud.

527
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 It's not gonna work.

528
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 So it hits me.

529
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I just don't have my AirPods,

530
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 so I guess I have to go back home.

531
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 So frustrated promise is just walking back,

532
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 moping head down, pretty frustrated,

533
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 uttering all sorts of ridiculousness under his breath.

534
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And I--like, my ears feel funny.

535
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 So I take my hand, and I do this.

536
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And guess where my AirPods were.

537
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 [laughter]

538
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Silly.

539
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 It's sitting right in my ears.

540
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I had gone through this whole range of emotion

541
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 because my AirPods were in my ears.

542
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 But how often is that the case with us,

543
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 where we're looking for something in the wrong place?

544
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 What does that do to us spiritually

545
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 when we look for rest in the wrong place?

546
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 That's the very source of our restlessness.

547
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Can I break it down for us?

548
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Rest isn't gonna be found in a nation or in a country

549
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 or in a virus-free world.

550
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 It's not gonna be found in a better bank account statement.

551
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 It's not gonna be found in--name it.

552
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 That rest isn't situational or circumstantial.

553
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 And when we seek these circumstances,

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 maybe a better strategy,

555
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 maybe a better 2022 list of goals,

556
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 then I'll be at rest.

557
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 You won't enter into lasting rest that way.

558
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 It's not how it was designed.

559
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 No, rest couldn't be found in the land for the Jewish people

560
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 because it was never in the land.

561
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Rest is salvific.

562
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 It's based off of salvation,

563
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 off of something that only God can offer us,

564
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 a restoration of what is broken.

565
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Rest is the releasing of our extraneous efforts

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 to earn God's favor.

567
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It's God ridding us of having to live in fear of our sin,

568
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 of our enemies, of anything.

569
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Rest is the state where the condition of our world

570
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 doesn't distort our holiness or righteousness,

571
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 but rather we are free to serve him and to know him.

572
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 This is Zachariah's song.

573
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 This is, like, the pinnacle of what he's saying.

574
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Free from fear, what rest really looks like.

575
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 So we get weary looking for rest in all the wrong places,

576
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 like I was looking for my AirPods in all the wrong places.

577
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 So I guess the logical question is where do you actually look?

578
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Where is the right place?

579
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Cool, you've listed nine places, promise, where I can't find rest.

580
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Give me one place where I can find it.

581
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Thank you for asking that question.

582
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I will give you one place.

583
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Rest is only found in what we celebrate in this Advent season.

584
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 That's why this passage is here.

585
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 See, Advent is the anticipation, the longing, the waiting,

586
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 and the receiving of Jesus Christ.

587
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Born in a manger in a most humble of positions,

588
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 that's actually where we're going to find our rest.

589
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 It's not going to be in the state of things.

590
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 It's going to be in him.

591
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Rest would be a baby born in a manger.

592
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Rest would be Jesus who grew up and would say

593
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 one of the most beautiful things in scripture.

594
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 He would say this, "Come to me."

595
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 He's calling, "Come unto me, all of you who are weary,

596
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "heavy laden, restless," use whatever translation you want.

597
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 "If you've got stuff, come to me, and I will give you rest."

598
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Not, "I will tell you where to go to get rest."

599
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 "I won't give you money, that'll give you rest."

600
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 "I won't give you a more perfect land, and that'll give you rest."

601
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 No, "I'll give you me."

602
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 The idea is this, rest can only be found in Jesus.

603
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 That's because rest is not a place, it's a person.

604
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Jesus won't point you somewhere to find your rest.

605
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 No, he'll say, "Come, follow me.

606
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 "If you've got stuff, that's okay.

607
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 "Come to me, all of you who are weary,

608
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 "all of you who are in chains, and I will give you rest."

609
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Rest without fear, rest that allows you to serve him

610
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 in holiness and in righteousness, free from fear.

611
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 And wouldn't we love that?

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 That's the reason Zachariah sings.

613
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 That's the reason Jesus comes to earth.

614
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 That's the reason we celebrate Advent.

615
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 We, his people, celebrate the remembering of a God

616
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 who keeps promises.

617
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 His promise still stands.

618
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 A God whose plan to save us is not just to save us

619
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 from today and today's troubles,

620
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 but has a longer, bigger picture, bigger than we think.

621
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Man, the worship set was right on, guys.

622
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Well done.

623
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 Advent is a season calling us, those of us who are restless,

624
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 those of us who are weary, to come and follow him,

625
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 because that's how we're going to find our rest.

626
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 That's the only way we can live, free from fear,

627
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 free from the bondage that sin and that life can put on us.

628
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 So here's my pitch, here's the thing.

629
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 I know we're tired, I'm tired, it's been a hard year for me too.

630
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I'm exhausted.

631
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 A lot of us here at the Vine are actually weary,

632
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 we're actually restless.

633
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 We can't make a light of the challenges that the people

634
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 in Hong Kong have faced in the past two years.

635
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 People around the world are facing with this virus.

636
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And because of those challenges,

637
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 it might seem like rest is impossible.

638
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 It might seem like if rest exists,

639
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 it might just be right out of my reach.

640
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And what we so desperately need is a kind of rest

641
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 that allows us to remember that God keeps his promise,

642
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 a rest that then brings a confidence to us.

643
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 What us weary people need is a rest that shows us the eternal,

644
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 the big picture of what God is doing,

645
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 even when we can't see it,

646
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 even when our situation hasn't changed right before our eyes,

647
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 what he's doing internally and eternally.

648
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 A rest that will combat our fears,

649
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 delivering us from the threat and the hold and the grip

650
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 that our enemies, that our sin, that our shame,

651
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 that our insecurities have on us,

652
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 and render their impact as ineffective against our soul.

653
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 So maybe you're here today and you fall into that category.

654
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Maybe you would say my life feels like,

655
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 characterized by incessant fear.

656
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Maybe it's fear of the future,

657
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 fear of this next wave of the virus,

658
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 fear of not being fully in control of your life,

659
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 fear of not getting the job that you wanted,

660
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 just name it.

661
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 All of those impact us and take a toll on us,

662
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 but the good news today is that in Jesus,

663
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 we can be free from those fears.

664
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 He can show us how to live without those things

665
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 distorting our view, without those things oppressing us,

666
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 without those things breaking us down from the inside.

667
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 So if you're tired and you're weary,

668
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 if you're broken, if you're hopeless,

669
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 if you got stuff, that's okay.

670
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 He doesn't say only come to me if you're perfect.

671
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 He says come to me if you're tired.

672
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 If you're weary, great, come to me.

673
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 If you're restless, okay, come to me.

674
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 If you've got a bunch of stuff, come to me.

675
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 And in that coming to him, there's this beautiful exchange.

676
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 Where God actually swaps some things.

677
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 See, he takes your burden, he takes your shame,

678
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 the things that are holding you,

679
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 that are freezing you from being who you're meant to be,

680
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 the fear that we can live in, he actually takes that.

681
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And in place of that, he gives you something else.

682
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 He gives you his rest, and that rest

683
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 is what allows us to walk daily with him.

684
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 It shows up in things like courage when we don't have it,

685
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 strength when we feel weak, hope when all seems lost.

686
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 All these fruit of the spirit, self-control and patience

687
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 and gentleness when things aren't gentle around us.

688
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 That's what entering into his rest can do for us.

689
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 When we exchange what we have for what he is,

690
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 he allows these things to bud in us,

691
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 bringing us into a space where we can be full of rest,

692
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 free from fear, and in wholeness.

693
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 May this Advent season lead us into a place

694
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 of deeper rest with Christ,

695
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 born unto us so that we will know him

696
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 and that we will know rest.

697
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 Let's stand and we'll pray.

698
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 (pages rustling)

699
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 God, your words are true.

700
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Your words are good, and your words say

701
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 that you keep your word, you keep your promise.

702
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 So God, we just come before you today

703
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 as people with various things on our heart,

704
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 various things that impact who we are.

705
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And we come to a promise keeping God,

706
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 knowing that if you did it then,

707
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 if you kept your word then, you'll keep your word to us.

708
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 God, we thank you for Advent.

709
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 We thank you for Jesus coming and being with us.

710
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 We thank you that your plan for our salvation

711
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 isn't just for right now.

712
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 God, thank you that you care about tomorrow as well.

713
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Thank you that your plan is well thought of.

714
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And God, we find ourselves in this space of restlessness

715
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 when we seek after sometimes good things,

716
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 but in the wrong places.

717
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 God, some of us are tired looking for good things

718
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 in the wrong places and not finding it.

719
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And I just pray, Lord, that your spirit

720
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 will come and minister to us,

721
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 will redirect our efforts,

722
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 not to a thing, not to a location,

723
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 not to a setting or a circumstance, Lord,

724
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 but through your spirit, will you turn our eyes,

725
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 shift our perspective,

726
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 and allow us to follow you more closely.

727
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And God, we ask for your rest.

728
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 We know that you know what it's been like.

729
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 We know because you came and you have felt it all

730
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 and you've walked in oppression and you've been there.

731
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 And so God, from the sin that entangles us,

732
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 we ask for your rest.

733
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 For the personal deep insecurities that plague us

734
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 from being who you call us to be,

735
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 we ask for your rest.

736
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 For the brokenness in our homes and in our families,

737
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 relationships where things just aren't as they're meant to be,

738
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 we ask for your spirit and for your rest.

739
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 May your presence come.

740
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 May your spirit work in us, Lord.

741
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 And may you lead us to a place

742
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 where we can live in that rest that you so freely give.

743
