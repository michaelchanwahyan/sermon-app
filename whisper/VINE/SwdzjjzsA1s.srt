1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 If you've just joined us, whether you've just joined us online or you just joined us right now,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,600
 just welcome again to the 11am service.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,500
 I'm Justin, I'm one of the pastors here.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,300
 I have a few announcements as always.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,500
 I think they're important.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,700
 From our perspective, they're all important.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,100
 But you discern what is the best for you and you just lean into that.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,300
 Yeah, and just the first thing, I think all of us go through different seasons.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:38,300
 And for those of us who are in the season of wanting to give, you want to get more involved.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,800
 You're ready to get involved.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,000
 You have the capacity.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 You have the time.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Last week, Pastor Carla dropped a magic number.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,700
 Do you guys remember what this number is?

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:56,600
 How many people does it take to run and to make sure that we can have church service?

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,000
 Do you guys remember the number?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,100
 90.

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,400
 I learned something new last week and I'm sure we did.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,700
 I think there's a silence in the room when you said 90.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,100
 You know, and that's the reality.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,300
 And so I just want to call you who are longing to serve, you want to serve.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,200
 There's a lot of ways.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
 You know, we have worship team, production team.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,800
 We, you know, the friendly faces you see downstairs, those checking us in every week, making sure

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,200
 that we can just be here.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,300
 K4C, if you love kids, if you want to get involved somehow, we would love for you just

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,400
 to email us.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,000
 Let us know, like reflect to us what your gift things are, who you might want to talk

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,300
 to and we are going to do our best to connect you as soon as we can.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,600
 Another thing is, do you guys know what happened this Wednesday?

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,900
 Who was online Wednesday from 7.30 to 10-ish?

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,600
 Minus Andrew.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,000
 I know Andrew was there.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
 So what happened this Wednesday?

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
 We had Alpha.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:04,500
 Yes, we launched Alpha and Alpha is a world, world, I don't know, it's just held everywhere,

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,000
 every part of the world, wherever there's Christians.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,200
 This is a great eight to, is it, how many weeks is this?

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,400
 Eight weeks where we get to explore the basics of the Christian faith.

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,500
 And this is actually not just for people who don't know Christ, although it is very geared

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,100
 towards us, but at the same time, it's for us to revisit the things that we deem important

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,600
 in our faith.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,300
 And so it's actually not too late to join.

44
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,600
 If you have friends, colleagues, you want to come together, please sign up and join

45
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
 us this Wednesday.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,600
 And this week, we heard testimonies of some of you who opened up your home and you invited

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 some colleagues, you invited some neighbors in your hood and you attended Alpha together

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 and afterwards, I heard that you guys had very meaningful, surprising, but very transformative

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,400
 conversation.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,100
 So we want to encourage that.

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,200
 God is a creative God.

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,700
 You guys are creative, so we'll figure it out, right?

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:06,000
 Another thing, as a parent, I'm very happy to announce that Flight, our youth ministry,

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,700
 our time with youth is relaunching today officially, symbolically, practically, physically,

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,600
 anything you want.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 So Pastor Grace, you want to say hi?

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
 I just want to, if you haven't met, this is Grace.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,200
 Yeah, so Grace is with us in this season and her heart is for our youth.

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,500
 So if you are a parent to a 12-year-old or a tween or a youth, and today is the perfect

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,800
 day to come to the relaunch.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,600
 So what we're going to do is we are going to have a paper plane competition in Wanchai

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,100
 Park after this service.

63
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,500
 More information if you scan it.

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,100
 And yeah, this is a great way actually for our kids to see if this is a place where they

65
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,000
 want to grow in.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,600
 And this is for you parents, a place where come meet other parents, come meet Pastor

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,800
 Grace, and I'm sure it's going to be a very fun time.

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,600
 And other youth will be here, so we will be together in the park together.

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,400
 And right now I want to invite Pastor Andrew up for a very important announcement on our

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,500
 vision and church plan.

71
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,600
 That is right.

72
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,300
 So, hey everyone.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
 Hi.

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,300
 So we're super excited.

75
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,400
 We had Vision Sunday Part 1 back at the end of March where we gave you a bit of an update

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,400
 on what we're doing with our river vision here at the Vine, how we believe that God

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,400
 is sending us out from Wanchai to be a flowing river around our city.

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,900
 And as part of that, we told you at the end of March that we're entering into our next

79
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,300
 development of the river, which is to a church planting season.

80
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:50,900
 A season of planting multiple, we hope and believe, churches around Hong Kong that are

81
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,300
 intentionally smaller and more community focused so that we can really begin to do the work

82
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,900
 of the gospel in local communities in our city.

83
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,300
 And we said that our desire, our prayer is that we would launch the first one by at least

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
 April of 2023.

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,200
 Well, in just a few weeks' time on May 15th, we'll be having Vision Sunday Part 2.

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,900
 And there we'll give you an update on what's been going on in the last number of months

87
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,700
 as we've been kind of working towards this.

88
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,500
 We're bringing an update on the location search.

89
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,600
 Our hope and prayer is that we'll be able to reveal to you on that Sunday which location

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,800
 we are planting in, or at least give you an idea of a number of those locations.

91
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
 And so we'll be sharing that with you.

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,100
 We're going to be bringing you a budget for what launching the church is going to cost

93
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,500
 over a three-year period, but also in particular, a one-year period.

94
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,100
 Because we want you to know that obviously this is something we're doing as a whole church.

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,800
 And of course, there's going to be some additional expenses to us as we look at launching out

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,100
 a new church community in our city.

97
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,800
 So we'll tell you a bit more about the cost involved.

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,700
 And then we're going to call you, as we often do at Vision Sunday, to bring a special offering,

99
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,000
 an offering that's above and beyond your normal tithes and the normal gifts that you would

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,500
 bring into the Vine if you're a member here at the Vine or if this is your regular church.

101
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,200
 Above that, we want to invite you to give specifically towards the church.

102
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,500
 And everything on that Sunday will go 100% to our church plant.

103
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 And here is my heart for that Sunday.

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,100
 My heart is that we would be able to raise one year's worth of operational costs for

105
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,300
 the church plant.

106
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,000
 And the reason why I want that is so that when we send Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan out,

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,400
 they don't need to worry for the first year about trying to operationally make ends meet.

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,700
 That they can just focus 100% in that first year about building a church, loving people,

109
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,300
 sharing the gospel, reaching out to their community.

110
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,100
 We want to free them to do the work of the church without that year having to worry about

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,500
 the kind of things of church, if that makes sense, the kind of financial part.

112
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,400
 And of course, we know that these church plants will eventually need to become self-sustaining

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,500
 financially, but we believe we can send them out with the best foot forward to really do

114
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 this thing well.

115
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 So that's my prayer.

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 That's my belief.

117
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,400
 So I want to ask you, as you prepare for May 15th, do not not come on May 15th.

118
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,800
 We want you to be here, okay?

119
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 In faith.

120
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,300
 You're going to come.

121
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,000
 Hear a little bit about the heart, the vision, the budget, and all that.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,700
 But I want you to be praying, "Holy Spirit, what is it that you want me to bring?"

123
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,420
 And everybody will bring something different.

124
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,540
 And actually, the issue is not the amount.

125
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,800
 And I want you to really hear this.

126
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,300
 And we say this often here at the Vine.

127
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,500
 I want you to bring what you feel the Holy Spirit says to you to bring.

128
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,300
 If he says none, don't bring anything.

129
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,300
 If he says a lot, bring a lot.

130
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,500
 If it's a little, it's a little.

131
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,900
 And I think if it's given, directed by the Holy Spirit, is exactly the right amount for

132
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,200
 you to give.

133
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,680
 And we honor that, and we pray for that, and we celebrate Jesus in that.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,560
 And I believe collectively with one heart, as we all give what the Holy Spirit challenges

135
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,000
 us individually to give, we'll see that one-year operational expenses taken care of.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Does that sound cool?

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 All right.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So that's May 15th.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Thanks, everybody.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,840
 Please be in prayer.

141
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,020
 With that, we connected with giving.

142
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,500
 We're going to take up our weekly tithes and offering.

143
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,580
 And as always, there are many digital ways to give, and we do encourage that.

144
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,580
 But if you are old school like me, we have envelopes.

145
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,980
 We can just put stuff in, and you can drop it off as you go out.

146
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,300
 So church, would you pray with me afterwards?

147
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,940
 We're going to watch Vine News together.

148
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,540
 And then after that, Pastor Andrew's going to come up and bring us the Word for today.

149
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,780
 So church, let us pray.

150
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,220
 Father, we are getting nervous, Lord God.

151
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,340
 What does it mean for us to plant a church?

152
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,980
 What does it mean to go through this new season that we've never gone through before?

153
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,260
 And I feel like this is how the Israelites felt when you led them through the Red Sea.

154
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,420
 You just led them through the wilderness, Lord God.

155
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:07,260
 And so Father, we bring what we have, and teach us, Lord God, to be known by our generosity

156
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,580
 as Christians for the rest of our life.

157
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,340
 When people see us, we don't have to even say a word, but Father, what our lifestyle,

158
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,260
 what our giving choices, how we live our life, how we spend our time, how we spend our resources.

159
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:28,700
 Would that point people to see you and wonder, "Who is this God that is so generous?"

160
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,260
 And so Father, would you be glorified through all your churches in this city?

161
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,540
 Would your work be fulfilled through each of us as we give our little part, but collectively,

162
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,820
 Lord God, it gives you glory.

163
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,320
 So Father, thank you for hearing us and lead us in the days ahead in discerning how we

164
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,380
 are to be involved in the bigger picture of your kingdom.

165
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,380
 In your name we pray.

166
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
 Amen.

167

 Let's check out Vy News.

168
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:05,820
 Happy Sunday Church.

169
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,700
 My name is Fang Jie, and welcome back to Vy News.

 Mentoring happens up and down the generational ladder.

177
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,700
 We need a community to grow and speak truth into us, to share wisdom and remain connected

178
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,980
 to the body of Christ.

179
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:59,580
 This is why we want to invite you to become a mentor for our youth as they blossom into

180
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,900
 finding their place and their faith.

181
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,180
 Contact Pastor Grace to become a mentor for our youth.

182
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,260
 We will be running the next Missions Catalyst starting on 11th of May.

183
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:22,380
 The Catalyst is a full week focused experience learning about the issue of anti-human trafficking,

184
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,500

201
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
 Wonderful.

202
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
 Good morning, everyone.

203
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
 How are you?

204
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
 Good morning, everyone online.

205
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
 It's great to have you with us as well.

206
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
 We hope you're doing great.

207
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,700
 I'm so excited.

208
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
 We're in week two of a very short three-week series that we are unimaginatively calling

209
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
 Reopened.

210
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
 And the idea behind this series is that as we reopen as a society in Hong Kong right

211
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,700
 now, there are some critical ways that I sense the Holy Spirit is coming to Hong Kong.

212
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

213
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

214
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

215
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

216
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

217
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

218
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

219
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:22,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

220
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:49,700
 And I think that's a great way to start.

221
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,700
 And so although the social distancing measures have come down, and although we're reopening

222
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,700
 as society, the challenge for us is how do we make sure we don't reopen with a closed

223
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
 spirit?

224
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,700
 And so we're taking this series and looking at three specific ways over these three weeks

225
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
 that I think the Holy Spirit wants to reopen you.

226
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,700
 And last week, I spoke about the important need for healing, that if we're truly going

227
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,700
 to be the people that God wants us to be in Hong Kong in this hour, we have to open ourselves

228
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
 up to a journey of healing.

229
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:28,700
 I said importantly last week that the removal of the problem is not necessarily the healing.

230
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,700
 That just because the social distancing measures have changed, just because COVID seems to

231
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,700
 be coming down, just because it seems like society is a better place, it doesn't suddenly

232
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
 mean that we're all going to experience great flourishing.

233
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 Because the reality is we have all carried trauma with us over the last two and three

234
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
 years.

235
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,700
 And that trauma doesn't just get wiped away because the problem of COVID is being removed.

236
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,700
 That trauma requires nothing less than the deep work of the cleansing, beautiful, powerful

237
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
 work of the Spirit of God on us.

238
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,700
 And so I challenged us last week, it's time to be open to a healing journey.

239
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,700
 To not put a Band-Aid on our COVID trauma, but to bring it to God.

240
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,700
 And I said last week that the place of our healing is found in forgiveness.

241
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,700
 Forgiveness with God, forgiveness with one another, forgiveness even of ourselves.

242
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:27,700
 And that as we journey in a process of forgiveness, we produce this incredible thing, the love

243
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
 of God.

244
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,700
 The love of God is found in us, and the love of God then can move through us to people

245
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
 in our city.

246
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,700
 My challenge to us last week is that our city needs a healing movement off the back of everything

247
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
 it has experienced.

248
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,700
 But the church, if it is to be a vessel of God's love, has to heal.

249
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,700
 And the way we heal is by opening ourselves up to the forgiving power of Jesus Christ.

250
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,700
 Are you with me?

251
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,700
 That was last week, but this week I want to focus again and continue to focus in on the

252
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
 personal.

253
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,700
 I want to speak again about what's going on inside of us.

254
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,700
 And I want to share something today that is not necessarily going to be easy for us to

255
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
 hear.

256
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,700
 It's going to be a challenging word, but I want to just pray and ask you up front just

257
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
 to keep your heart open to this.

258
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,700
 Because I think what I'm going to share this morning is perhaps the most critical thing

259
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:35,700
 that the Holy Spirit wants to do in your life as you now reemerge out of this fifth wave.

260
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
 And I want to say this right up front.

261
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,700
 I want to frame it by naming some things.

262
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:48,700
 I think right now in the global church, God is doing something unprecedented that he hasn't

263
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
 done for many years.

264
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,700
 In fact, if I was to put it most bluntly and cleanly, I would say it this way.

265
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:05,700
 That the Holy Spirit is shining an uncomfortably bright light on what is wrong, evil, and broken

266
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,700
 in the global church that he so deeply loves.

267
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:16,700
 He's shining a uncomfortably bright light on the sin that is in the church.

268
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,700
 I don't know about you, but I've lost count of the number of global Christian leaders

269
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
 that have had a fall from grace recently.

270
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:30,700
 And I want to just honor the incredibly brave men and women who are coming forward in the

271
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,700
 pews around the world and speaking up for some of the experiences that they have experienced.

272
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,700
 We know the church is not a perfect place, but we have seen people, leaders, churches

273
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,700
 we've respected, leaders that we've honored, people that we've followed for many years

274
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,700
 have leadership and moral failures.

275
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,700
 We've seen power and spiritual abuse taking place in the church.

276
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:02,700
 We've seen recently sexual and exploitative practices taking place within the church,

277
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,700
 and this breaks God's heart.

278
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,700
 And I think what we're experiencing in the global church, we need to name.

279
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:15,700
 What we're experiencing is, the best way I could say it is this, I think Jesus is coming

280
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,700
 once again to cleanse the temple.

281
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,700
 And like in that time where he came and he turned over tables and it was uncomfortable

282
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,700
 for people, I think there's a global move of the spirit right now that isn't comfortable

283
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,700
 for us in the church, but it's one that is founded in love.

284
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:44,700
 That God so loves his church, his bride, his people, that he would care so deeply that

285
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,700
 he would come and turn tables that need to be turned.

286
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,700
 Now this is interesting because it's very easy for us here in Hong Kong, perhaps in

287
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,700
 this time, to hear the stories, to read the newspaper articles, to see the stuff happening

288
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,700
 on social media, to almost, if you will, point fingers at all the things that are happening

289
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,700
 in the messiness of the global church out there.

290
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,700
 We're really good, I think, as Christians at seeing the speck in everybody else's eyes

291
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
 and ignoring the plank that might be in ours.

292
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:19,700
 And I think if the global church, if the spirit of God is moving upon the global church right

293
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:26,700
 now in this way, then that means he's also moving on the local church right here in Hong Kong.

294
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,700
 And I want to say this, a question before us that I want to challenge us as a church,

295
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:38,700
 a church that I deeply love here at the Vine, I want to ask us this, could it be that Jesus

296
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:49,700
 also needs to turn up right here, right now, and turn over some of our tables?

297
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,700
 This moment where Jesus came and turned over the tables in Scripture, in that moment when

298
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,700
 he entered the temple, is one of the most powerful, symbolic, and prophetic moments

299
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,700
 that Jesus does in all of his ministry.

300
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,700
 It's a moment that's captured for us actually in all four of the Gospels.

301
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
 That's how important it was.

302
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,700
 And I want to read to you today from the Gospel of Matthew, because Matthew presents it in

303
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,700
 a clear and concise way.

304
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,700
 Let me read this to us, Matthew 21, starting in verse 12.

305
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
 Everybody okay?

306
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,700
 Strap yourselves in.

307
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
 You ready?

308
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,700
 I love you.

309
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
 Just know that up front.

310
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,700
 Jesus loves you more.

311
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
 Amen.

312
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,700
 "Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there.

313
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,700
 He overturned the temples of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.

314
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,700
 'It is written,' he said to them, 'My house will become a house of prayer, but you are

315
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,700
 making it a den of robbers.'"

316
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,700
 The context here is the Passover festival, the festival that the Jewish people celebrated

317
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,700
 for one week every year, the most important festival that they celebrated, a festival

318
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:01,700
 of great cheer and joy, because it was a festival that celebrated the miraculous power of God

319
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:07,700
 to be able to step into a broken people, redeem and restore them, tell Pharaoh to let my people

320
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,700
 go, and by his miracle working power through the blood placed over every wall and door,

321
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,700
 release the Jewish people towards their promised land.

322
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,700
 And once a year, they would gather.

323
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,700
 Jewish people and God-fearing Greeks from all over the Greco-Roman Empire would gather

324
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,700
 in Jerusalem for this week to literally celebrate the power and the beauty and the wonder of

325
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,700
 a God who sets people free.

326
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,700
 And alongside of that is this really interesting historical footnote, because Jerusalem in

327
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,700
 this week is celebrating the release of slavery from oppression, but in that moment, they

328
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
 were still under oppression.

329
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,700
 The Greco-Roman Empire still ruling harshly over them.

330
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,700
 And so alongside of the celebration was this tense political atmosphere in Jerusalem at

331
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
 the time of that week.

332
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,700
 The zealots who were a sect of Judaism at the time believed in inciting violence and

333
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,700
 rebellion in order to bring a toppling of the power, and those zealots were active in

334
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
 this week.

335
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,700
 So the Passover week, yes, it was a celebration of the wonder and power of God, but it was

336
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
 also this tense moment.

337
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:22,700
 You could almost feel it in the city, a politically tense time, and I wonder if that reminds us

338
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
 of anything.

339
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,700
 And in the middle of this, Jesus comes.

340
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,700
 In fact, he decides that this is the week that he should show up in Jerusalem.

341
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,700
 And he shows up on that donkey, fulfilling Old Testament prophetic tradition, but also

342
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,700
 importantly, not coming as a conquering king as everybody wanted the Messiah to do, but

343
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,700
 coming as a humble servant.

344
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:53,700
 The first thing he does is he walks straight off that donkey, straight to the temple.

345
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
 Ah, the temple.

346
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,700
 The temple was the most magnificent, beautiful thing.

347
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,700
 It was the place that housed God's presence on earth, the glory of his presence for all

348
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,700
 to see, and Jesus had a relationship, a long relationship with the temple.

349
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,700
 We know in Scripture that Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple when he was just

350
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,700
 eight days old to be dedicated before the Lord and to be circumcised.

351
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,700
 We know that actually during his youth, he had his bar mitzvah at the temple at the age

352
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
 of 12.

353
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
 That great story, right, where he stayed behind after his family had left so that he could

354
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,700
 teach in the temple courts and his parents are freaking out because they can't find him,

355
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,700
 right?

356
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,700
 After that, though, we don't hear any more stories of Jesus visiting Jerusalem or the

357
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
 temple.

358
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,700
 In fact, for the majority of his ministry, Jesus purposely stays away from Jerusalem

359
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,700
 and the temple, and he stays away because he knows that when he does set foot in that

360
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,700
 temple, he knows that there is going to be a stirring and the beginning of all of the

361
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,700
 events that are going to precipitate themselves to his death on the cross and his resurrection.

362
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,700
 Before he was ready for that, he had teaching to do, miracles to do, compassion to lay

363
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
 out.

364
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,700
 He needed to shape what the kingdom of God was going to look like, and so he had done

365
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,700
 all that, and now at this moment, he finally shows up to the temple for the very first

366
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,700
 time in years, and what he sees tears his heart apart.

367
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:28,700
 He walks into this temple expecting it to be a certain way, and it's completely changed

368
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,700
 since the last time he went there.

369
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
 Because of that, he does some crazy stuff.

370
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
 Listen to this.

371
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,700
 He drives out all who are buying and selling there.

372
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,700
 He overturns the temple, the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling

373
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
 doves.

374
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,700
 This is not a Jesus that we know, is it?

375
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
 We don't know this kind of Jesus.

376
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,700
 This is not a Jesus that's particularly comfortable for us.

377
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,700
 In fact, we read about this sort of Jesus, and we wonder how this kind of Jesus fits

378
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,700
 into the nice, loving, kind, compassionate, merciful, powerful type Jesus, the kumbaya,

379
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,700
 I want to sit on your lap and give you a cuddle, safe kind of Jesus.

380
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,700
 That's the Jesus that largely the gospels have shown us.

381
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,700
 In fact, that's the Jesus that Matthew has shown us, pages and pages of his compassion

382
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,700
 and his love and his mercy and his grace, and we're building up this profile of who

383
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,700
 Jesus is, and then in this moment, Jesus breaks out of the box that we've all put him in.

384
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,700
 And because he's suddenly now doing stuff that we didn't expect, that we don't think

385
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,700
 fits the sort of Jesus profile we have, we really struggle to understand this Jesus.

386
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,700
 This is like that Christmas lunch that you had a few years ago where your uncle drank

387
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,700
 too much and started to say and do things that embarrassed the whole family, and now

388
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,700
 no one talks about it.

389
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,700
 Are you with me?

390
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
 We all have that uncle.

391
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,700
 This is like the disciples are like, "Who is this Jesus?"

392
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,700
 Like we don't know or necessarily recognize this, and I think this is the point.

393
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,700
 You see, Jesus is doing something in this moment that he wants his church, he wants

394
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,700
 his disciples, the apostles to truly understand actually about his character and his nature.

395
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,700
 That Jesus, yes, is the one who's compassionate and loving and kind, but the kind of Jesus

396
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:26,700
 we worship is not just a miracle-working, lost sheep gathering, kind, wise, old sage.

397
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,700
 He is also a Jesus who is so passionate about the kingdom of God that if something comes

398
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,700
 against the ongoing, unfolding work of the kingdom, if something works against the very

399
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,700
 heart and the vision that God has, if the very dwelling place of God's presence on

400
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,700
 earth is not actually representing the things that it should be representing about God,

401
00:26:50,700 --> 00:27:00,700
 then yes, Jesus will show up, and if the moment is right, he will turn over tables.

402
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:11,700
 Yes, Jesus is one who turns over the cheek, but he's also one who turns over tables.

403
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,700
 The question is, do we want to know that Jesus?

404
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,700
 Interestingly, the fact that the temple court was filled with merchants and people selling

405
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,700
 and trading was not necessarily unusual because the temple was all about the sacrificial system.

406
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,700
 It was all actually about taking an animal, bringing an animal, and sacrificing it as

407
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,700
 a worship offering to God, and so the Jewish leaders of the temple had actually created

408
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,700
 an environment by which worshipers could do what it was that they should do when they

409
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
 came to the temple.

410
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,700
 I mean, it would have been really annoying for worshipers to have to carry their own

411
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,700
 animals from their home to the temple to worship, and so instead, we made it easy for them.

412
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,700
 We just set up places where they could buy their pigeons or their doves or for the wealthy,

413
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,700
 the goats and the sheep, to be able to bring in and to sacrifice in the temple.

414
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
 It kind of makes sense.

415
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,700
 So the question is, what's Jesus really upset about here?

416
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,700
 Well, we get that answer by looking not just at what he did, but looking at what he said

417
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
 as he did it.

418
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
 Is this okay for everybody so far?

419
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
 You with me?

420
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,700
 All right, good.

421
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,700
 Listen to what he said.

422
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,700
 "It is written," he said to them, "My house will be called a house of prayer," other places,

423
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,700
 "a house of prayer for all nations, but you are making it a den of robbers."

424
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,700
 Jesus, as he classically does, quotes from two Old Testament prophets in front of all

425
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,700
 the people to explain to them why he was doing what he was doing.

426
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,700
 He quotes literally from Isaiah 56, verse 7, and Jeremiah 7, verse 11.

427
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,700
 And we need to understand these two things to understand the bigger context of what's

428
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
 happening here.

429
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
 So let me just briefly open these up for you.

430
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
 Let's start with Jeremiah.

431
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,700
 Jeremiah was not a comfortable prophet to be around.

432
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,700
 I don't know if you've ever tried to read the book of Jeremiah.

433
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,700
 It is hard going.

434
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,700
 Jeremiah spends the majority of his time getting in the face of Israel and speaking to them

435
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
 about their sin.

436
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,700
 And chapter 7, where we're looking at here and what Jesus speaks from, is the very place

437
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,700
 where Jeremiah actually confronts Israel for the sin of the temple.

438
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,700
 Let me read this to you from Jeremiah 7, starting in verse 9.

439
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,700
 This is God speaking through Jeremiah.

440
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:38,700
 "Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal, and follow

441
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,700
 other gods that you have not known?

442
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:47,700
 And then," note this, "come and stand before me in this house, which bears my name,

443
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,700
 and say, 'Oh, we are safe, safe to do all these detestable things.'

444
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:59,700
 Has this house, which bears my name, become a den of robbers to you?

445
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,700
 What I've been watching,' declares the Lord."

446
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:09,700
 This is not good.

447
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,700
 God uses Jeremiah to confront Israel.

448
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,700
 And basically he's saying, "Look, this is how you live Monday to Saturday.

449
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,700
 You are adulterers, you're fornicators, you're doing all this stuff, you're lying, you're

450
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
 worshipping other gods.

451
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,700
 And then you come on Sunday into the house of God, a house that bears my name."

452
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
 It's almost like God is saying, and this is the critical bit.

453
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,700
 Let me read that bit to you one more time, because this is super, super critical.

454
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,700
 He says, "This house, which bears my name."

455
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,700
 See, I think God wouldn't care so much if you're acting like that in your house.

456
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,700
 I think he does still care, but less so.

457
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,700
 But when you come into his house, he's saying to Israel, "You come into the temple, and

458
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,700
 you bring all of that stuff with you, the house that bears my name."

459
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,700
 This is like, he's basically saying, "This temple is supposed to represent my character."

460
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,700
 When Scripture speaks of the name, it doesn't mean God.

461
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
 It means everything God represents.

462
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,700
 He's like, "My temple is supposed to represent everything about me, my heart, my compassion,

463
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
 my love, my grace.

464
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,700
 It's supposed to represent the things that the kingdom stands for.

465
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
 That's what the temple is all about.

466
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:28,700
 And you come in there, professing my name in the house that carries my name, and your

467
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,700
 name has nothing to do with my name."

468
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,700
 And he says, "That's detestable."

469
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:41,700
 Jesus shows up in the temple in the middle of a wonderful celebration of the Passover,

470
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:50,700
 and he sees that Jeremiah's prophecy has been fulfilled, that the temple is indeed run amok,

471
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,700
 and no longer represents the name of God.

472
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,700
 And so he turns over tables.

473
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,700
 Thankfully, he doesn't just speak from Jeremiah, though.

474
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,700
 He speaks from Isaiah, and Isaiah is so much nicer.

475
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,700
 Isaiah 56 is one of the great chapters in the prophetic book of Isaiah, where God paints

476
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,700
 through Isaiah a beautiful, welcoming, wonderful picture of what the kingdom of God looks like.

477
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,700
 This is Isaiah saying, "When the Messiah comes, he's going to bring a kingdom in the world

478
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
 that looks like this."

479
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:30,700
 And there are three things in Isaiah 56 specifically that the vision of the kingdom looks like.

480
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,700
 First of all, all the broken are going to be able to come into covenant with God.

481
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,700
 God is going to open his heart, so if anybody is broken, they're going to be able to find

482
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,700
 restitution, restoration, forgiveness, and love with God.

483
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,700
 The broken are welcome.

484
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,700
 The second thing you see in Isaiah 56, in this grand vision of God's heart, is that

485
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,700
 you see foreigners are welcome to come and draw near to God.

486
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,700
 Gentiles, you and I, if you're not a Jewish person in this room or watching online, we

487
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,700
 are welcome to come in and draw near to the presence of God.

488
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,700
 It's right there in God's grand scheme of how he sees the world.

489
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:16,700
 And then thirdly, outcasts, the defiled, the sinful, the ones who are not clean, they are

490
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,700
 also welcomed to God's presence.

491
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,700
 They're welcomed in, which I want to tell you is very good news for every single one

492
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
 of us.

493
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,700
 And Isaiah 56 is basically Isaiah prophesying over a broken Israel who are coming back from

494
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,700
 exile, reestablishing themselves back in the land, and they're about to build this temple

495
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
 again.

496
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,700
 And Isaiah is saying this, if you're going to build a house that carries God's name,

497
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,700
 it's going to have to look something like this, where the broken are welcomed.

498
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,700
 It's going to have to look a bit like a place where actually foreigners can come and gather.

499
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,700
 And it needs to look like a bit of a place where the outcasts, the ones that you think

500
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,700
 shouldn't be in the temple, get to come and worship in the temple.

501
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
 That's the great vision.

502
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:08,700
 And Jesus shows up in the temple at Passover, and the very place, note this, the very place

503
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:16,700
 that was designed by Zerubbabel, who built the temple, to house Isaiah's 56 chapter vision,

504
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,700
 it was called the court of the Gentiles, the place where the Gentiles could come, the place

505
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,700
 where the outcasts were welcomed, the place where those who are broken could find covenant

506
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:33,700
 with God, that outer court was so filled with Jewish people trying to profit off the sacrificial

507
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:39,700
 system that there was no longer any room for the Gentiles to come.

508
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:47,700
 The Gentile court had become a merchant place of exploitative practices, and Jesus shows

509
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,700
 up, and he is broken by this.

510
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,700
 It's not only about what Jeremiah saw and the sin that they were carrying, it was also

511
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:00,700
 about the fact that the temple was no longer revealing the kingdom of God.

512
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
 It was no longer showing the world what the kingdom needed to look like.

513
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:10,700
 You see, the Jewish leaders had turned over their temple, so Jesus showed up and turned

514
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,700
 over their tables.

515
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,700
 You need to know this about God.

516
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:23,700
 You need to know this, that Jesus will always fight for the places on earth where his presence

517
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:33,700
 dwells, that Jesus is jealous over his house, that Jesus is purifying his bride, that a

518
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,700
 broken church like we are will be presented to him one day when he returns as a pure,

519
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,700
 spotless bride, that Jesus loves to fight on behalf of the places where his presence

520
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,700
 dwells.

521
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,700
 And this idea becomes the cornerstone of how the first church thought about discipleship.

522
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:56,700
 This idea becomes the cornerstone of how the first church begins to teach what it is to

523
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:01,700
 know and encounter and be with the presence of God, because no longer is this church drawing

524
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
 itself to that physical temple.

525
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,700
 That church is now gathering in smaller communities all around the Greco-Roman Empire, and the

526
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,700
 church was wondering, "How do we continue to understand and walk with and encounter

527
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,700
 the presence of God?"

528
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:24,700
 And then Paul, the Apostle Paul, writing just a few years after Jesus had cleansed the temple

529
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:32,700
 by turning over tables, the Apostle Paul writes to his church, who are trying to work out

530
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,700
 all of what discipleship now looked like under the death and resurrection of Jesus.

531
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:44,700
 He writes something to them that was so revolutionary and so controversial that even still to this

532
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,700
 day it blows my mind.

533
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
 Are you ready for this?

534
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,700
 Are you still here?

535
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
 Are you okay?

536
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,700
 I've been nice so far, by the way.

537
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,700
 Are you ready?

538
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,700
 Flee from sexual immorality.

539
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,700
 For all other sins a person commits are outside their body.

540
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,700
 But he who sins sexually sins against his own body.

541
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
 Here it is.

542
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:22,700
 Do you not know that the body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you?

543
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,700
 You are not your own.

544
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,700
 You were brought at a price.

545
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,700
 Therefore, honor God with your body.

546
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:38,700
 It blows my mind that Paul is able to do something that is so powerfully theological as this.

547
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,700
 What Paul does is basically go this.

548
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,700
 Do you know all of that stuff that we believed about the temple in Jerusalem?

549
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,700
 How it was supposed to be a place that carries the name of God?

550
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,700
 How it was literally the dwelling place on earth where the presence of God was?

551
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,700
 How Isaiah 56 vision said that it was a place where the broken could come, where the Gentiles

552
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
 were welcome, where the outcasts were.

553
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
 Do you remember all of that about the temple?

554
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,700
 Great.

555
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
 Well, hold that in your mind.

556
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,700
 You now are the temple.

557
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,700
 You, yourself, you, your body.

558
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
 You have the Holy Spirit now dwelling in you.

559
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,700
 Before Jesus' death and resurrection, that Holy Spirit dwelt in the temple and we had

560
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
 to gather towards that temple.

561
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,700
 Now, because of what happens in Acts chapter 2 and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon

562
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,700
 the church, Paul is saying to his church, "That Spirit now lives in you."

563
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,700
 If the Spirit of God dwells in you, you, yourself, are a temple.

564
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,700
 Your body, he says, is a temple of the Holy Spirit.

565
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,700
 By that, he's talking about the physical body, but he's also talking about your lifestyle,

566
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,700
 who you are, how you operate, what you think, the way you go about in the world.

567
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,700
 All of that is a representation of the vision of Isaiah 56.

568
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,700
 The beauty of the kingdom of God is now found in you because the Spirit has decided to reside

569
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,700
 in you and it's such a beautiful vision.

570
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,700
 And when you understand, oh man, I'm getting excited.

571
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:07,700
 When you understand that the Greco-Roman concept of the body was basically one where it was

572
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,700
 immaterial, it was a shell.

573
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
 The body wasn't important.

574
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:16,700
 What mattered was the immortal soul and the immortal soul was inside this shell of a body,

575
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:22,700
 but eventually that body will pass, but the immortal soul will somehow go up and be with the gods.

576
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,700
 And so the Greco-Roman culture and the Greco-Roman philosophical thought was it doesn't really

577
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
 matter what you do with your body.

578
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,700
 In fact, Paul quotes from the philosophers at the beginning of this chapter,

579
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,700
 "Everything is permissible for me," he says, "but not everything is beneficial."

580
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,700
 "I can eat and drink and do what I want with my body, but are you really free?"

581
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,700
 he challenges his church.

582
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,700
 He's speaking against the Greco-Roman thought that the body didn't matter.

583
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,700
 And because the body didn't matter in Greco-Roman culture, people slept around all the time.

584
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,700
 They did stuff with their bodies because it didn't really matter.

585
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:55,700
 And Paul's saying to the church, "If you bring that Greco-Roman cultural thought into the house

586
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:01,700
 that carries the name of God, you are living out Jeremiah 7 in that moment."

587
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:08,700
 No, you now need to see your body not as an immaterial shell that houses the immortality of the soul.

588
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,700
 You need to now see your body as the dwelling place on earth of the Spirit of God.

589
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,700
 And if you see it that way, it's a temple.

590
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,700
 And if it's a temple, it should carry the name of God.

591
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,700
 If it's a temple, it should stand for the vision of the kingdom of God.

592
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:29,700
 What you do with your life, your words, your mouth, your body, it matters, Paul is saying to the church.

593
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,700
 And because it matters, you're a temple of the living Holy Spirit.

594
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:40,700
 And if we're a temple of God, then here's the question we ask ourselves.

595
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,700
 Are we a temple that pleases Jesus?

596
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,700
 Or let me ask it in another way that I think is quite sobering.

597
00:40:49,700 --> 00:41:01,700
 If Jesus was to show up today in your temple, would He need to turn over any tables?

598
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,700
 I want you to think about that for a moment.

599
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:12,700
 I know if Jesus was to show up in my temple, and He is and has and is right now, because I can sense Him,

600
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,700
 I know there are tables that need to be turned over in mine.

601
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:27,700
 As we emerge out of this fifth wave, and as we desire to be the people of God that God truly needs for Hong Kong in this time,

602
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,700
 a Hong Kong that desperately needs healing and strengthening,

603
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,700
 then I think we have to allow the Holy Spirit to do what's happening globally, locally.

604
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:47,700
 I think we have to open up our temple, both the collective corporate temple, but also the individual personal temple,

605
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:54,700
 and allow the Holy Spirit to come in and drive out some thoughts and some ideas,

606
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,700
 and some of the ways that we think about others, some of the stuff that we hold in our minds.

607
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:05,700
 And we need to allow Jesus to come in and turn over the tables of our practices,

608
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,700
 some of the things that we do that don't bring glory to the name of God.

609
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,700
 And no one is perfect.

610
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:19,700
 And this isn't about being perfect, but this is about being purified and cleansed.

611
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:26,700
 You see, Jesus' presence is always at work purifying His church.

612
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:36,700
 And He will come and He will do that both in the gentleness of grace and in the righteousness of anger.

613
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,700
 And I want you to hear this, because this is the most important thing I'm going to say.

614
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,700
 Both of those are acts of love.

615
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,700
 Both of those is Jesus showing His love.

616
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:54,700
 Scriptures teach us that the greatest place of love that has ever been seen is the cross of Jesus Christ.

617
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,700
 It is that painful execution where He paid the price for our sins.

618
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:04,700
 That is the greatest act of love that this world has ever seen or ever known.

619
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,700
 You see, love and sin are far more connected than perhaps we realize.

620
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:19,700
 And when Jesus comes to cleanse His temple, it's actually an act of love for the temple and for the people within it.

621
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,700
 And so when we actually take a good hard look at the sin in our lives,

622
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:31,700
 what we're actually doing is opening ourselves up to the deepest encounter of the love of Christ that we can.

623
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,700
 I wonder if you've ever thought of it that way before.

624
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,700
 I love one of my heroes of the faith is Pope Francis.

625
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,700
 I love how Pope Francis puts this. Let me read this to you.

626
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,700
 He says this, "The privileged place for the encounter with Christ is our sins."

627
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,700
 Isn't that amazing?

628
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:56,700
 Not as Paul would write, "So therefore do I just go on sinning so that I can receive more of His grace?" No.

629
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,700
 But isn't it amazing that the privileged place for us as Christians,

630
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:06,700
 for the encounter of the love of Christ, is the recognition of our sin?

631
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:13,700
 Because as we see our sin and as we know it and understand it, we bring it to Him and He frees us from it.

632
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:18,700
 So what does it mean for us to reopen the end of this fifth wave?

633
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:24,700
 I think it means this, that we take a good honest look at what is happening in our temple

634
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:29,700
 and we invite Jesus to come and turn over any tables.

635
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,700
 And so because of that, I stand before you today without making an apology to say,

636
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,700
 "Deal with the sin in your life."

637
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,700
 Because we're in a season by the Holy Spirit over the global church that I believe is a season of grace.

638
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,700
 There's a window of grace.

639
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:54,700
 And when we deal with our sin, we encounter His love.

640
00:44:54,700 --> 00:45:00,700
 I don't know about you, but I want us to be a church that reveals Isaiah 56.

641
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:05,700
 A church that is so open with its arms over a broken and hurting city.

642
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:15,700
 And I know in order for us to do that, we need to open our arms to a Jesus who turns cheeks and turns tables.

643
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:22,700
 A Jesus who so loves us that He's willing to come and cleanse and purify us.

644
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,700
 It is a good, good thing.

645
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:33,700
 And I pray that you would open yourselves up today to encourage that and invite that kind of love.

646
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:38,700
 I wonder whether we could pray together. Could we pray?

647
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,700
 Father, we are so grateful.

648
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,700
 Grateful for Your Word. Not always easy.

649
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:55,700
 Not always comfortable. But always what we need to hear.

650
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:03,700
 Lord, we thank You that Jesus gives us this part of His personality that we have to understand.

651
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:09,700
 Jesus enters the temple and is so distraught for what it's become,

652
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:17,700
 that in righteousness, in love, He grabs a hold of those two Old Testament prophetic moments.

653
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:24,700
 And He does something prophetically before the church, the people.

654
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:32,700
 Lord, I'm so thankful for Paul, who so deeply understood the temple and the work of Jesus.

655
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:39,700
 That he was able to stand before his church and challenge them, flee from sexual immorality.

656
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,700
 And that he would help them to understand that under the reign of the kingdom of God and Jesus,

657
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:50,700
 that the Greco-Roman cultural ambivalence to the body would go.

658
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:58,700
 And that a new temple had come. Us, the people of God, with the Holy Spirit inside of us,

659
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,700
 as His temple here today.

660
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,700
 Father, I want to pray for those online and for those in the room right now.

661
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:16,700
 Lord, we're grateful. We're grateful that You so love us, that You don't leave us wallowing in our sin.

662
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,700
 You so love us that You draw near to us in this moment.

663
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,700
 Lord, our hearts are heavy for the sin that we're seeing in the church around the world.

664
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:34,700
 And some of the things that have happened to men and women, it tears us apart.

665
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:40,700
 But Lord, protect us from the arrogance that would say that that is somebody else's problem.

666
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:47,700
 I pray You would give the vine the humility to look at the plank in our eye.

667
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:54,700
 Father, I want to pray that You would convict our senior leadership, Lord.

668
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:05,700
 If there are practices, attitudes, thoughts that are not of You, that don't represent Your name.

669
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,700
 Lord, would You purify Your church.

670
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:15,700
 Lord, I want to pray for the individuals in this room.

671
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,700
 I want to pray You would come now in Your love.

672
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:28,700
 No one here is perfect. Jesus is not demanding perfection.

673
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,700
 What He's doing is just drawing close to You in love and saying, "This thing right here,

674
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:39,700
 hey, let me come. I've already forgiven you of it.

675
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,700
 Let me come now and just remove it from you.

676
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,700
 Why don't you bring it to me? Why don't you give it to me?

677
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:52,700
 Why don't you let me come and just turn that table over? It's done.

678
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,700
 Why don't you let me come and just release you from that?"

679
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,700
 So I want to encourage you just in your time now, just take a moment.

680
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,700
 Allow the Holy Spirit to search your heart.

681
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,700
 I want to encourage you if you've come here together today with someone,

682
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,700
 if you're sitting amongst friends, that in this response time in a moment,

683
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,700
 I want to encourage you to actually ask somebody to pray for you.

684
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,700
 This is an important part of what confession, repentance is about.

685
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,700
 The worship team, before we started our service, we all gathered in the back stairs

686
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,700
 and we all shared confession with one another.

687
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,700
 It was such a powerful time.

688
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,700
 So if you've come here together today with some friends or people that you know

689
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,700
 and you're comfortable, I want to encourage you just to say,

690
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,700
 "Hey, the Holy Spirit's just asking me to pray for this.

691
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,700
 Would you pray for me right now?"

692
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,700
 I want to challenge you to do that.

693
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,700
 If you're here on your own today, if you're just here on your own,

694
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,700
 you can just have that time with the Holy Spirit or you can, if you're brave enough,

695
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,700
 say hi to the person next to you.

696
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,700
 We have a prayer team after the service that will stand and pray with you as well

697
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,700
 if you're here on your own today.

698
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,700
 No one needs to leave here today without prayer,

699
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,700
 whether that's prayer that's happening from people around them

700
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,700
 or whether that's prayer from us as a team.

701
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,700
 But let's not rush away from what the Spirit is saying to the church.

702
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:16,700
 If we truly want to reopen, then may we allow Jesus to cleanse us.

703
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,700
