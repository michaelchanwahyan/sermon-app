1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 We thank you for this, Jesus.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,960
 We pray this in your sweet, beautiful, majestic,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,240
 powerful, glorious name.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,680
 And the church says, amen.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,520
 Thank you, church.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,600
 Thank you, worship team.

7
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,720
 (audience applauding)

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,060
 Man, that is a beautiful song.

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,920
 I love that song so much.

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,360
 Man.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,720
 Well, good morning.

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,120
 If you're joining us online, good morning as well.

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,480
 It's good to see everybody back.

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,400
 We've enjoyed another week of black rainstorms

15
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
 and crazy weather.

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,280
 And what's going on?

17
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,480
 Seriously, it's craziness in the weather,

18
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,600
 but I'm glad everybody is here this morning.

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,160
 See some old familiar faces, which is good as well, right?

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,120
 And so, yeah, really good to see friends

21
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,300
 and family gathered together this Sunday.

22
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,680
 And if you've been walking with us through this summer,

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,880
 we've come to the end of our sermon series

24
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,720
 in the book of James.

25
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,920
 And the hope and the prayer is that we've been changed

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,700
 and moved and challenged to consider our faith seriously.

27
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,980
 Right, that we've not just been walking through a letter,

28
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,860
 but we've been letting the words through Scripture

29
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,800
 penetrate our hearts.

30
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,200
 It's a reminder that this life that we claim to live,

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
 that faith that we came to have,

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,140
 there is no room in Scripture for nominal Christianity.

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,160
 There's no room for saying, I am a Christian

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,040
 and coming here on Sunday and worshiping

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
 with our hands up, all that kind of stuff,

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,540
 without actually living it out.

37
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,280
 Because if we do that, it's just noise.

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
 It's just a distraction.

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,800
 It's almost craziness, right?

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,820
 There's a lot better places you could spend on a Sunday

41
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,960
 than coming here to this church, if you're not about that.

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,520
 But James lets us know, right, that real and pure religion,

43
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,300
 that following Christ must make a difference

44
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,400
 in the way we live our lives.

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,460
 It has to transform everything that we do.

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,940
 It's a transformative kind of faith

47
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,760
 that Jesus calls us to have.

48
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,500
 It's an active kind of faith, right,

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,000
 that moves us into deeds and actions and not just words.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,880
 It's a countercultural kind of faith

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,600
 where we're not friends with the world,

52
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,960
 but we are standing in our friendship with the Lord.

53
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,520
 Otherwise, like I said, all this is just noise.

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
 Actually, I got some really cool feedback lately.

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,880
 One of our teenagers, as he's been walking

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,840
 through the book of James, he's been listening,

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,520
 he's been reading the book of James,

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,160
 I hope by himself as well, he noticed.

59
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,760
 So in response to what he felt like God's

60
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,980
 speaking to his heart, he said he was walking

61
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,900
 down the road one day and he saw someone in need

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,180
 and so he stopped to give some money

63
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,580
 to this person that was in need.

64
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,060
 And as a result, the person behind him

65
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,380
 saw what he was doing and they too stopped

66
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,580
 and gave a little bit of money.

67
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,980
 And the person in front of him turned around

68
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,420
 and saw what he was doing and also gave

69
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,780
 that person a little bit of money.

70
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,020
 Right, just a small act of kindness, right,

71
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,380
 set off a chain reaction in the people around him.

72
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,460
 You see what difference it makes when we actually

73
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,700
 put some actions behind this faith that we claim to have.

74
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,300
 It's amazing, it's beautiful.

75
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,540
 But there's one more reason why I felt

76
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,180
 or we felt like it was important for us

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,440
 to go through this book of James and embrace its challenges.

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,580
 And that is because there is an urgency to our faith.

79
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,680
 You see, if you read through the entire letter of James

80
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,240
 in one sitting, which I highly recommend you do,

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,480
 right, you'll notice that throughout the letter

82
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,300
 there is a pressing, there's a desperation

83
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,240
 to remind everyone that time is short.

84
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,140
 Right, that Jesus is returning soon just as he promised.

85
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,320
 Right, which is why James is strong in his tone, right.

86
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,100
 We've held no punches back throughout this series.

87
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,540
 He is strong in his tone, it's challenging,

88
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,040
 but yet there's a deep and tender pastoral heart

89
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,400
 for the hearers of this letter.

90
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,400
 And the urgency and the reminder that we cannot wait

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
 to act upon this.

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,460
 Our faith in Jesus must start making an impact right now.

93
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,460
 So once again, read with me as we come to the closing words

94
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,680
 of this letter, yes, it's gonna continue to be challenging,

95
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,720
 but at the same time, I hope you know that it's filled

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,960
 by love and the passion and the recognition

97
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,520
 that there is no time to waste,

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,800
 that our time for our faith to make an impact

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,180
 is indeed right now.

100
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,040
 James chapter five, chapter first one.

101
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,640
 Now, now listen, now listen, you rich people,

102
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,000
 weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,600
 Your wealth has rotted, moths have eaten your clothes,

104
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,320
 your gold and silver are corroded.

105
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,400
 The corrosion will testify against you

106
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,480
 and eat your flesh like fire.

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,720
 You have hoarded wealth in the last days.

108
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
 Look, the wages you failed to pay the workers

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
 who mowed your fields are crying out against you.

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,660
 The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears

111
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,120
 of the Lord Almighty.

112
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,080
 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,920
 You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.

114
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,560
 You have condemned and murdered the innocent one

115
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,180
 who was not opposing you.

116
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,560
 Told you it was not easy.

117
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,720
 Have you guys ever heard the saying,

118
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,280
 it's a bit funny but I've heard it around,

119
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,000
 money doesn't solve all your problems

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,440
 but I sure wouldn't mind crying in a laberghini, right?

121
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,840
 So, I've never been, if you have a laberghini out there,

122
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
 okay, good for you, it'll be fun

123
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
 to ride around in one sometime.

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,360
 But there is a sense of irony in that saying, right?

125
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
 Because we don't usually associate rich people

126
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,920
 with things like weeping and wailing and misery, right?

127
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,240
 Because we feel like they have resources,

128
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,840
 they have everything they need, so why are you sad?

129
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
 But when we look throughout scripture,

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
 throughout the Bible, there is a consistent warning,

131
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
 maybe one of the most consistent warnings,

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,580
 which goes something along the lines of,

133
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,040
 be careful of how much you focus on money.

134
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,080
 Because God knows it's so easy for our heart

135
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,520
 and our desires to be drawn to money.

136
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,800
 And how quickly the love of money has to rob our ability

137
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,480
 of having affections for the Lord and the people around us.

138
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,120
 And once our distraction to money becomes,

139
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,840
 once money becomes an idol, the risk there

140
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,520
 is that we start to do all kinds of unjust

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,020
 and blasphemous acts to the Lord and to each other.

142
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,800
 This is what we talked about in James chapter two.

143
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,200
 When those who have, those who have the resources

144
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,880
 refuse to pay any kind of attention to those who are in need

145
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,960
 instead of just a good, pat you on the back,

146
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,800
 okay, see you later, you go off on your way,

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,300
 but I have the resources, I'm not gonna help you.

148
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,560
 The love of money is truly the root

149
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,760
 of all kinds of evil, scripture tells us.

150
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,520
 So why then are the rich suddenly weeping and wailing?

151
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,320
 Right, it's because they're suddenly seeing

152
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,080
 their riches disappear before their very eyes.

153
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,760
 Your wealth has rotted, James says.

154
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,600
 Moths have eaten your clothes.

155
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,880
 Gold and silver are being corroded.

156
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,560
 The corrosion will testify you

157
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,280
 and eat your flesh like fire.

158
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,720
 You have hoarded wealth in the last days.

159
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,620
 You see, the foolish thing about dedicating ourselves

160
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,620
 to material wealth is because material wealth will not last.

161
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,140
 In the context of James, wealth was often tied

162
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,500
 to the abundance of produce from farming, right?

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
 But what happens when you hoard food?

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
 We've done this before, right?

165
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,760
 You go to the supermarket, ooh, avocados are on sale, right?

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,120
 You get like 15 of them and they just sit

167
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,320
 below your microwave and just wilt and die

168
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
 before you have a chance to eat them, right?

169
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,140
 When you hoard food, it starts to stink and rot

170
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,560
 and it becomes useless.

171
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
 The clothes too, right?

172
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,760
 We know when Hong Kong winter is coming,

173
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
 November 5th seems to be the magic date

174
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,440
 when everybody busts out those winter coats, right?

175
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,840
 An entire bus and empty out all the streets,

176
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,520
 suddenly starts smelling like mothballs, okay?

177
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
 Because they've been in storage, okay?

178
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,480
 So mothball becomes the scent of the month, okay?

179
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,920
 But even your clothes, right?

180
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,720
 No matter how fine they are, no matter what brand they are,

181
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,240
 one day your clothes are gonna become worthless.

182
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,560
 The moth will eat them, those little silver bugs

183
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,000
 that we get in Hong Kong will chew through them.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,880
 They will become worthless.

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,120
 James is saying even gold and silver,

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,960
 two metals that are associated with being incorrodible,

187
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,120
 always holding their value, right?

188
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,000
 Even one day, gold and silver are gonna become worthless.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,680
 They will corrode and disappear.

190
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,880
 And as we look towards the last days,

191
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
 we have to keep this in mind.

192
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,200
 And make no mistake, church,

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,320
 this is, these are the last days that we're living in.

194
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,360
 Ever since Jesus died and resurrected

195
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,680
 and ascended to heaven, He assured us,

196
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,880
 His promise to us that one day I am going to return.

197
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
 And when He returns, yes, it's coming back to love

198
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,040
 and to restore and to redeem,

199
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,160
 to defeat the enemy once and for all, amen?

200
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,360
 To make all things new,

201
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,520
 to judge, to put an end to all injustice.

202
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,760
 He's coming, scripture tells us,

203
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,480
 to judge the living and the dead

204
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,320
 and to gather those who are faithful to Him

205
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,160
 and welcome them into His kingdom.

206
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,360
 Now, when we talk about this topic, though,

207
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
 it sounds like one of those things

208
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,120
 that's always threatened, but it's never going to happen.

209
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,160
 Right, you know like, if you go to the big department stores

210
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,200
 like Wing On, right, there's always,

211
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,120
 they're always doing a final promotional sale, right?

212
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,440
 So you go and buy something, it's like,

213
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,480
 [speaking in foreign language]

214
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
 Right, and stuff, you know?

215
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,960
 And then next week you go,

216
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,040
 and then it's suddenly like a super big final sale, okay?

217
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
 So you think, okay, this is my last chance, okay?

218
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,680
 And then you go a few weeks later,

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,720
 it's the last super big, super promotional sale, right?

220
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,960
 And so, it just keeps going on and on and on.

221
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,800
 It's just a marketing tactic, right?

222
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,320
 It never actually ends, right?

223
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,960
 And you realize it's just a big scam.

224
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,560
 They just want you to buy stuff.

225
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,520
 But church, this is not the case.

226
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,800
 This is not what we're talking about here, right?

227
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,680
 The return of Jesus is not a scam, right?

228
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,080
 It's not some made up story aimed to keep us on our toes.

229
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,320
 Jesus said it Himself, "Keep watch.

230
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,960
 "You do not know on what day or hour even

231
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,560
 "the Lord will come."

232
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,640
 And just as Pastor Carlos said last week,

233
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,320
 God's economy is not our economy.

234
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,080
 God's timing is not our timing.

235
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,440
 And so, therefore, we are called to live

236
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,160
 as if Jesus will really return at any moment.

237
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,760
 And in these last days before Jesus comes back,

238
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,280
 in the time where Jesus has already begun the work

239
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,760
 of inaugurating His kingdom here on earth,

240
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,680
 to making things new, to redeeming His creation,

241
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,760
 hoarding wealth is the exact opposite

242
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,760
 of what He has called us to do with our resources.

243
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,160
 When Jesus came back, didn't He flip

244
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,080
 this entire approach on its head?

245
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,000
 Instead, didn't He say, "Blessed are the poor,

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,360
 "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

247
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,480
 Didn't Jesus teach us, as hard as it is for us to hear,

248
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle

249
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,440
 than it is for someone who is rich

250
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,200
 to enter the kingdom of God?

251
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,480
 Wasn't Jesus' words to the rich young ruler,

252
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,360
 "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions,

253
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,400
 "give it to the poor, you will have treasure in heaven,

254
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,200
 "and then come follow me."

255
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,520
 So hoarding wealth doesn't make sense,

256
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,280
 but there's something even worse going on here.

257
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,160
 It's not just that the rich have hoarded all this wealth.

258
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,280
 The bigger problem is they have done it

259
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,080
 on the backs, on the expense of other people.

260
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,600
 First Paul says this, "Look, the wages you have failed

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,500
 "to pay the workers who mowed your fields

262
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,620
 "are crying out against you.

263
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,320
 "The cries of harvesters have reached

264
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,460
 "the ears of the Lord Almighty.

265
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,320
 "You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.

266
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,740
 "You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.

267
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,000
 "You have condemned and murdered the innocent one

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,300
 "who was not opposing you."

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,320
 All this wealth that these people have

270
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,320
 has been created through dishonest and unjust practices.

271
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
 Right, and the law, the Levitical law

272
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,400
 had rules addressing this kind of behavior.

273
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,580
 Deuteronomy 24 says this, "Pay them their wages,

274
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,620
 "pay the workers their wages, each day before sunset,

275
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,520
 "because they are poor and they're counting on it.

276
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,740
 "Otherwise, they may cry to the Lord against you,

277
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,200
 "and you will be guilty of sin."

278
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,940
 So James is concerned about the attitude

279
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,720
 and the fact that the rich are not using their resources

280
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,880
 to help others just as the Lord has instructed us to do.

281
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,160
 But rather, they would live selfishly,

282
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,680
 in luxury, in self-indulgence.

283
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,400
 And James is condemning the fact that we are hoarding wealth

284
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,240
 where we should use it to help those who are in need.

285
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,780
 And like I said just now, this is one of the dangers.

286
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,480
 When we make money and resources and idol,

287
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,440
 the danger is we dehumanize image bearers of God,

288
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,200
 of God's people and His children.

289
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,600
 And while we're enjoying luxury and self-indulgence,

290
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,920
 people aren't even being given what they are due.

291
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,940
 And our eyes and ears become so dull

292
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,100
 that we're blinded and muted for seeing and hearing

293
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,900
 those who are crying out.

294
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,160
 But God sees it all.

295
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,920
 Now we enjoy this thinking, we're set,

296
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,980
 things are good for me, I don't have a worry in the world.

297
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,800
 And when we live like this, James says,

298
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,280
 it's like we're fattening ourselves just to be slaughtered.

299
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,160
 It's almost like a comical picture.

300
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,280
 We are sacrificing ourselves to this worldly God

301
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,400
 of luxury and comfort.

302
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,800
 We're like the fattened calf, we're like Wagyu beef.

303
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,120
 You know how Wagyu beef, they feed the cows,

304
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,400
 all kinds of stuff, fatten it up.

305
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,320
 The end result of that cow,

306
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,960
 while he's enjoying all that stuff,

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,020
 right, oh, this is great, you know, I'm being massaged,

308
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,760
 I'm being fed all this good food.

309
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,020
 In the end, what's the end of that cow?

310
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,360
 To be slaughtered, right?

311
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,380
 And this is exactly what we're doing, James says,

312
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,240
 when we just indulge in ourselves

313
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,020
 and ignore the cries of those around us.

314
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,440
 The fate that awaits is slaughter.

315
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,240
 It's death.

316
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,340
 Church, if we make our goal in life,

317
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,640
 if what we want to do with our time in this world

318
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,000
 is just enjoy as many luxuries as possible,

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,380
 whilst at the same time ignoring the cries

320
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,760
 of those who are in need,

321
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,300
 Scripture likens it to murdering innocent people.

322
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:15,000
 And we are condemning ourselves.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,120
 And we sit around thinking, you know, there's time for that.

324
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
 I'm gonna get to that one day, right?

325
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,660
 Right now, you know, I'm here for a good time,

326
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,200
 not for a long time, so I'm just gonna focus on me

327
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,960
 and do everything what I want to do

328
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,220
 when Jesus could literally return at any moment.

329
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:37,920
 Brothers and sisters, part of our pure faith

330
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,900
 means that we cannot live like this.

331
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,260
 We cannot live like we don't want that day to come

332
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,520
 because we've made life so comfortable for ourselves.

333
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,960
 And in living like the Scripture says,

334
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,680
 we are greedy, we are undressed, we are ungodly,

335
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,600
 and it will catch up with us.

336
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,300
 We are condemning ourselves.

337
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,760
 We're preparing our flesh to be eaten like fire.

338
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,360
 But instead, as followers of Jesus,

339
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,280
 we should be hastening the day.

340
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,920
 We should be crying out to the Lord

341
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,720
 to return to make things right.

342
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,920
 We should be crying out for His justice,

343
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,020
 praying for the restoration of creation,

344
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,160
 joining in in God's work in restoring and repairing

345
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,280
 and redeeming humans to Himself.

346
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:27,760
 We look forward to the day when sin is no more,

347
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,160
 which means we are tirelessly trying to ensure

348
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,160
 that we are preparing the way for Jesus' arrival.

349
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,560
 We are preaching the Gospel.

350
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,440
 We are reaching out to those in need.

351
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,720
 We are speaking out to those who are facing injustice.

352
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,640
 This is the mission we have at hand.

353
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,720
 And we cannot sit idly by,

354
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,460
 especially when there are people out there

355
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,120
 being oppressed and suffering from injustice.

356
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,660
 God's economy is not our economy.

357
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,520
 Jesus came to turn the entire system upside down.

358
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,560
 Karl Barth says it this way.

359
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,080
 Instead of striving for higher position,

360
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,280
 more power and more influence,

361
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,120
 Jesus moves from the heights to the depths,

362
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,760
 from victory to defeat, from riches to poverty,

363
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,240
 from triumphs to suffering, from life to death.

364
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,280
 Jesus came to say, "Blessed are the poor."

365
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,560
 And His ears are always tuned to hear the voices

366
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,780
 of those crying out for justice.

367
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,280
 So we're reminded today, church,

368
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,620
 that we're here on God's time.

369
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,760
 Just because it hasn't happened yet,

370
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,440
 don't think that it's not going to.

371
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,600
 And Jesus is returning.

372
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
 James reminds us of that.

373
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,840
 And so to end this letter,

374
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
 he gives us some instructions on how he wants us to live.

375
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,960
 Taking care of the poor, the widow and the orphans,

376
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,380
 doing God's work of justice.

377
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,300
 But there's two more things he wants us to embrace

378
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,180
 as we look into these last days.

379
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,140
 The two things are this, patience and prayer.

380
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,720
 Patience and prayer.

381
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
 Let's look at patience for a minute.

382
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,780
 Firstly, James calls us to be patient in the Lord.

383
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,420
 Now again, in our modern day lives,

384
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,800
 it's almost like the entire idea of patience

385
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,160
 is trying to be erased from our vocabulary.

386
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,420
 We don't like waiting for stuff.

387
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,580
 Everything is marketed towards the idea

388
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,280
 that the faster, the more convenient it is,

389
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
 the better for us, right?

390
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,480
 [speaking in foreign language]

391
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,640
 Right, that's a Hong Kong motto.

392
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,120
 Everything is on demand.

393
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,560
 You can order anything you want at any time

394
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,540
 with the touch of a button.

395
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,840
 You can have food, clothes, anything you want delivered

396
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,200
 right to your doorstep almost immediately.

397
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,240
 Now, I'll be a hypocrite to say

398
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,720
 I don't enjoy the conveniences of modern life.

399
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,820
 It's great sometimes to have those things available to us.

400
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,880
 But again, the danger is that this way of living

401
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,400
 robs us and dulls us of how God wants us to respond

402
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,640
 to how he wants us to live.

403
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,340
 And we forget the value in waiting

404
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,360
 and having patience in the Lord.

405
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,800
 Waiting on the Lord will always lead

406
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,940
 to something of great value.

407
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,340
 Every time we wait on the Lord, it's not time wasted.

408
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,620
 It's not doing nothing, but it's trusting

409
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
 that God is doing something

410
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,780
 and that one day it's going to bear fruit, right?

411
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,420
 This is why patience is part of the fruit of the Spirit

412
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,680
 that scripture encourages us to grow in.

413
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,720
 That's why patience is a key component of love.

414
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,380
 And when we are patiently waiting on our Lord,

415
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,060
 it's a sign of the hope and the faith that we have in Jesus.

416
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,260
 James uses a illustration from agriculture

417
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,740
 to highlight this to us.

418
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,580
 He says this, "See how the farmer waits for the land

419
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,700
 "to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting

420
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,880
 "for the autumn and spring rains.

421
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,720
 "You too, be patient and stand firm

422
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,520
 "because the Lord's coming is near."

423
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,940
 Again, we go to our wet markets, we go to Welcome,

424
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,780
 we go to Park and Shop, wherever we like to do our shopping,

425
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,100
 right, and we see the rows and rows of fruits

426
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,820
 and vegetables, the meat, everything is right there

427
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,460
 ready for us just to take to the counter,

428
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,140
 check out, and take home.

429
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,340
 But next time we go, be mindful.

430
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,180
 The way that produce got there wasn't just magic, right?

431
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,580
 It wasn't just someone just made them appear.

432
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,140
 It's gone through the time of growing, of tilling,

433
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,980
 there was a farmer or a process, right,

434
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,940
 that all that stuff had to go through

435
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,060
 in order for it to end up on our supermarket shelves.

436
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,880
 And there was a person who planted seed and waited,

437
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,500
 and it seemed like nothing was happening

438
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,280
 until that plant begins to break through the soil.

439
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,420
 And this is the same for us.

440
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,380
 Whilst we're waiting, while God is calling us

441
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,120
 to be patient, we're like a farmer.

442
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,540
 We're hard at work, planting seeds, tilling the ground,

443
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,100
 knowing that God is the one who's gonna do the growing,

444
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,900
 and that in due time, we will reap a harvest

445
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,180
 to collect in God's name.

446
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,540
 So we are patient in the Lord.

447
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,020
 But James also tells us this.

448
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,160
 As we do that, we need to be patient with each other.

449
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,180
 Don't grumble against one another, he says,

450
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,340
 brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.

451
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,180
 The judge is standing at the door.

452
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,500
 Another danger we face as a community

453
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,680
 as we wait for God to return

454
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,860
 is that we start to get impatient.

455
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,500
 And when we get impatient, it's easy to start complaining

456
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,320
 and grumbling and attacking each other.

457
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,500
 Remember what Andrew said a couple of weeks ago

458
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,660
 when we need to, the fact that we need to watch our tongues?

459
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,700
 When we get impatient and grumble,

460
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,660
 we tend then to speak words that are unkind, right?

461
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,060
 Words of death rather than words of life.

462
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,940
 And in these last days, this is what Jesus

463
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,900
 is looking after for, he's especially concerned

464
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,940
 about his people and his church.

465
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,300
 But when we grumble against each other,

466
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,280
 when we fight and we quarrel,

467
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,340
 we cannot be the unified body of Christ

468
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,900
 that he has called us to be.

469
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,620
 We cannot be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.

470
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,800
 When we're busy attacking each other,

471
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,860
 how can we be that voice that speaks out

472
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,320
 for the innocent and those who are suffering injustice?

473
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,100
 When we're so caught up with the splinter

474
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,720
 in each other's eyes, how can we see the evil

475
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,420
 that is happening around us?

476
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,660
 This is why James reminds us, right?

477
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,420
 Don't think just because we're not like those rich oppressors

478
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,020
 that he was talking about at the beginning,

479
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,860
 that God isn't coming to judge us either.

480
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,420
 We should be speaking and acting as if Jesus

481
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,520
 was right at the gates, right at the door.

482
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,180
 Maybe even imagining him putting his ear against the door,

483
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,700
 seeing what's happening inside.

484
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,380
 Any time to open the door, and when he does enter,

485
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,360
 how is he gonna find his church?

486
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,700
 How is he gonna find his people?

487
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,420
 Fighting and grumbling or steadfastly and patiently

488
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,740
 doing the work that he has called us to do.

489
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,580
 And finally, James calls us to also be patient in suffering

490
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:40,100
 because the call to patience here isn't the kind of patience

491
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,740
 just enough just to wait for a few extra minutes

492
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,020
 for a coffee to be made.

493
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,620
 The patience that God is looking for

494
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,020
 is the steadfast kind of patience

495
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,540
 that even when things aren't going our way,

496
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,940
 we hold on to his promises.

497
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,340
 Even in the toughest of situations.

498
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,060
 And to make his point, James asks us to consider the prophets

499
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,000
 consider the prophets and the things they had to go through.

500
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,140
 Now I both love and I'm terrified by the fact

501
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,500
 that James tells us that we need to be patient in suffering

502
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,940
 and then he turns us to the prophets.

503
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,820
 And even though he doesn't mention any prophet

504
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,020
 in particular by name, if you read through the Old Testament

505
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,780
 and the things the prophets had to go through, right?

506
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,860
 They had to suffer through all kinds of stuff in God's name.

507
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,300
 And in fact, it was often God himself

508
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,700
 who calls his prophets into seasons

509
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,860
 of perseverance and suffering.

510
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,140
 Look at Jeremiah for a second.

511
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,980
 Jeremiah was a man of God, but this man of God

512
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,340
 endured constant persecution, ridicule, and death threats

513
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,380
 all through his ministry.

514
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,100
 Everybody mocked him.

515
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,460
 Everyone was trying to convince him to shut up,

516
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,140
 just denounce God, stop talking about it.

517
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,820
 But even when he himself tried to shut up,

518
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,420
 he said this, these were his words.

519
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,460
 His word in my heart is like a fire,

520
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,860
 a fire shut up in my bones.

521
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,260
 I'm weary of holding it in.

522
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,460
 Indeed, I cannot.

523
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,460
 Right, this quote sounds cool and we like it, you know.

524
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,000
 But you know, this was Jeremiah speaking

525
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,820
 out of a place of desperation.

526
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,660
 This was Jeremiah saying,

527
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,580
 "Yeah, I'd rather be doing anything else."

528
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,740
 You know the amount of stuff I've been through

529
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,860
 as I speak God's name.

530
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,300
 I would rather be doing anything else

531
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,740
 than speak God's word that he tells me to.

532
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,640
 But yet he chooses to anyway.

533
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,780
 And he patiently suffers and endures

534
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,980
 even though he knows the positions it's gonna land him in.

535
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,700
 Take Ezekiel, right, doing something

536
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,380
 that made no sense to anyone.

537
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,140
 God told him to lay on his side for 390 days

538
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,940
 in an illustration to God calling him

539
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,060
 to demonstrate how many days Israel

540
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,340
 had been lost in their sin, right.

541
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,340
 Lying down on his side, 390 days,

542
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,060
 just lying there like that, right.

543
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,560
 I don't know if you'd be patient enough to suffer that.

544
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,460
 Take Hosea, who had to patiently endure his wife

545
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:13,540
 running off to other men time and time and time again.

546
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,100
 Yet God kept telling him, "You have to keep loving her.

547
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,880
 "You have to keep pursuing her.

548
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,100
 "Never, do not leave her side."

549
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:26,860
 God uses us in patient suffering.

550
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,700
 So if you're suffering for Jesus right now,

551
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,460
 take heart, you are not alone.

552
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,240
 You are never alone.

553
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,700
 And in the meanwhile, know that your character

554
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,340
 is being forged through these seasons of difficulty.

555
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,540
 God uses it to transform us.

556
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,660
 Back in chapter one of James, he says this,

557
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,960
 "Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial

558
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,520
 "because he has stood the test.

559
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,300
 "That is the person who will receive the crown of life

560
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,700
 "that the Lord has promised to those who love him."

561
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,180
 As we remember these things, as we practice patience

562
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,420
 in the Lord with each other in our suffering,

563
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,780
 remember this too, that the Lord is full

564
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,760
 of compassion and mercy.

565
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,480
 See, as we look through these things,

566
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,240
 it might seem like God is this angry and fiery judge,

567
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,040
 itching to come back so he can show everybody what's up.

568
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,680
 That's not his heart, really.

569
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,320
 And time and time again, more often than not,

570
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,440
 scripture reminds us that God is full of mercy.

571
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,740
 He is full of compassion, that his love is everlasting,

572
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,140
 that his blessings go beyond a thousand generations,

573
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,800
 that he sacrificed his son in order to show us his love.

574
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,780
 And ultimately, his nature is not to punish and to slaughter

575
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,020
 even though that is a consequence,

576
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,500
 but it is to bless and to love.

577
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,900
 So when we're patient in the Lord,

578
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,400
 the result is always to come into his blessings in our life.

579
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,420
 Now, those might come in all sorts of ways.

580
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,100
 I'm not saying prosperity gospel here.

581
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
 Don't hear me wrong, okay?

582
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,900
 But what I'm telling you is this,

583
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,020
 in all the suffering that we have to go through

584
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,060
 in the name of Jesus, if we persevere,

585
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,100
 if we keep our faith in him, he will restore you,

586
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,300
 he will come through for you in his will,

587
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,420
 in his way, and in his time.

588
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,340
 So we hold on to patience, church.

589
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,780
 And one thing we cling on to in this journey of patience

590
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,620
 is prayer.

591
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,860
 We have to have prayer.

592
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,280
 Prayer is like one of those immovable building blocks

593
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,620
 of our relationship with Jesus.

594
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,180
 Prayer is one of those amazing privileges

595
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,740
 that we get as the children of God.

596
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,340
 But if we're honest, prayer is also a bit of a mystery,

597
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,340
 because it's hard to fully understand how it works.

598
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,260
 When you try to explain prayer to someone

599
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,540
 without any kind of faith at all,

600
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,100
 it might sound like some sort of ramblings of a mad person.

601
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,780
 People might think you're crazy.

602
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,860
 You're talking, what are you,

603
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,060
 talking to a magical sky fairy?

604
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,660
 You just whisper your wishes into the air,

605
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,480
 and you're just hoping that something's gonna happen.

606
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,340
 Somehow it's gonna make a difference.

607
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,560
 Well, even in secular culture, so that's one side of it.

608
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,800
 But on the other side of it,

609
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,900
 for people who don't have a faith in Jesus,

610
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,820
 maybe sometimes prayer seems like

611
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,180
 some sort of cosmic slot machine.

612
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,140
 So you launch a prayer into the sky,

613
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,220
 and it's like pulling a wheel and pulling a handle

614
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,020
 to see if you come up with a jackpot.

615
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,320
 Ding, ding, ding, yes, my prayer's got answered this time.

616
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,460
 Or you just throw a prayer.

617
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,220
 Bon Jovi has a whole song about it.

618
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,700
 You're living on a prayer.

619
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,180
 You see what happens.

620
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,460
 I'm just gonna say these words,

621
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,280
 but I don't know who it really is going to.

622
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,520
 I'm just gonna hope for the best.

623
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,140
 James gives us no room to doubt the power of prayer

624
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,100
 and the absolute essential role

625
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,420
 that plays in our relationship with Jesus.

626
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,260
 And we have to pray in all circumstances, in all situations.

627
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,660
 He says, "As if are you in trouble?

628
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,920
 "Is there anyone among you in trouble?

629
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,720
 "Let them pray.

630
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,540
 "If you are happy, let them sing songs of praise.

631
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,280
 "If anyone among you is sick,

632
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,820
 "let them call the elders of the church to pray over them,

633
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,540
 "and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.

634
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,380
 "And the prayer offered in faith

635
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,960
 "will make the sick person well.

636
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,040
 "The Lord will raise them up.

637
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,220
 "If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."

638
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,340
 Right, what a beautiful contrast this is

639
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,840
 from the type of community we started the message with.

640
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,460
 Right, in the beginning, we saw people out for themselves,

641
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,140
 living in indulgence, you know,

642
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,280
 and being unjust to each other.

643
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,220
 But James is letting us know that when we're able

644
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,680
 to put the material things aside,

645
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,300
 when our focus and our heart's desire is made right,

646
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,820
 not to abuse and take advantage of each other,

647
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,780
 but rather, now the focus becomes on ministering

648
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,180
 to each other, to loving each other,

649
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,620
 to praying for each other, to making sure

650
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,060
 that we're taking care of the sick,

651
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,420
 of offering prayers of faith.

652
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,900
 This is the kind of church Jesus is looking for.

653
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,380
 This is what it looks like when heaven meets earth.

654
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,340
 This is what it means to bring hope to this world.

655
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,380
 Because when we pray church,

656
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,340
 we are not talking into thin air.

657
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,780
 Prayer's not a cosmic slot machine.

658
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,520
 When we pray church, we are giving our petitions

659
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,900
 to the King of Kings, the all-powerful,

660
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,460
 all-merciful, all-loving God who loves everybody,

661
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,940
 the one who is able to do all things.

662
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,580
 This is precisely why prayer works,

663
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,540
 because God is who he says he is,

664
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,580
 because he is close to us.

665
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,860
 And this is why when we pray, we can have one foot

666
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,580
 in the mess and the craziness and the suffering

667
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,740
 that we all have to face in life,

668
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,180
 but the other foot knowing full well God is who he says he is

669
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,180
 and that he is good, he is merciful, he is just,

670
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,660
 he is there for us in our time of need.

671
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,980
 We stand firm on his promises when we pray,

672
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,980
 no matter what we are facing.

673
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,740
 If we're in trouble, we can pray.

674
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,800
 If we're happy, we can pray.

675
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,180
 We sing these songs, we pray this way

676
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,500
 because we know who God is.

677
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,540
 But there's one more component about prayer

678
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,740
 that makes it even more beautiful.

679
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,420
 And it's the reason why we're sitting gathered

680
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,300
 here today, it's the reason, it should be the reason

681
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,820
 why you're coming every single Sunday

682
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,820
 to a gathering like this.

683
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,460
 It should be the reason why you're gathering

684
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,380
 in your community groups or your friendship groups.

685
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,800
 It's because prayer isn't just you and the Lord.

686
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,900
 Prayer is something that God wants us to do

687
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,700
 as a community, together, as brothers and sisters,

688
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,220
 as family, right?

689
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,860
 And this is one of the wonderful things

690
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,960
 about knowing Jesus and being part of his family

691
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,760
 is that we can count on other people

692
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,860
 to pray for us as well.

693
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,660
 James says here, if you're sick, call the elders,

694
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,240
 the faithful, the righteous people to pray for you.

695
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,460
 And let me tell you, church, that our elders

696
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,660
 here at the Vine are faithful and righteous people.

697
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,900
 The colleagues I have the honor to work with

698
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,160
 are faithful and righteous people.

699
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,200
 So this is a part of the Bible we can take literally.

700
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,660
 If you are sick, if you are in need,

701
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,840
 call us, we're here for you, we want to pray for you,

702
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,000
 we want to hear what you're going through.

703
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,940
 Come and pray in faith with us

704
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,760
 and we will pray and we will ask God in faith,

705
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,680
 we will bring your petitions before God

706
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,140
 and allow his will to be done.

707
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,720
 But I also want us to hear this as well

708
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,640
 and really hear this, right?

709
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,480
 Praying for each other in this way

710
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,860
 is not just reserved for the leaders and the elders

711
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,160
 and the pastors of this church.

712
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,720
 But every single person who has a faith in Jesus

713
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,300
 has the right, has the access, I would even say

714
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,440
 has the responsibility to do this for each other.

715
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,320
 But we saw a beautiful example of this

716
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,000
 last week at the 11 a.m. service

717
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,400
 when Linda came forward in faith to receive prayer

718
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,840
 and in response, we as a church prayed in faith

719
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,880
 for her healing.

720
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,600
 Right, I don't know about you, but to me,

721
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,200
 that was a beautiful reflection of what the church is for.

722
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,200
 I looked on it like last week what happened

723
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,000
 was not planned at all.

724
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,720
 Right, during the 9 a.m. service, I was worshiping

725
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,960
 and I was praying and I heard the Lord say to me,

726
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,500
 you need to give people the opportunity

727
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,920
 to come forward and receive prayer

728
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,280
 'cause there's someone out there

729
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,660
 who is in need of prayer right now.

730
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,260
 So it was just a simple response of obedience

731
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,640
 to call for prayer from the church to someone in the church.

732
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,600
 And it was beautiful.

733
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,220
 It was amazing moment in the life of our family.

734
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,880
 Now could you imagine, church,

735
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
 how much more would things change

736
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,440
 if everyone in this room was dedicated

737
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,480
 to praying for each other, even outside of this space

738
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,320
 on Sunday, that constantly we're practicing

739
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,560
 our faith in this way, praying for healing,

740
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,920
 praying for miracles, praying for God's power

741
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,000
 to break through, praying for our city,

742
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,400
 praying for our families, praying for the world.

743
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,240
 The effect of this would be universe shaking, church.

744
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,080
 And this is what James is talking about.

745
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,960
 He gives us a little example of Elijah,

746
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,760
 a man of faith, who prayed that it wouldn't rain

747
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,960
 and it didn't rain, and then he prayed for rain

748
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
 and then it rained.

749
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,400
 James tells us this, you see, prayer really works.

750
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,440
 There is an effect.

751
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,160
 We're not talking to nobody.

752
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,080
 We're talking to our all-powerful, loving Creator

753
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,600
 in heaven, we are talking to our Savior

754
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,000
 when we join voices in prayer

755
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,720
 and make our petitions known to Him.

756
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,000
 And it's not just physical healing.

757
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,920
 It's also for the healing of souls.

758
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,440
 Prayer has the ability to change our destiny,

759
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,400
 our situations right here on this earth,

760
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,180
 but also in the life to come as well.

761
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,220
 And there's a kind of healing that takes place

762
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,220
 when we pray because it's able to save us from our sin.

763
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:54,840
 See, above all things, sin is the most destructive force

764
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,880
 in our lives, and we've all experienced this.

765
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,040
 We go against God's will.

766
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,840
 We take things into our own hands.

767
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,520
 We go when God says stop.

768
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,200
 We let the lust of our eyes and the desires of our flesh

769
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,160
 get the better of us.

770
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,780
 We use our words to tear down instead of build up,

771
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,300
 and we fight, we quarrel, we gossip.

772
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,700
 We become friends with the world,

773
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,360
 and we turn our backs to God.

774
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,340
 We have envy and selfish ambition.

775
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,140
 We show favoritism to people.

776
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,080
 We ignore the needs of the poor.

777
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,880
 Sin will 100% absolutely tear you apart,

778
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,760
 tear your relationship with God apart,

779
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,180
 and tear your relationship with other people apart.

780
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,600
 That is the destructive power of sin.

781
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,980
 So what do we do?

782
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,480
 We pray, and we confess.

783
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,760
 James says it this way.

784
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,640
 Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other

785
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,800
 so that you may be healed.

786
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,120
 And confession is one of those things

787
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,140
 that's become a bit lost because it's scary.

788
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,160
 It is a bit scary.

789
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,520
 It's hard to confess sin, right?

790
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,960
 And when we do it, we feel like there's a certain shame

791
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,240
 that comes because we don't want people

792
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,840
 to see the mess we're in.

793
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,140
 And so we hide, and we don't allow other people to know.

794
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:21,440
 But I think all of us in this room have also felt this too.

795
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,080
 Every time we hide our sin, right,

796
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,560
 we are actually playing directly

797
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,760
 into what the enemy wants us to do with it.

798
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,920
 And when we don't deal with sin,

799
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,900
 we give it the opportunity to grow, right?

800
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,520
 It's like a mold that just festers in the dark,

801
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,680
 and the longer you don't deal with it,

802
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,080
 the more it will grow and destroy your relationship

803
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,800
 with God and others.

804
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,120
 Paul describes it as like a web that so easily entangles us

805
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,800
 that it was like we're covered in these webs.

806
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,180
 The more we try to struggle ourselves to get out of it,

807
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,960
 the bigger the mess we find ourselves in.

808
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,280
 That is what sin does to us.

809
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,100
 And James lets us know here, there is a way out.

810
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,960
 One of the ways we deal with it,

811
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,300
 the way to deal with sin is through confession.

812
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,780
 Yes, it's scary.

813
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,740
 It's hard to do.

814
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,960
 And I've been in those situations

815
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,020
 where I know I've messed up,

816
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,680
 and I know I need to open my mouth

817
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,840
 and admit what I've done wrong,

818
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,000
 confess my sin to those who I've sinned against.

819
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,440
 And I've been in small groups too,

820
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,800
 where there's been a group of us people

821
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,160
 that have been walking together,

822
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,440
 and one of the brothers has come up,

823
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,440
 and he's confessed things that he's been losing himself to,

824
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,600
 sin that he's been wrestling with.

825
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,360
 And yes, there are consequences.

826
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
 This is not like a magic eraser.

827
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,120
 Everything makes better immediately

828
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,920
 when we confess our sin.

829
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,160
 There are consequences to deal with,

830
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,700
 because sin is messy,

831
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,840
 and it does take time to figure things out

832
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,200
 and pick up the pieces.

833
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,660
 But know this too, church.

834
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,320
 The end result when we confess

835
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,480
 is always a step towards restoration and healing.

836
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,120
 And I believe some of us are sitting in this room today,

837
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,500
 and you are suffering greatly because of your sin.

838
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,040
 And you feel like you're in anguish

839
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,980
 because of where your sin has led you to.

840
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,780
 And you're sick and tired of the power

841
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,940
 that sin has over you.

842
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,120
 Listen to these words.

843
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,760
 God can free you if you would allow yourself

844
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,560
 to embrace confession,

845
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,280
 come alongside a brother and sister,

846
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,680
 confess your sin with us together in front of the Lord

847
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,200
 so that you can be healed.

848
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,800
 Now I'm not saying everybody come up

849
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,280
 and grab the microphone right now

850
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,480
 and air all your dirty laundry here.

851
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,800
 That's not the point.

852
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,080
 But it is being honest about where you are.

853
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,560
 It is asking God to help you,

854
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,320
 and it is inviting someone who you trust,

855
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,720
 someone else who loves the Lord to come alongside you,

856
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,040
 to tell them what you're struggling,

857
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,600
 tell them what you're going through.

858
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,800
 I've had this addiction that I can't get rid of.

859
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,440
 I've hurt people in this way.

860
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,080
 I've been dishonest with my family.

861
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,760
 I've been dishonest in my practices and business.

862
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,540
 Whatever the sin is,

863
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,720
 what would it be like if we had a community

864
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,200
 that was able, honest enough with each other,

865
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,880
 that loves the Lord enough, that loves each other enough

866
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,280
 that we could confess these things freely

867
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,160
 within our community so that we can find healing?

868
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,120
 And in fact, I do believe this is something

869
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,080
 that the Lord has been growing us in

870
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,120
 as a church of the vine,

871
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,640
 especially throughout this year.

872
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,640
 We've seen beautiful moments of people gathering together

873
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,700
 to pray for those who are hurting,

874
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,000
 to pray for those who are lost in sin.

875
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,200
 We have had moments when sin has been confessed

876
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,680
 and people have found healing and restoration

877
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,420
 as a part of that process.

878
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,100
 So this is the task at Hand Church.

879
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,940
 Are we willing to do these things?

880
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,960
 In the light of Jesus returning,

881
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,600
 he has called us to be an active,

882
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,320
 a steadfast, a patient community of faith

883
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,860
 that looks forward to Jesus coming back.

884
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,480
 And is tirelessly working to welcome him when he does.

885
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,600
 This is the power of God at work

886
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,680
 in our lives and in the church.

887
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,960
 So the question is, after these five weeks,

888
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,700
 how should we respond?

889
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,140
 And time is short.

890
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,900
 We have no time to lose.

891
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,000
 And James has called us to a genuine, active,

892
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,520
 righteous, loyal, and prayer-filled faith.

893
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,980
 Will we respond to this church?

894
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,780
 If you would close your eyes for a second

895
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,980
 and just allow the Lord to speak to you right now.

896
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:11,780
 You know, and over the past five weeks,

897
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,100
 perhaps God has used different parts

898
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,140
 of this series to talk to you.

899
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,440
 Maybe it was in a moment of worship.

900
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,500
 Maybe it was in the prayer line.

901
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,540
 Maybe it was through one of the messages that we've heard.

902
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:42,140
 And the Lord loves us too much not to leave us

903
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,940
 with instructions and his desires for us.

904
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,520
 (gentle music)

905
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:56,300
 And so Jesus, I pray that as a community,

906
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,940
 that we would encourage each other in this way always.

907
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:05,480
 That you would keep our minds and our hearts fixed on you.

908
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,500
 That we would always be a voice that cries out

909
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,340
 on behalf of those who have no voice.

910
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,920
 (gentle music)

911
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,620
 That we would always be steadfast in our faith.

912
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:26,340
 Not double-minded, not hot and cold,

913
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:34,500
 but fully focused and sold out completely

914
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,700
 to your love at work in our lives.

915
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,860
 That the way we speak of each other

916
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,060
 would always be honoring and uplifting.

917
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,500
 That our loyalty to you is true,

918
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,000
 even when we face the temptations of this world.

919
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,420
 And that we are patiently waiting,

920
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,860
 actively working towards building your kingdom

921
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,820
 here on this earth.

922
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,460
 Jesus, we know you hear our prayer.

923
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,300
 And so Father, help us in this journey.

924
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,560
 And until we see you again face to face, Lord,

925
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,760
 guide us and lead us in your love.

926
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,420
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

927
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,000
 (gentle music)

928
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,580
 (gentle music)

929
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:42,580
