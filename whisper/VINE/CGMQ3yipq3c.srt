1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
 Can we thank Carla for just being amazing as always?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,160
 So good.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,160
 Well, welcome to The Vine.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,760
 My name's Andrew, one of the pastors here.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,400
 And there's probably a lot of you

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,040
 that are visiting with us this weekend.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,960
 And we are so, so glad that you are with us and amongst us.

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,920
 And I know there's loads of people

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,960
 in the overflow right now.

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,360
 So I wanted to say hi to everybody in the overflow.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,200
 Thank you guys for being willing to sit in the overflow.

12
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,760
 And then everybody that's sitting on the floor

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,600
 and everything crazy.

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,840
 Anyway, we're so glad you guys are here.

15
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,000
 A number of years ago,

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,480
 I was invited to speak at a church overseas.

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,400
 And this happens a number of times for me.

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,760
 And it's always a great privilege to travel overseas,

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,600
 to speak in other churches and other contexts.

20
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,920
 But every time I get invited to speak overseas,

21
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,280
 I know that I, as well as being excited,

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,640
 I know that I'm also gonna be exhausted

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,360
 because these trips are like full on.

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,360
 From the moment that the pastor from that church

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,800
 picks you up at the airport

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,880
 to the moment that they drop you back at the airport,

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,920
 like three days later, you are on 24/7.

28
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,560
 It is crazy.

29
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,840
 They expect you not just to speak in their church,

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,480
 but they expect you to sort of pastor all their people,

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,920
 pray for everybody, solve all the problems of the church,

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,760
 work out why their finances are not right,

33
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,200
 visit with their eldership and solve all the problems there

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,840
 and strategically believe for everything.

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,120
 You're supposed to have a prophetic word

36
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,720
 for every single person in the church.

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,680
 The whole thing is crazy.

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,040
 And it is a great privilege.

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,640
 Honestly, one of the great privileges to go there.

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,880
 I love what I do.

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
 And when I'm getting invited to go do that,

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,400
 I'm very excited about it.

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,440
 But I recognize that I have to manage my energy.

44
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,080
 If I don't manage my energy,

45
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,040
 I know that about a day and a half into the trip,

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,880
 I will hate everybody in that church.

47
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,680
 I will be exhausted.

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,280
 Anyone here not like people when you're tired?

49
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,360
 You know, when you get tired, right?

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,760
 You get a little prickly with people.

51
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,520
 And I realized that I'm going overseas to this church.

52
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,120
 I'm representing the vine, right?

53
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,880
 I don't wanna be that guy like two days in

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,920
 who really doesn't like the people around them

55
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,320
 and is getting a little prickly with people.

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,160
 So I have to like make sure that my energy

57
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,920
 is well managed on these trips.

58
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,280
 Well, on this particular trip I went to,

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,000
 the church was larger than the vine.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,840
 They had five services on a Sunday.

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,720
 I was speaking at all five services,

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,520
 pretty much back to back.

63
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 After the third service, I was tired.

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,480
 After the fourth service, I was a little bit wobbly.

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
 After the fifth service, I couldn't even remember my name.

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,840
 Okay, I was really exhausted.

67
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,240
 And of course it was after every service,

68
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
 they expected me to be on the prayer line.

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,640
 So I'd go down the front, I'd be on the prayer line.

70
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,440
 And it was after the fifth service,

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,040
 I'm on the prayer line after I've just preached.

72
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,120
 There's a crowd of people

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,440
 that are waiting to get prayed for me

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,960
 that the most awkward thing

75
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,760
 that perhaps has ever happened to me happens.

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,120
 There was this guy on the prayer line

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,080
 waiting for me to pray with him.

78
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,520
 He comes forward and as usual with these sort of things,

79
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,200
 we introduce ourselves and stuff.

80
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,760
 And I say to him, the thing that I say to pretty much

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
 everybody when I'm ever on a prayer line,

82
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,000
 I say to him, what is it that you would like me

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,360
 to pray for you for today?

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,640
 What is it that I can pray for you about?

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,200
 This was his response.

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,120
 He said this, "You're a man of God.

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,720
 "I don't need to tell you what my needs are.

88
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,920
 "God knows.

89
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,160
 "Just ask God and he will tell you.

90
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,240
 "I wanna see what you will say."

91
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,240
 (congregation laughing)

92
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
 Five services, okay?

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,240
 I'm exhausted and I don't like people at this point.

94
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
 All right?

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,000
 And here's this guy and I tell you what,

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
 this happens more than you might think,

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
 more than you expect.

98
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,480
 This guy comes up to me, he's basically like,

99
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,280
 I wanna see whether you're really a pastor.

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,960
 I wanna see if you really hear from God, okay?

101
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,760
 I know what my needs are, God knows, but do you know?

102
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,040
 (laughing)

103
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,600
 You're gonna have to pray about it

104
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,760
 and when you pray about it,

105
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,120
 we'll find out if you hear from the Spirit of God.

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,440
 (congregation laughing)

107
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,320
 By the way, if you're taking notes, write this down.

108
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,120
 Us pastors do not like people like this, okay?

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
 (congregation laughing)

110
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,920
 This feels like you're put under a spiritual test.

111
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,840
 It feels like they're testing you

112
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,160
 to see whether you're truly a person of the Spirit.

113
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,000
 And so this guy is speaking like this,

114
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,840
 by the way, this is on the same part

115
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,560
 as the other pet peeve that us pastors have

116
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,440
 and that's this, pastor, you prayed for me seven years ago

117
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
 and I've never seen you ever since.

118
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,880
 Do you remember what you prayed for?

119
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,880
 (congregation laughing)

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,600
 Here's the answer, no, we don't remember.

121
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
 We're like vessels, the Spirit comes in

122
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,280
 and out of us, we are not spiritual data cards

123
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,760
 that are storing everybody's spiritual issues for decades.

124
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,120
 That doesn't happen, okay, anyway.

125
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,040
 So this guy is like testing me.

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,400
 I'm, my attitude, like I am using all the remaining reserves

127
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
 of energy that I have to try to be calm

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,800
 and nice and polite to this guy.

129
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,640
 So I said, okay, yeah, sure, let's pray.

130
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,120
 So I put my hand on his shoulder, we start to pray

131
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,800
 and I say to God, God, you know I'm tired

132
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,200
 and you know my attitude really is not good right now.

133
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,840
 But I come to you and if you have something

134
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
 you wanna say to this guy, speak to me

135
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
 and I'll pray over him.

136
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,080
 Well, as God often does with me,

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
 he gave me a visual, a visual something.

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,440
 I often see things when I'm praying for people

139
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,040
 and I saw something and I begin to pray this over this guy.

140
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,360
 About a minute into praying it,

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,640
 I realized that what I'm praying is not very positive.

142
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,560
 It's not very sort of happy.

143
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,120
 It's actually kind of a hard thing

144
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,080
 that I was praying for him about.

145
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,400
 And I kept praying and I kind of lent into

146
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,320
 what I sensed God was saying and as I prayed on,

147
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,000
 I could tell that the prayer was just a little bit heavy,

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,760
 it was a little bit, it wasn't mean,

149
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,880
 but it was just like the things that I felt

150
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,720
 like God was saying to him

151
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,440
 were not necessarily easy things to hear.

152
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,760
 And at the end of the prayer, I said amen

153
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,720
 and I opened my eyes and I was met with this face.

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
 (congregation laughing)

155
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
 And the guy says these words to me, he goes,

156
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,040
 "Uh, okay, thank you."

157
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,960
 And then he just walks off.

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
 And I'm left there like,

159
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,680
 "That is the most awkward experience I have ever had."

160
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,400
 Well, six months later, I get an email

161
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
 and the email is from this guy

162
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,760
 and he's managed to track down my email.

163
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,880
 And in the opening line of the email,

164
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,720
 I wonder if you can imagine what it said, it said this,

165
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,520
 "Pastor, you prayed for me six months ago.

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,120
 I wonder if you remember what you prayed for me about."

167
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,600
 (congregation laughing)

168
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,560
 The irony is in this case,

169
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,920
 I did actually remember what I prayed for this guy about

170
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,360
 'cause it wasn't very nice, right?

171
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,320
 And he starts to tell me in this email, he's like,

172
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,640
 "You know, you prayed for me and you said these things.

173
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,320
 And I was actually really offended in the moment

174
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,040
 and I didn't like what you said.

175
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,480
 And I walked away and out of the church that day

176
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,640
 and I was angry.

177
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
 I was angry at you.

178
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,080
 I was angry at God."

179
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,200
 And anyway, he just, this was not a pleasant email

180
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
 up to this point, right?

181
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,160
 And I was like, "Okay, great."

182
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,360
 And then he said, "But you know, God kept speaking to me

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,800
 about those words that you said over the coming weeks.

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,520
 And I kept having to bring myself back to prayer

185
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,720
 with those words.

186
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,080
 And I realized that those words that God was saying to me

187
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,800
 on that day were designed to uproot

188
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,520
 some of the deepest stuff that was in my life."

189
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,200
 And he went on to tell me some of the deep sins

190
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,760
 and the brokenness, addictions,

191
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,240
 and some things that he had in his life.

192
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,360
 And as the email went on, he said,

193
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,840
 "You know, I was able, it took me about six months,

194
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,280
 but I've been able to reach out to my wife."

195
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
 It turned out that him and his wife

196
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,320
 had been separated for some time.

197
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,880
 And he reached out to his wife and he repented with her

198
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,720
 and apologized for some things.

199
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,320
 And he said, "We've gotten back together

200
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,200
 and we're trying to make marriage work again.

201
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,040
 And I just wanted to let you know

202
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,320
 that although I treated you rudely in the moment,

203
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,280
 that those things that you said disrupted stuff."

204
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,480
 He goes, he actually said this.

205
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,720
 He said, "I didn't wanna hear what you said,

206
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,520
 but it disrupted some things in me

207
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,480
 that needed to get disrupted."

208
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,560
 And he said, "I just want you to know

209
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,200
 that I'm in a better place now."

210
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,200
 I wonder if you've ever experienced God

211
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,960
 saying something to you that is not easy for you to hear,

212
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,560
 that is not comfortable to hear.

213
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,360
 I wonder if any of us have ever experienced

214
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,440
 when God speaks to us in a way that

215
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,440
 kinda just comes in and disrupts some things in us.

216
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,320
 It's not easy, is it?

217
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,560
 I think as Christians, we often think that

218
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
 when God speaks to his people,

219
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,920
 he's always gonna speak super positive things.

220
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,320
 That when God speaks to his people,

221
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,800
 it's always gonna be kind of a feel good thing.

222
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
 It's always gonna make me feel good.

223
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,160
 It's always gonna be great.

224
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,000
 It's always gonna be wonderful.

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,040
 And I think us Christians get so conditioned

226
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
 into thinking that that's always how God speaks,

227
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,640
 that when God shows up and says something

228
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,760
 that's slightly different to what we expected

229
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,240
 or says something that we weren't quite

230
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,720
 kind of wanting to hear or whatever it might be,

231
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,080
 we often, as Christians, I think, reject that.

232
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
 We think, "Oh, that's probably not God.

233
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,840
 That can't be God.

234
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,160
 God wouldn't say something like that."

235
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,440
 And we kinda push away from it.

236
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,240
 And I think we have this problem as Christians sometimes,

237
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,000
 'cause we're always expecting God to show up a certain way,

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,440
 but when he shows up in a different way,

239
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,520
 we really struggle with that.

240
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,120
 Am I the only person here who struggles with that?

241
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,720
 I am, I guess, the only person here who struggles with that.

242
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,800
 I'm assuming that more of you also do.

243
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,960
 Here's the reality that I think I've come to learn

244
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,280
 about God that I think is actually a very important thing

245
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,680
 for us to grasp, and it's this,

246
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,280
 that sometimes when God speaks,

247
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,600
 the very thing you need to hear the most

248
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,920
 is often the very thing you want to hear the least.

249
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,560
 Come on, church.

250
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,200
 So often when God speaks to us,

251
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,320
 the very thing we need to hear the most

252
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
 is often the very thing we want to hear the least.

253
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,560
 That actually is a really good summary

254
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,400
 of the first Christmas that happened some 2,000 years ago.

255
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,720
 See, when Matthew and Luke present the birth story of Jesus,

256
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
 they present it in a raw and very real way.

257
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,040
 And yes, it's a story of incredible moments,

258
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,400
 a story of choirs of angels and God's birth,

259
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
 the incarnation and the glory and the peace

260
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
 that is exclaimed during that time.

261
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,320
 But if the story of Jesus' birth is anything,

262
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
 it's a story of a God who speaks

263
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,200
 and a God who longs to speak to his people.

264
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,440
 But if you trace through the story,

265
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,360
 you'll see very quickly that so often the things

266
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,160
 that God speaks to the characters in the Christmas story

267
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,080
 is not the things that they were expecting to hear.

268
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,680
 It's not the things that they even perhaps wanted to hear.

269
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,720
 Take Zachariah, for example.

270
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,800
 God shows up in an angel through Gabriel and says to him,

271
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,520
 hey, because of your unfaithfulness,

272
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,000
 you're now not gonna be able to talk

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,400
 until your wife, Elizabeth, gives birth.

274
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,480
 Take Joseph, for example.

275
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,680
 Joseph, having discovered that his unmarried,

276
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,440
 pregnant fiancee is now pregnant with a child

277
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,240
 that came from the Holy Spirit,

278
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,640
 and he understands the shame

279
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,800
 that will come upon him and upon Mary,

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
 and so he's making plans in his mind

281
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,000
 to do the right thing for her and for him,

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,520
 and which is to separate their relationship.

283
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
 And God steps in and says,

284
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,440
 no, you can't separate that relationship.

285
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,800
 You're actually gonna have to walk into that shame,

286
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,280
 walk into that pain, 'cause I've got a bigger thing

287
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
 that's happening here.

288
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,160
 Well, think about the shepherds.

289
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,480
 The shepherds who were faithfully looking after their sheep,

290
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,120
 which was their livelihood,

291
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,560
 God shows up in the form of angels and says,

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
 leave your livelihood behind and go into Bethlehem.

293
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
 Just drop everything that you've worked hard for,

294
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,080
 because we've got a new thing

295
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,320
 that we want to happen in your life.

296
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,360
 Isn't it so interesting for us that we have a plan A

297
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,720
 that we think is our plan A,

298
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,040
 but so often God comes and says,

299
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,280
 there's actually a B, C, and a D

300
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,240
 that is really the thing that's gonna set you alight,

301
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
 really the thing that's gonna make you as a person,

302
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,960
 really the thing that's gonna flourish you

303
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,000
 and bring you into the fullness of who you are.

304
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,840
 I mean, just think about Mary.

305
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,120
 God shows up to Mary and says some pretty crazy things,

306
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,040
 things that she must've been so confused by,

307
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,520
 so overwhelmed by,

308
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,800
 not things that she was expecting God to say to her.

309
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
 In fact, I think if Mary had the choice,

310
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
 she would have chosen not to be in a part

311
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,040
 of the whole Christmas story in the first place.

312
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,640
 Imagine the shame that she had to hold.

313
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,080
 Imagine the months that she had to go through

314
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,600
 where people thought all this stuff about her.

315
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,360
 If she had the choice, she probably would have said,

316
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,840
 I didn't even wanna go anywhere near that story

317
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,480
 or that thing whatsoever.

318
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,200
 And I think this is fascinating,

319
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,640
 that in the heart of the Christmas story,

320
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,680
 you see something that is so important

321
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,440
 for all of us to understand about how God works in our lives.

322
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,840
 And it's this, that your personal preferences

323
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,040
 and your personal choice

324
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,200
 is not always the most important things in God's mind

325
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,480
 when it comes to his leadership of your life.

326
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,900
 I know this is not the Christmas message

327
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,160
 you were hoping to hear,

328
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,800
 but I wanna encourage you to stay in with me

329
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,420
 because I think there's something important

330
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,520
 that you need to hear.

331
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,680
 Our personal choices and our personal preferences

332
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 are not always God's most forefront things in his mind

333
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,280
 when he thinks about you and his leadership of his life,

334
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,760
 and he sees you, he sees your future,

335
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,040
 he sees where he's leading you in his life.

336
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,760
 And he says, I know what's ahead,

337
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,920
 and I know all the good things,

338
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,960
 I know the bad things, I know the ugly things,

339
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,840
 and you want plan A,

340
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,920
 but I've got this other plan over here.

341
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,520
 Your personal preference is to go down this path,

342
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,000
 but if you go down that path,

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,260
 I tell you in five years time,

344
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,400
 you're gonna hit rock bottom.

345
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,120
 But if you were to listen to me,

346
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,480
 if you were just to come with me,

347
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,520
 I've got a new path that I'm gonna take you down.

348
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,760
 And this is the way that will bring flourishing

349
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,520
 and growth and life to your personal choices

350
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,400
 and preferences, they're important to God,

351
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,480
 but they're not the most important thing to him.

352
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,440
 He sees stuff that you will never see,

353
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,360
 and in faithfulness and trust,

354
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,920
 we are to turn to his word.

355
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,560
 Are you following this?

356
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,420
 But sometimes the word that God brings is challenging.

357
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,000
 It's hard to hear.

358
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,700
 And it comes and disrupts some things in us.

359
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,720
 Case in point is exactly what happens

360
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,760
 at the end of the Christmas story.

361
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,640
 The story that Luke is presenting to us

362
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,480
 of the birth of Jesus,

363
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,760
 he adds a very important story right at the end.

364
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,040
 It's almost like an epilogue to the story, if you will.

365
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
 It's the moment where Mary and Joseph,

366
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,480
 having had the child Jesus,

367
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,280
 Jesus is now eight days old.

368
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,720
 And from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,

369
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,240
 they make the journey from Bethlehem to Jerusalem,

370
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,840
 and they go into the temple when Jesus is eight days old,

371
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,800
 and they're carrying him in

372
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,360
 because the ritual at the time,

373
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,800
 the tradition at the time,

374
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,520
 was that faithful Jewish families

375
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,960
 would take their firstborn son

376
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,760
 and bring him into the temple to be dedicated to the Lord.

377
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
 And that dedication ceremony

378
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,840
 involved the act of circumcision.

379
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,160
 And so this was what Mary and Joseph were doing.

380
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,240
 They're faithful Jewish people

381
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,520
 going to the temple on the eighth day with Jesus,

382
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,880
 taking him into the temple

383
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,160
 in order for him to be dedicated

384
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,080
 and for the circumcision ceremony to take place.

385
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,760
 And when they're in the house of God,

386
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,120
 something awkward happens.

387
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,160
 A little bit like me standing in that prayer line

388
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,000
 and that man coming forward.

389
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,780
 For Mary and Joseph,

390
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,160
 something significantly awkward takes place.

391
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,440
 Let me actually break this down for you

392
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,480
 from Luke chapter two, starting in verse 25.

393
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,960
 Everybody still okay?

394
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,680
 Do you still like me?

395
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,680
 I'm really, if you're visiting, I'm really a nice person.

396
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,000
 Trust me, I am, I am.

397
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,360
 But hang with us.

398
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,600
 Verse 25 of chapter two of the Christmas story.

399
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,720
 Now, there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon

400
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,400
 who was righteous and devout.

401
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,600
 He was waiting for the consolation of Israel

402
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,440
 and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

403
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit

404
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,840
 that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

405
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,400
 That's the Messiah.

406
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,560
 Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts

407
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,520
 when the parents, that's Mary and Joseph,

408
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,000
 brought in the child Jesus

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,120
 to do for him what was custom of the Lord,

410
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,280
 that the law required, that's the circumcision.

411
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,680
 Simeon took the baby into his arms

412
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,200
 and praised God, saying this.

413
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,280
 Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,

414
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,520
 now dismiss your servant in peace.

415
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,760
 For my eyes have seen your salvation,

416
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,120
 which you have prepared in the sight of all people,

417
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,160
 a light for revelation to the Gentiles

418
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,740
 and for glory to your people Israel.

419
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,180
 Up until this point in the story,

420
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,240
 everything is going perfectly right.

421
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,120
 This is wonderful.

422
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,400
 And Luke is creating and writing the story

423
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,680
 to help you to see how amazing this is.

424
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,760
 There's the temple in all of its glory and beauty

425
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,800
 in the presence of God.

426
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,520
 For the very first time, the Son of God

427
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,760
 is being brought into the temple itself.

428
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,320
 There's Mary and Joseph, the faithful family,

429
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,800
 bringing their child for that dedication service.

430
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,200
 And then we're introduced

431
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,480
 to the sort of creme de la creme, Simeon.

432
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,580
 And Simeon is described by Luke

433
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,740
 in the best ways that you could ever hope

434
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,420
 to be described in the Bible.

435
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,560
 Listen to this, righteous and devout,

436
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,820
 waiting for the consolation of Israel,

437
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,380
 the Holy Spirit upon him.

438
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,980
 Luke is saying, this man is righteous.

439
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,420
 He hasn't put a foot wrong.

440
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,980
 This man loves the Lord.

441
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,540
 He's devout in his devotion to God.

442
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,580
 He is waiting for the Messiah to come.

443
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,180
 He's so excited that one day God would step

444
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,500
 into the world with the Messiah.

445
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,800
 Not only that, but he's filled with the Holy Spirit.

446
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,500
 I mean, you can't paint somebody

447
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,300
 in a better light than that.

448
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,700
 Righteous, devout, waiting for God,

449
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,420
 filled with the Holy Spirit.

450
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,060
 And the Holy Spirit takes Simeon

451
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,620
 and he walks into the temple courts

452
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,300
 and he sees the baby Jesus

453
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,260
 and he sweeps up Jesus in his arms.

454
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,780
 And notice what he says.

455
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,260
 He says, "This is a light for revelation to the Gentiles

456
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,920
 and glory to your people, Israel."

457
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,040
 You could not say a better thing about baby Jesus,

458
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,460
 that he's gonna be the light of revelation to the Gentiles.

459
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,580
 I love that the Christmas story brings us the picture

460
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,140
 of Jesus's mission to the world.

461
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,940
 That anyone who was not Jewish,

462
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,020
 that's the majority of us in this room,

463
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,860
 we can come to the saving knowledge of God

464
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,100
 through Jesus Christ.

465
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,660
 He's a light of revelation to all of us here in Hong Kong.

466
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,100
 But he's also the glory to Israel.

467
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,540
 He's also gonna do all the things

468
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,920
 that the scriptures had prophesied

469
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,700
 about what was gonna happen to Israel.

470
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,320
 He was gonna be their Messiah and their Christ.

471
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,560
 And Simeon sweeps up baby Jesus in his arms

472
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,360
 and says all these incredible stuff.

473
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,040
 And you can imagine Joseph and Mary standing there

474
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,400
 and thinking, "This is the most amazing thing

475
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
 I have ever heard.

476
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,500
 This is the best thing I could ever hear about my child."

477
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,720
 I mean, think about this from your perspective.

478
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,800
 Imagine if you had a baby

479
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,880
 and you come into the vine on a Sunday,

480
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,920
 it would be like one of the pastors from the vine

481
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,240
 sweeping up your child in their arms

482
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,040
 and going, "This one, this one is destined to go to Harvard

483
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,120
 and graduate from the top of his class.

484
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,680
 This one will be a millionaire by the age of 30,

485
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,720
 for he will become a doctor or a lawyer or a banker.

486
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,460
 This one will master the piano and the violin

487
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,080
 and will speak 13 languages.

488
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,280
 And even in your old age, you will be blessed

489
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,880
 'cause this one will look after you."

490
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,880
 Every Hong Kong family would say, "Praise the Lord.

491
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,600
 Are you with me?"

492
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,360
 That's what it was like for Mary and Joseph, okay?

493
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,560
 This was their Harvard moment, all right?

494
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,160
 The child will be a light of revelation to Gentiles.

495
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,040
 He's going to be the glory to Israel.

496
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,520
 It could not get better than this,

497
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,640
 which is why it says in the next verse,

498
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,240
 it says, "The child's father and mother marveled

499
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,320
 at what was said about him."

500
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 The word marveled there means they rejoiced.

501
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,120
 They were in wonder.

502
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,040
 They were in awe.

503
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,600
 This was the most amazing thing they have ever heard.

504
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,240
 And right now, Luke is basically saying,

505
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,960
 "It can't get better.

506
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,360
 Isn't God great?

507
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,320
 Isn't he saying nice things?"

508
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,760
 And then Simeon opens his mouth again.

509
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,360
 And then he puts Jesus to one side and he turns to Mary.

510
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,560
 And I want you to hear what he says to Mary.

511
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,360
 "Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother,

512
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,760
 'This child is destined to cause the falling

513
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,200
 and the rising of many in Israel

514
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
 and to be a sign that will be spoken against,

515
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed

516
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,720
 and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'"

517
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,280
 This was not in the Christmas script

518
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,520
 that was supposed to be the Christmas script.

519
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,480
 This wasn't quite as nice

520
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,040
 as what had just been spoken about Jesus.

521
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,280
 Simeon turns to Mary and he says some prophetic words

522
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,120
 over her that she did not want to hear,

523
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,440
 but she needed to hear.

524
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,800
 He says to her, first of all,

525
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,200
 that Jesus is gonna be an absolute nightmare for you.

526
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,360
 He said, "He's gonna cause the rising and the falling

527
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
 of many in Israel and will be a sign

528
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,280
 that will be spoken against."

529
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 In other words, Jesus is gonna grow up

530
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,400
 and he's gonna be a controversial figure,

531
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,920
 he's saying to Mary.

532
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,000
 He's gonna cause the falling and the rising

533
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,920
 that the contents of people's hearts

534
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,760
 are gonna be revealed

535
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,480
 and no one likes the contents of their heart

536
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,360
 to be revealed.

537
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,400
 And some people will rise with Jesus.

538
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,800
 So some people will find their greatest life

539
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 in relationship with him,

540
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,640
 but there are others who will reject him,

541
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,080
 who will not believe him,

542
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,480
 who will turn their backs on him,

543
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,720
 others who will actually speak against him.

544
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,720
 And this Jesus, he's gonna say some things.

545
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,560
 I mean, he's gonna come and he's gonna say some things

546
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,600
 that you, Mary, as his mother,

547
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,480
 you're gonna be like, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe

548
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,520
 he just said that."

549
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,560
 This is not gonna be an easy future for you, Mary.

550
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,400
 And God so loves Mary in this moment.

551
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,200
 So, I want you to see this, so loves Mary,

552
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,320
 but sees her future and knows it's gonna be hard,

553
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,240
 knows that raising the son of God is not gonna be easy.

554
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
 And so out of his love for her,

555
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,600
 he wants to prepare her and mold her

556
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,840
 and shape her into the woman that she needs to become

557
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,440
 so that she can be the mother to the son of God.

558
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,240
 And so he brings a word that she may not want to have heard,

559
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,680
 but she needed to hear in order to become the woman

560
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,920
 God wanted her to become.

561
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,440
 I mean, Jesus, can you imagine what Jesus is about to do?

562
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,960
 He's about to say things like,

563
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,560
 "Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood,

564
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,920
 you have no part of my kingdom."

565
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,040
 That one got most of his followers to leave him.

566
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,800
 He would say to the religious authorities of the day,

567
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,320
 "You brood of vipers, you whitewashed tombs."

568
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,160
 He would say to his disciples, the followers,

569
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,800
 he would say, "Unless you pick up your cross,

570
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,640
 unless you die, basically, you can't follow me."

571
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,080
 He would actually say to his best friend,

572
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,400
 he would call his best friend Satan.

573
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,760
 This is not how to win friends and influence people.

574
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,600
 And then Simeon says this.

575
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,120
 He says, "A sword will pierce your own soul too."

576
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,600
 He's not speaking, of course, of a literal sword.

577
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,920
 He's not speaking of her death in the future.

578
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,880
 He's speaking about her emotions.

579
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,160
 He's speaking about how hard it's going to be for her.

580
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,680
 And that if she's not prepared for the reality

581
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,680
 of the chance and the choices and the things,

582
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,960
 there's one point Jesus is going to,

583
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,100
 in front of his mother, say,

584
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,640
 "My mother and father is not biological.

585
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,640
 My mother and father is anyone who follows after my father."

586
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,120
 Mary is going to have a hard path.

587
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,120
 And God doesn't hold back from helping her to see

588
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,960
 that there's some tough times ahead.

589
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,440
 There's a sword that's going to feel

590
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,320
 like it pierces your soul.

591
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,400
 It's going to be difficult.

592
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,920
 And God is saying this because he's like,

593
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,980
 "I love you so much that I'm going to say

594
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,840
 the very things to you that you need to hear,

595
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,800
 even as you're holding an eight-day-old child

596
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,000
 in your hands, the future ahead for him.

597
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,480
 He is going to be the savior of the world.

598
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,760
 He is the light of revelation to Gentiles.

599
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
 He is the glory to Israel.

600
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,640
 You are going to have the joy of holding him,

601
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
 but you're also going to feel the pain

602
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,680
 that no parent wants to feel,

603
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,760
 and that is you're going to watch your child die."

604
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:18,360
 And God has so much love for Mary

605
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,460
 that he's willing to speak a hard word.

606
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,480
 God has so much love for you.

607
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,860
 God sees everything that is ahead of you.

608
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,200
 God loves you so much that he's also willing,

609
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,240
 at times, to come and speak over you

610
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,880
 and to help, perhaps, you to see that there are some things

611
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,440
 that might need to change in your life,

612
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,720
 or perhaps tell you that there are some things coming up

613
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,200
 that you need to get ready for and prepare for,

614
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,240
 'cause if you're not, it's going to be overwhelming,

615
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,160
 and it will feel like a sword has pierced your soul, too.

616
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,320
 I think sometimes, as Christians,

617
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,060
 we think that when we come to Christ Jesus,

618
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,440
 then everything's going to be absolutely perfect.

619
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,320
 The Christmas story shows us a different thing.

620
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,160
 And of course, Jesus is our life.

621
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,200
 And the wonderful thing that we celebrate at Christmastime

622
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,480
 is the arrival of our Savior and our Messiah,

623
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,880
 that when we're in relationship with him,

624
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,440
 our sin is taken care of, forgiven.

625
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,920
 We're released and filled with the fullness of God,

626
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,320
 that the same spirit that raised Jesus is found in us,

627
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,280
 and that we are found into flourishing, fullness of life,

628
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,560
 that we can know the fullness of peace, shalom,

629
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,320
 and that we'll have eternal life with him.

630
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,840
 There is so much good news in the gospel, so much there,

631
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,840
 and God so wants all of that for you

632
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,720
 that he's sometimes willing to speak something

633
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,880
 that is not going to be easy for you to hear

634
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,800
 to ensure that you remain on the path

635
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,240
 that he has for you to be on.

636
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,680
 See, Jesus is not afraid to speak a disruptive word

637
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,520
 to your perfect world if your perfect world

638
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,720
 is perfectly misaligned to his perfect will.

639
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,320
 He's not afraid to do that.

640
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,560
 And it seems weird, doesn't it, on Christmas Eve,

641
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,780
 that this would be a part of the Christmas story,

642
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,380
 but I think it's a part of the Christmas story

643
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,060
 because God is revealing his heart to his people.

644
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,820
 I'm so passionately in love with you,

645
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,900
 and I so passionately want the best for you

646
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,260
 that if there is anything in your life that is misaligned,

647
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,900
 I have the grace and the courage

648
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,700
 to lead you on a different path.

649
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,660
 I don't know about you, but I've had the disruptive word

650
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,820
 of God into my life many times over my life.

651
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,900
 I remember when I first quit my job, I was in banking here.

652
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,660
 I was one of those kids that was the banker.

653
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,100
 I wasn't a millionaire by 30, but I was a banker.

654
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,580
 And I felt God calling me out of that marketplace world

655
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,900
 into being a pastor, and so I remember quitting my job

656
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,020
 and moving with my family to New Zealand

657
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,900
 to go to Bible school,

658
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,580
 and I remember the first month in Bible school,

659
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,700
 I felt so excited.

660
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
 I felt so excited about what my future was.

661
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,780
 I could not wait to become a pastor,

662
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,580
 could not wait to become a preacher.

663
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,180
 I knew that God had called me to preach,

664
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,300
 and I was really excited to have a life

665
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,660
 where I could communicate God's word to people

666
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,540
 and speak life over people.

667
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,580
 I mean, it was everything I wanted to do.

668
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
 And I remember in the first month of Bible school,

669
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,220
 I was setting myself ready for all the studies.

670
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,180
 I wanted to learn Greek, I wanted to learn Hebrew.

671
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,180
 I wanted to understand the Bible as best I could

672
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,620
 'cause I wanted to be the best preacher

673
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,980
 of God's word that I could.

674
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,060
 And in the first month, I said to God,

675
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,140
 I said, "God, would you speak to me a word

676
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,660
 about my preaching gift?"

677
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,540
 And I was expecting that God would say,

678
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,820
 "You're awesome, Andrew.

679
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,420
 You're the best ever.

680
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,340
 You're the best.

681
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,820
 I see your future.

682
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,780
 You're gonna be the state apostle

683
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,060
 for a church called the Violet in Hong Kong,

684
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,020
 and it's gonna be amazing.

685
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,620
 And there's gonna be so many people on Christmas Eve

686
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,140
 that not only are you gonna be able to fit into the building

687
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,620
 and it's gonna be great."

688
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,660
 (congregation laughing)

689
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,660
 I was expecting a word along those kinds of lines.

690
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,900
 But God said to me, "You really want me to speak to you

691
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,460
 about your preaching gift?"

692
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,140
 And I was like, "Yeah."

693
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,180
 He's like, "Go to Amos chapter eight."

694
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,460
 So I went to Amos chapter eight, and here's what I read.

695
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,740
 "The days are coming, declares the sovereign Lord,

696
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,860
 when I will send a famine through the land,

697
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,420
 not a famine of food or of thirst for water,

698
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,980
 but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.

699
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,900
 People will stagger from sea to sea

700
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,420
 and wander from north to east,

701
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,460
 searching for the word of the Lord,

702
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,540
 but they will not find it."

703
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,740
 I had asked God to speak to me about my preaching gift,

704
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,260
 and he brings me to this passage where he's like,

705
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,380
 "Andrew, you need to understand that in your life,

706
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,060
 if you don't make some changes, a famine is coming on you,

707
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,380
 and that famine will be on hearing the word of God.

708
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,100
 And you need to understand that what makes a preacher

709
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,940
 is not how they speak the words of God,

710
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,700
 but how they hear the words of God.

711
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,100
 I am nothing if I can't hear the words of God.

712
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,020
 I am the worst pastor ever.

713
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,540
 I have nothing to say on this stage,

714
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,900
 week in and week out, if I can't hear the words of God.

715
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,740
 If I can't receive and hear something

716
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,100
 and do my best to package it and bring it to you,

717
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,900
 if I can't do that, then this is absolutely useless."

718
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,660
 And I sat there under this idea that God's saying,

719
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,180
 "You really want me to speak about your preaching gift?

720
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,780
 Here's what you need to hear.

721
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
 It's not what you want to hear, Andrew,

722
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,900
 but here's what you need to hear.

723
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,220
 A famine is coming on your life

724
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,660
 where you will be completely useless,

725
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,460
 no matter how much Bible knowledge you have,

726
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,220
 no matter how much Greek and Hebrew you might know,

727
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,860
 completely useless unless you change

728
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,100
 some things in your life.

729
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,460
 There's some stuff in your heart, Andrew,

730
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,060
 that you need to deal with.

731
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,220
 And if those things don't get dealt with,

732
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,500
 I will block your ears and you won't hear my word."

733
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,380
 And this led me on a difficult six-month journey

734
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,220
 of dealing with some really important things

735
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,180
 in my soul and my heart that needed to be dealt with,

736
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,260
 things like pride,

737
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,180
 things like arrogance in my cool in life,

738
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,220
 things like thinking I'm better

739
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,020
 because I'm in Bible school than in the marketplace,

740
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,820
 things that were ugly in me,

741
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,220
 other things that I don't want to tell you about.

742
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,540
 And I went through a six-month journey

743
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,940
 of having to bring those things to the Lord

744
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,780
 and have Him deal with me in

745
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,220
 so that I could even think about being

746
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,620
 in the place that I'm in right now

747
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,860
 and doing what I'm doing with you right now.

748
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,940
 And every single time that I prepare a sermon

749
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,340
 here at the Vine, God breathes over me and says,

750
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,820
 "Don't forget Amos 8."

751
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:56,260
 This has been a disruptive word for me

752
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,500
 that has messed me up inside for years and years and years.

753
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,860
 And by God's grace has enabled me

754
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,020
 to hopefully stand in front of you

755
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,060
 and say some things at times that are helpful to you.

756
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:16,340
 Mary, Mary had this future ahead of her that God could see.

757
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,180
 And so he came in the gentleness of this amazing man, Simeon,

758
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,060
 and said some things to her that were not easy to hear,

759
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,220
 some things that messed some things up inside of her.

760
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,540
 God could see what my future was

761
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,780
 as a young 30-year-old wondering what was going on in life.

762
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,100
 He could see what was gonna happen for me.

763
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,140
 And he said, "You will be a disaster

764
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,420
 "for those people in Hong Kong

765
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,180
 "unless you first deal with this."

766
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,180
 He so loved me and you that he was willing to disrupt

767
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,660
 and make a mess of some things in my life.

768
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,900
 And what you need to understand

769
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,540
 is that God doesn't just come into mess.

770
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,500
 Sometimes He creates mess.

771
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,340
 And He creates a mess sometimes by bringing a word

772
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,140
 that is designed to disrupt some faulty old ways

773
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,740
 of thinking in you so that you would be brought

774
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,540
 into new and transformative ways of being.

775
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,900
 That's actually the Christmas story,

776
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,500
 that Jesus was willing to disrupt this world,

777
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,780
 willing in the incarnation to come and stir some things up

778
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,420
 so that the world would get a vision of a life

779
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,300
 that is so much greater and so much better

780
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,900
 than the one that was currently being experienced.

781
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,660
 The point of Christmas, the point that Jesus has come

782
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,820
 is so that the world would know

783
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,340
 that there is an alternative way and is the Savior,

784
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,900
 one that can set us free, one that forgives sins,

785
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,300
 one that changes us.

786
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,980
 And we need Jesus to come in to our perfect little worlds

787
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,900
 and mess some things up sometimes

788
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,220
 so that we would come into a place

789
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,220
 where we would truly worship Him.

790
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:06,020
 My heart for you is that you would think about it this way,

791
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,980
 and this is perhaps the more positive way to think about it.

792
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,660
 If you really want to grow as a person in 2024,

793
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,820
 the greatest Christmas gift you can give yourself

794
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,100
 is an open and receptive heart to the correction

795
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,900
 and discipline of God in your life.

796
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,740
 And I know that's not the Christmas Eve message

797
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,900
 you were hoping to hear,

798
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,580
 but I do believe it's the Christmas Eve message

799
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,940
 that God wants you to hear.

800
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,220
 If you took that seriously in 2024,

801
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,580
 you will have your greatest maturing growth

802
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,180
 that you have ever experienced.

803
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,540
 And it's not that God is gonna say those kinds of things

804
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
 all the time to us.

805
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,260
 Of course, God so often and normally and usually speaks

806
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,260
 words of life and hope, but let's not close our hearts off

807
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,140
 to the truly transformative moments

808
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,540
 where He puts His little finger on something

809
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,620
 and says, "Let's go on a journey here for a little while,

810
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,100
 "and let's actually allow this thing to get healed

811
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,820
 "and renewed and redeemed for you."

812
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,100
 My prayer for us as a church as we head into the new year

813
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,180
 is that we would have a heart like Samuel

814
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,420
 in the Old Testament who walked into the presence of God

815
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,420
 and said this, "Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening."

816
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,780
 Tomorrow, we're going to give you a really positive,

817
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,420
 happy message on Christmas Day.

818
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,060
 Today, my prayer is that you listened.

819
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,540
 Should we pray?

820
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,940
 Let's pray.

821
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,660
 Father, I am so grateful for all these amazing people

822
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,620
 in this room and the overflow around the building right now.

823
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,380
 Father, I'm thankful that they are so hungry

824
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,580
 to come to worship you on Christmas Eve,

825
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,740
 that they're willing to stand, sit in the aisles,

826
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,620
 sit on the stairs.

827
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,460
 Lord, we honour everybody in this room.

828
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,860
 We're so grateful for the community

829
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,620
 that you've built here at the Vine.

830
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,940
 And Father, we thank you for Christmas

831
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,780
 and the real Christmas story,

832
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,260
 the original one 2,000 years ago.

833
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,340
 We thank you that Luke included a story like this,

834
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,780
 a story that perhaps is different

835
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,060
 from some of the other things we see in the Christmas story,

836
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:24,580
 a story where Mary sits under a challenging prophetic word

837
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,420
 from God.

838
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:30,340
 And Father, you speak so often words of life,

839
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,060
 the hope and truth.

840
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,220
 And sometimes you speak those words in ways

841
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,980
 that is designed to mess up our perfect worlds,

842
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,420
 particularly when we're misaligned to your will.

843
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,180
 (coughing)

844
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,300
 Father, I pray.

845
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,140
 I pray by your Holy Spirit

846
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,740
 that people here would know the love of God

847
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,140
 seen in the beauty and the wonder of a child

848
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,500
 born in Bethlehem.

849
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,940
 That people in this room would know the call that's upon them

850
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,620
 that through relationship with Jesus,

851
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,300
 they can experience the greatest flourishing

852
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,860
 that they will ever experience.

853
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,900
 And that everybody in this room would also know

854
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,460
 the openness of their hearts to whatever it is

855
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,940
 that God wants to say to them.

856
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,100
 Father, you know our best far better than we do.

857
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:34,140
 Father, we lay down our perceived perceptions and hopes

858
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,620
 and positive things that we want.

859
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,500
 Father, we ultimately want you.

860
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,700
 We want your leadership.

861
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,020
 We want your love.

862
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,380
 We wanna become the people that you need us to be

863
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,700
 so that the gospel could be heard in Hong Kong

864
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,340
 like it's never been heard before.

865
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,740
 I pray this Christmas Eve, Lord,

866
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,940
 would be a turning point for some of us here.

867
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,580
 And as we go into the new year,

868
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,220
 we would go in with open and receptive hearts.

869
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,300
 And that maybe there's some words

870
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,700
 that you've been saying to us this year

871
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,860
 that we've gently put to one side.

872
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,540
 Perhaps we've been like, I don't wanna deal with that.

873
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,900
 And maybe as we've unpacked this story today,

874
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,100
 the Holy Spirit has reminded you right now

875
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,580
 of some of those words that God has said to you in the past

876
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,620
 that you've either ignored or put to one side.

877
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,940
 And perhaps your Christmas gift this year

878
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,900
 is God just gently saying,

879
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,820
 I wanna bring you back to that word.

880
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,580
 I wanna bring you back to that thing.

881
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,980
 Let's talk about it.

882
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,620
 I wanna heal you and restore you and redeem you.

883
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,300
 The years that the locust have eaten from you,

884
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,380
 as Joel chapter two would say,

885
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,140
 I wanna restore to you, the Lord says.

886
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,020
 Let me speak.

887
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,900
 Father, I pray that you would speak,

888
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,620
 that Lord, your church would hear,

889
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,460
 and that Lord, together, we would glorify you

890
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,300
 just like those shepherds who left behind the sheep

891
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,540
 and saw the child Jesus in the manger

892
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,820
 and went back glorifying and sharing the news of you.

893
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,540
 Lord, I pray that that would be your church.

894
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,620
 At Christmas time.

895
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,740
 And Father, we thank you for this.

896
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,780
 In Jesus' name.

897
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,700
 Everyone says,

898
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,820
 Amen, amen.

899
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,660
 God bless.

900
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,100
 Would you stand with me and we're gonna worship together.

901
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
 And then after that,

902
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,940
 Kyla will come in just a bit and close our service.

903
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,540
 (gentle music)

904
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,540
