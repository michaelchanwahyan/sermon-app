1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I'm not enough unless you come.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,760
 Lord we just declare before you as a church this morning that we are not enough.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,520
 That our voices are not enough.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,880
 Our vision is not enough.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,280
 Our strategies are not enough.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,360
 Our music is not enough.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,080
 Our preaching is not enough.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,800
 We need you.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,320
 We are nothing, nothing without you.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,320
 And Lord we confess dry bones.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,200
 I wonder if you just take a moment where you're at just before the Lord.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,160
 If you're feeling dry, there's an area of weariness.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,820
 There's just something that's maybe going on in your relationship, in your life.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,040
 Maybe in your workplace, a sphere of influence you have.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,960
 And you know that you're in need of the power of the Spirit of God.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,880
 The power of the Spirit of God.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,480
 I wonder whether you'd just bring dry places to Him.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,080
 Father, we stand together as a community of faith on behalf of the brothers and sisters

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
 in this room.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,120
 Lord, I want to speak out over marriages that are broken in the name of Jesus.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,480
 Where there's dryness between spouses in this place.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,280
 Lord, would you bring your Holy Spirit, because we are nothing without you.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,920
 Lord, we pray for areas in our lives that feel broken at this time.

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,360
 Maybe struggling with some sickness, or maybe it's fear, anxiety in our hearts.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,760
 Lord, we bring it to you.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,680
 We say that in our own strength, all our strategies are not enough.

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,040
 Lord, we need you.

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,360
 Would you awaken dry bones, Lord?

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,160
 In our workplaces, where people are crying out for hope in this time and in this hour

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
 in Hong Kong.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,400
 Lord, would you open our mouths?

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
 Would you open our lives?

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,240
 Would we say something, Lord, of the hope that is found?

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,560
 Lord, take the dry bones in us, Lord.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,560
 And Father, we declare this over the church in this city.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,320
 You know, there are some aspects of church and in church history where they would say,

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,680
 "Man, that outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2, that was just for those people.

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,040
 Or that was just to get the church going.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,520
 That was just to bring the fire for the first missionaries."

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,880
 And God doesn't move like that.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,120
 And I stand where I stand in my city today.

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,160
 And I see all the needs that we have.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,120
 I see the giants that are around us.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
 I see the things that are taking place in our world right now.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,600
 I see the rise of violence between different nations.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,160
 I see nationalism, totalitarian leadership.

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,280
 I see racism like it's never been seen before.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,320
 And we stand on Pentecost Sunday and we say it's not just for those people in the first

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
 century.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,080
 We have our dry bones today, Holy Spirit.

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,220
 And we ask, Lord, that you would pour out on every single church in our city, Lord.

52
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,840
 You would pour out today on the people who are hungry and in need, Lord.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,640
 You would pour out today, Lord, on the injustices around us, Holy Spirit.

54
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:23,440
 Lord, in our time, in our hour, Lord, we need you.

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,680
 Lord, we are not going to do this in our own strength.

56
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,920
 And so, Father, we thank you.

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,160
 We thank you that your Spirit is the only thing that makes us different.

58
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,640
 Your death and resurrection is the only thing that makes us different.

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,360
 Lord, we want to hold forth resurrection life.

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,000
 Lord, we need it in our own lives.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
 Father, we thank you for that gift.

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,200
 Lord, as we open your word, oh, Father, as we come to your word today, we do not come

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,880
 at a distance.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,560
 We do not come wanting our ears to be tickled.

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,720
 But we come opening your scripture, believing that your word has power, that your word has

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,280
 something to say to this moment, to this city, that, Lord, your word has something to say

67
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,640
 to my life and my marriage and my workplace and my relationships.

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,920
 And so, Lord, we open your word with our hearts saying, "What is there for me today?

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,100
 How, Lord, do you want to uproot, tear down, destroy, overthrow, plant and build in me

70
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,280
 today, Lord?"

71
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,480
 And so, Father, we come hungry to be changed.

72
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:52,960
 We ask that you would move by your Spirit, that you would sit on us, convict us, heal

73
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,600
 us, restore us.

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,520
 Everyone says, "Amen."

76
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
 Amen.

77
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,560
 Let me thank our worship team just every week, serving so much.

78
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,840
 Have a seat, have a seat.

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
 Welcome to the Vine.

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,400
 If you're new online, welcome to you guys.

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 It's great to have you with us.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,200
 If you're new in this room as well, we are so glad you are here.

83
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,320
 You know, the Holy Spirit moves in a lot of different ways.

84
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,280
 One of the ways the Scriptures speak about the Spirit of God is that it comes to bring

85
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,640
 conviction.

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,760
 And as I was preparing this message today and as I was in this worship time, I know

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:56,520
 that I can't start my message this morning without confessing something to you.

88
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,120
 In 2019, I did not like God very much.

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,920
 If you've been here at the Vine for a season, for a time, you may know the story about me

90
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,640
 and my family in 2019.

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,720
 In March of 2019, my father passed away all of a sudden, very suddenly, within two weeks,

92
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,440
 through a very quick and painful battle with liver cancer.

93
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,680
 And that whole experience completely shook my world and turned me upside down.

94
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,720
 And I was wrestling with the reality that I was so angry at God for taking my father

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,560
 from me so quickly.

96
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
 And I was feeling so much bitterness.

97
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,840
 I was sitting in that tension between not being able to reconcile the suffering that

98
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,040
 I was experiencing in my life and the idea of a good and loving God.

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,760
 I wonder if anyone else in this room has ever felt that way.

100
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,040
 Where because of stuff that's happening in our lives, we can't reconcile what we've always

101
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,560
 believed, what we've always thought, what we've always known about God.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
 And I couldn't bring these two things together.

103
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,600
 And I was a senior pastor of a church.

104
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,480
 And I realized that actually I was very much like the older son in the parable of the prodigal

105
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
 son.

106
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,520
 And in those weeks and months just after my father passed, I was angry at God and I was

107
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,640
 saying, "God, why is it?

108
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,920
 Why is it that I slave away for you?

109
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,400
 I built a church for you.

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,480
 This church has not been easy to create, to build, to pastor, to lead.

111
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,320
 I have sacrificed many hours.

112
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,600
 I've sacrificed personal relationships for this thing and you take my father from me.

113
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,480
 Couldn't you throw me some blessings, God?

114
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,720
 I think I deserve a little bit more from you, God."

115
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,280
 And I was finding myself not being able to reconcile this reality.

116
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:02,920
 And then I was coming to church on Sundays and I felt like a fraud before you.

117
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:10,360
 Because I was preaching messages and I was leading services and I didn't have inside

118
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,400
 of me a healthy relationship with God.

119
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:25,920
 And I know that by God's grace, He can bless that, but I know that it was wrong.

120
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,920
 And here was the greatest fear I was carrying.

121
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,280
 The greatest fear was not that I would suck or that the church would go backwards and

122
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,920
 disintegrate.

123
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:43,200
 My greatest fear was that no one would actually know, that I could actually get away with

124
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:51,920
 it, that I could act spiritual without actually being spiritual.

125
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,640
 My greatest fear was that I would be able to get up in front of you on a Sunday and

126
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,520
 go through the motions of being a Christian when I knew in my heart that I was very far

127
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,320
 from where I had been with Jesus.

128
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,260
 And I knew that that was a dangerous place to be.

129
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,500
 And yet in that season of my life, I did that weekend after weekend after weekend and it

130
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,920
 wasn't right.

131
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,940
 And that wasn't the worst of it.

132
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,740
 Here was the worst of it.

133
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:33,640
 The worst of it was I convinced myself that the way to get my relationship back with God

134
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:41,020
 was by just trying to push into this doing thing, trying to push into just the activities

135
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,280
 of my faith, trying to kind of be a pastor, be that better person, preach the best message,

136
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,140
 go to that event, do all this stuff, give more money to the church.

137
00:09:49,140 --> 00:10:00,180
 I tried to in my activity, find a way to restore what was actually broken in my relationship.

138
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,660
 I looked to the activity of my Christianity to be my salvation and completely left God,

139
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,560
 my Savior, out of it.

140
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,820
 Are you with me?

141
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,780
 I thought that if I could just act like a Christian more, that if I could say the right

142
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,180
 things, raise my hands right, sing the right words, say the right prayers, that in somehow

143
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,380
 that might cover for the reality that I'm not willing and I'm not yet able to come before

144
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:36,460
 God and say, "This is broken and I'm upset with you and I need to humble myself and come

145
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,260
 before you afresh."

146
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:47,500
 It wasn't right and I can't preach the message that I want to preach today without coming

147
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,020
 before you first and asking for you to forgive me.

148
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,620
 I look back on those times and by God's grace, He moved the church forward and people were

149
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,780
 saved, but that's not the point.

150
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,580
 The point is I led you falsely and that's not right.

151
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,820
 So I want to confess that to you.

152
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,380
 I want to ask that you would forgive me.

153
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,460
 I want to ask my elders, I've got some elders here in this service, if they would forgive

154
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,460
 me.

155
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,700
 I didn't tell anyone about it.

156
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,140
 I just did it.

157
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,660
 I put on the front of being a Christian and I didn't have the relationship with Jesus.

158
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,860
 So I hope that you would forgive me.

159
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,740
 What I want to say to us today I think is a significant word for our church, but also

160
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,760
 for this city right now.

161
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,020
 Because I want to speak into the reality that so often I think this is our greatest danger,

162
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,420
 that we over-emphasize the doing for Jesus and we forget about the being with Jesus.

163
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:57,500
 And that when we do that, we put ourselves in a position to become powerless.

164
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,400
 Here's the thing I'm sensing in my spirit.

165
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,100
 That in the time of Hong Kong's history where God wants the church in this city to rise

166
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,140
 up in its authority and its power and to bring the hope of the gospel to a broken city that

167
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,460
 is in search of its identity, in that very season, the enemy is releasing the greatest

168
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:29,060
 strategy that he has to try to rip and steal the power and the authority out of the church.

169
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,220
 And I want to open up for you what I think that strategy is, and I want to call it out

170
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,820
 of me and I want to call it out of you.

171
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,260
 And I don't pretend to think that my sin is your sin.

172
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,580
 But what I do know is this, that because of what I went through in 2019 and the process

173
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,620
 that God has taken me through in my life, I can stand before you today and say we have

174
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,740
 to watch out.

175
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,860
 We have to be careful that we as the Hong Kong church doesn't get so consumed in the

176
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,260
 activity for God that we completely release ourselves from any true lasting relationship

177
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
 with God.

178
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:17,020
 And if we do that, we are powerless in the very time when God needs the church the most.

179
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:24,820
 I want to stand before you today and say this will not happen on our watch.

180
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,180
 But it did happen on Moses' watch.

181
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:35,180
 And we're continuing our series in a different spirit and we're looking at numbers 13 and

182
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,100
 14 and in this passage of scripture, there's so much in there throughout this whole story.

183
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,100
 There's so much that has been there.

184
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,340
 We've seen all this amazing stuff, but there's this passage right at the end, this passage

185
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,780
 that doesn't get read very often.

186
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,380
 In fact, on my Bible, it's over the next page.

187
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,260
 And when you know when it's on the next page, you very rarely get there.

188
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,540
 And we've seen all of numbers 13 and 14, the giants and the grapes, all the great stuff

189
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,620
 that's happened.

190
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,540
 We've seen all of the stuff that's taken place and how Moses has had to come and call them

191
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,100
 to account for their sin.

192
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,220
 We've seen God forgive them.

193
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,700
 We've seen them get restored and yet see consequences of their sin.

194
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,540
 We've seen the whole heartedness that promise talked about last week.

195
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,620
 All of that is there.

196
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,940
 And then we think that's the end of the story and everything's good.

197
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,180
 And then this happens.

198
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,380
 It's like the epilogue to the story, the thing that isn't preached on very often, but the

199
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,180
 thing that I think the whole story is actually about.

200
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,540
 Let me read this to us.

201
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,380
 Numbers 14, verse 36.

202
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,620
 So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community

203
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,980
 grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it.

204
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,940
 These men responsible for spreading that bad report about the land were struck down and

205
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,300
 died of a plague before the Lord.

206
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,740
 Of the men who went up to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh

207
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,460
 survived.

208
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:04,020
 When Moses reported this all to the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.

209
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,340
 Early the next morning, they went up towards the high hill country.

210
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,460
 We have sinned, they said.

211
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,640
 We will go up to the place that the Lord has promised.

212
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,440
 But Moses said, why are you disobeying the Lord's command?

213
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,100
 This will not succeed.

214
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,180
 Do not go up because the Lord is not with you.

215
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,560
 You will be defeated by your enemies.

216
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,340
 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there.

217
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,780
 And because you have turned away from the Lord, he will not be with you and you will

218
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,220
 fall by the sword.

219
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,700
 Nevertheless, in their presumption, they went up towards the high hill country.

220
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,380
 Though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord's covenant moved from the camp.

221
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,500
 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who had lived in that hill country came down and

222
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,820
 attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormat.

223
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,140
 This is the end of the story.

224
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,340
 It's the end of the whole thing with the promised land and the spies and everything.

225
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,680
 And we get right to the end of it.

226
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,660
 And Israel has learned nothing.

227
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,020
 I mean, here's Israel.

228
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,660
 And they've seen all the things that have unfolded.

229
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,120
 They've heard through Moses, God calling out their sin.

230
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,820
 And now they've literally witnessed the 10 spies, the men who had gone into that promised

231
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,580
 land and come back with a bad report.

232
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,260
 They've literally watched them be killed with plagues in front of them.

233
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,780
 And no wonder this creates a bitterness in the camp, a mourning, a kind of sense of fear

234
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,780
 amongst them.

235
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,100
 And I want you to see what they do out of their fear in verse 40.

236
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,540
 "Earlier the next morning, they went up to the high hill country."

237
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
 That's the promised land.

238
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,180
 "We have sinned," they said.

239
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,060
 And because we have sinned, we will go to the place that the Lord promised.

240
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,060
 I want you to see what Israel's doing here.

241
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,860
 They've not learned anything.

242
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,820
 They've realized that they've sinned, that they've done wrong in the Lord's eyes.

243
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,900
 And they think, like I did in 2019, that the way to repair their relationship with God

244
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,580
 is to go into the promised land.

245
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,100
 That was the thing that got us into trouble to begin with, that we didn't think it was

246
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,780
 right for us to go into the promised land.

247
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,740
 We know that the promised land is God's will.

248
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,460
 And we've sinned.

249
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,020
 And without even thinking, without even checking their hearts, without even wondering where

250
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,980
 their relationship with God is, they just think if they do the activities of God, then

251
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,460
 that's going to somehow create a favor in them that God will bless them and they'll

252
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,220
 be able to restore the very thing that is broken.

253
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,380
 I want you to see what they're doing here.

254
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:49,780
 They're actually trying to repair their broken hearts through doing God's will without relationship

255
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,180
 with God.

256
00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:00,140
 They think that their right actions will repair their wrong hearts.

257
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,040
 They think that their strength is what will do it, when actually it will only ever happen

258
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,740
 through their humility.

259
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,960
 Come on, church.

260
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,340
 They think that if they could just get into that promised land, if they could just physically

261
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,340
 do the stuff that God wants, then everything's going to be okay.

262
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,020
 And they've completely lost the plot because they thought that their sin was that they

263
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,860
 didn't act in the promised land.

264
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,340
 And so they think that the way to repair that sin is by acting in the promised land.

265
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,980
 And I want you to see how Moses responds to this kind of thinking.

266
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,540
 He goes, "Why are you still disobeying the Lord's command?"

267
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,540
 Verse 41.

268
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,060
 "This will not succeed.

269
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,540
 Don't go up because the Lord is not with you.

270
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,740
 You will be defeated by your enemies."

271
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,940
 There it is.

272
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
 This is not going to work.

273
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,140
 You're going to get defeated.

274
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
 This is the wrong way to go about it.

275
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
 Why?

276
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
 Right at the beginning of verse 42.

277
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,940
 "Do not go up because the Lord is not with you.

278
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,580
 Your relationship with Him is not being repaired.

279
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,300
 You are not on the same page.

280
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,660
 He's not with you.

281
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,980
 You are not with Him."

282
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,580
 And you're thinking that your action is going to repair something that actually can only

283
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:23,660
 be repaired through your humility, through you actually confessing what is truly wrong,

284
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,460
 that you've given up on your relationship with God, and instead you've become consumed

285
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,260
 by the doing of God.

286
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,260
 Is anybody here?

287
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
 Hmm.

288
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,540
 This is a great challenge.

289
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,580
 The Israelites' faulty thinking is this.

290
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,860
 They think it's that the activity will create the relationship, when it's actually the relationship

291
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,300
 that creates the activity.

292
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,380
 Are you with me?

293
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,500
 They think that if they could just do, act, and sing, if they could just go to more services,

294
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,740
 raise their hands and sing the right songs, if they just had found the right prayers to

295
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,580
 pray, surely God will forgive them and begin to love them again.

296
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,020
 And Moses is saying, "No, no.

297
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,580
 Your thinking is wrong because God's not with you, and if He's not with you, no amount of

298
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,380
 activity is going to work.

299
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:19,220
 You got to humble yourself and come back to Him.

300
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,500
 You got to be more than you're going to do."

301
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,720
 Here's the warning for us, and here's the thing that I got wrong in 2019.

302
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,580
 We have to be really careful that our activities for God doesn't outweigh our relationship

303
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,580
 with God.

304
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,180
 Are you with me?

305
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,260
 We got to be really careful.

306
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,540
 Now, listen to me.

307
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,620
 I'm not saying that activity is wrong in and of itself.

308
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,780
 I'm not saying that activity never helps.

309
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,540
 We all know that we deepen and create and grow our relationship through really good

310
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
 spiritual disciplines.

311
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,740
 There are activities in God, of course, but we got to make sure that the balance of the

312
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,200
 scales that our activities for God doesn't outweigh our relationship with God.

313
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,220
 When that happens, here's what will take place in your life.

314
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,540
 You will end up doing God's will, but your way.

315
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,820
 Come on.

316
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,220
 You'll end up doing God's will, but your way.

317
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,620
 That's exactly what Israel do.

318
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,580
 Going into the promised land was God's will.

319
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,780
 Taking that land was God's will.

320
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,860
 Finding a place of milk and honey, a place of flourishing and growth was all on the heart

321
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
 of God.

322
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,900
 But Israel are still in their self-centered rebellion in front of God, because they want

323
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,660
 to do the will of God their way.

324
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:45,940
 See, it's bad enough if you want to do your will your way, but it's just as dangerous

325
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,820
 for you to do God's will your way.

326
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,340
 It's got to be God's will, God's way.

327
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,200
 They got the timing completely wrong.

328
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,220
 They had the right idea, the wrong timing.

329
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,900
 They had the right action, the wrong motive.

330
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,180
 And they would have known that if they had been connected in relationship with God, if

331
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,940
 they had been building that heart, the whole heartedness that promise spoke about last

332
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
 week.

333
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:20,020
 If that was at work in them, then they wouldn't have made this mistake, but it wasn't.

334
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,980
 When we find ourselves doing this, here's what takes place.

335
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,820
 We think we can get the blessings and the promises of God simply by just doing rather

336
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,820
 than being.

337
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,940
 I want you to understand this, that we are never going to get the blessings of God that

338
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,940
 way.

339
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:46,940
 That actually it's more like this, that every single time we try to do God's will our way,

340
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,960
 we cannot hope to reap the same blessings.

341
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,180
 You can't expect to move into the promised land in your timing, in your agenda, in your

342
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,660
 ways, even if the promised land is what God's got.

343
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:05,580
 And so Moses stands back and he says, "If you go in there without God being with you,

344
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,820
 you will be defeated.

345
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,700
 It will not work out for you."

346
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,460
 And so we stand in this moment right here in Hong Kong's history, and I think this is

347
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,180
 a great challenge for the church in our city.

348
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,060
 We've been saying in this series, haven't we, that this is an important hour for us

349
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
 to be in.

350
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,420
 We've been saying in this series that Hong Kong is God's promised land, that this is

351
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,220
 a place that flows with milk and honey, that there are hundreds and thousands and millions

352
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,260
 of people that need to know Jesus in this place, that we're in a critical time of Hong

353
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,980
 Kong's history where it's asking about its identity.

354
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,340
 It wants to know more about who it is.

355
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,860
 It's struggling with the realities of giants and graves, and we've got the answer.

356
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,500
 And we've been saying in this series that we must get this different spirit in us like

357
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:54,540
 Caleb and Joshua to be able to stand up in this time and in this hour, and we believe,

358
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:00,180
 just like Moses says over the people, the land is still exceedingly good.

359
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,180
 Amen?

360
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:09,300
 The danger will be that we will try to accomplish in Hong Kong God's will our way, that we'll

361
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,980
 try to bring it about in our own strength, that we'll listen to a series like this and

362
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,820
 get so pumped up and say, "Yeah, I'm going to go and change the world for Jesus," and

363
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,660
 we leave Jesus behind.

364
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:29,060
 And we get ahead of Him, thinking that as long as I act and be and do like Him, that

365
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:35,700
 everything's going to be okay, and God stands over here, and He's like, "I'm waiting.

366
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:42,820
 Waiting for you to be with Me, because that's what I want, but we need to do it together."

367
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,060
 Here's what the enemy's going to do.

368
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,860
 The enemy is designed to do this.

369
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,860
 This is a strategy over you.

370
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,340
 He wants to cause you to put the doing over the being.

371
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:02,180
 The enemy wants to turn your Christianity into a sociology.

372
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:09,340
 He wants you to actually embrace Christian ideas, Christian morals, Christian ethics.

373
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:16,460
 He would love you to live like a Christian, devoid of your relationship with Jesus.

374
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,980
 He would want for you to actually think that you are a Christian and not actually engage

375
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,820
 in the reality of a relationship with God.

376
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:30,860
 If the enemy can push the church into activity after activity and away from relationship,

377
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,300
 the enemy will create a powerless church.

378
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,460
 Let me put it this way.

379
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:47,340
 The enemy wants to take Christ out of Christianity and create what I like to call secular believers,

380
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,860
 those who claim the name of Jesus but are without the authority that comes from a relationship

381
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,340
 with Jesus.

382
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,100
 That's what the Church of Hong Kong needs to be aware of, that we would claim to be

383
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:05,820
 people of Jesus, but we don't have the authority that comes from a relationship with Jesus.

384
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:12,020
 In 2019, I claimed to be your senior pastor, but I did not have the authority in me that

385
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,100
 comes from a relationship with Jesus, and I have to repent of that.

386
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,020
 And I wonder, that was me in 2019.

387
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,780
 I wonder what's going on for you in 2021.

388
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:28,340
 I wonder whether you've made it a habit of embracing Christian ideals and Christian ethics

389
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,660
 and all of these things.

390
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,980
 I wonder if you're trying to live in obedience to Scripture and you're trying to be that

391
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:40,020
 way without actually having an ongoing, deepening, intimate relationship with Jesus.

392
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,420
 Let me tell you, it is possible.

393
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,260
 And the enemy will cover our eyes from seeing that reality, and that's why I feel like this

394
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,380
 message is important.

395
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:59,380
 There is no authority in activity alone.

396
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,940
 Come on, church.

397
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,340
 There's no authority in activity alone.

398
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,060
 Where does the authority come from?

399
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,220
 Let's have a look at what Moses says.

400
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
 Verse 44.

401
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
 Is this helping anyone?

402
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
 Anyone awake still?

403
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
 You okay?

404
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,220
 Upper house?

405
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
 Online?

406
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:19,980
 I see you checking Instagram right now.

407
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:29,260
 Put that down in the name of Jesus.

408
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
 Verse 44.

409
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,140
 "Nevertheless, in their presumption, they went up towards the high hill country, though

410
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,580
 neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord's covenant moved from the camp."

411
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,580
 I want you to notice this.

412
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,420
 The author is saying, "Here's how it all went wrong.

413
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,700
 They went ahead to do the things of God, but they left God behind.

414
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,260
 But Moses and the ark of the covenant never moved from the camp."

415
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,420
 You need to realize that this represents the authority of God amongst Israel.

416
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,180
 If you look at the Exodus narrative in the wilderness, that ark of the covenant where

417
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:05,140
 the tablets were found, created as it was, the tent of tabernacle, the tent of meeting,

418
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,780
 created as it was, was a physical sign to the people that the presence of God was with

419
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
 them.

420
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,220
 The pillar of fire, the cloud at night, it was a way for them to know God's presence

421
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,340
 is with them.

422
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,260
 And not just His presence, but in Moses and Aaron, they had the mouthpiece of God amongst

423
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
 them.

424
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,620
 That Moses and Aaron would hear from the heart of God and translate and bring that to Israel.

425
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,340
 So both in the presence represented by the ark and in the word represented by Moses and

426
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,860
 Aaron, you have the authority of God.

427
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,100
 Are you with me?

428
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,180
 So Israel's authority was not in their armies.

429
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,140
 It was not in their strength.

430
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,120
 It was not in their great strategy to take the promised land.

431
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,220
 It was only in the authority that comes through the presence of God.

432
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,900
 Will you be with us?

433
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,300
 If only you are with us, will we succeed in the promised land?

434
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,500
 We could do all that we want in our own strength to be in the promised land, even though it

435
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,140
 might be your will, but if you're not with us, we will be defeated.

436
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,220
 And so it is for us in our city right now.

437
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,580
 It's really important we understand this.

438
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,100
 Our authority as the church in Hong Kong will not come in the years ahead because we are

439
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,300
 the right ones.

440
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,700
 It will not come because we have better morals than everyone else.

441
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,620
 It won't come because we have a certain political persuasion.

442
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,620
 It will not come because we're great peacemakers and reconcilers.

443
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,180
 It's not even going to come because we have great church services, as important as all

444
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,500
 that is.

445
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,820
 It only comes through Christ and Christ aligned.

446
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,480
 That's where our authority is.

447
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,440
 Those with a different spirit are people that don't do God's will their way.

448
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,920
 They are people that don't pretend to be Christians.

449
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,580
 Let me say this, there is no power in acting like a Christian.

450
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,520
 Come on church, some of you need to hear that today.

451
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,360
 There's no power in just living under Christian ethics and morals.

452
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:11,940
 A different spirit says, "The most important thing to me is knowing Jesus."

453
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,080
 And yes, there are activities that are involved in that and those are good.

454
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,120
 But my relationship with Jesus is paramount.

455
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,720
 I will not move forward unless it's God's will and God's way.

456
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,520
 And to understand His will and His way, the only way I come to understand that for me,

457
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,080
 for my marriage, for my workplace, for the gifts God's given me, for my church at the

458
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:41,040
 Vine, for my city in Hong Kong, the only way I know that is if I'm in relationship with

459
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
 Him.

460
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,280
 And so I'm calling us in this message back to relationship with Jesus, particularly for

461
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,680
 those of us in this room that know that you've drifted.

462
00:30:52,680 --> 00:31:03,880
 And some of us in this room, like me in 2019, are pretending and that is stripping the church

463
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,600
 of its authority.

464
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,740
 That's a hard word.

465
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,560
 And I can say that because I've lived it.

466
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,900
 How did I heal?

467
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,900
 How can you heal?

468
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,120
 Two minutes, are you ready?

469
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,280
 Doesn't happen in two minutes, but I'm going to share it in two minutes.

470
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,880
 I went into my sabbatical in 2019.

471
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,440
 I actually had a sabbatical before I knew my father was sick and my father passed away.

472
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,880
 We already had a sabbatical for me.

473
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,320
 I'd been working here for 10 years.

474
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,480
 It was a gift, four months off.

475
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,760
 It's interesting, isn't it, that what I needed, I was, remember, I was trying to gain my relationship

476
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,440
 back with God by entering into the promised land in my way, right?

477
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,200
 Thinking that activity would replace relationship.

478
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 God gives me a sabbatical.

479
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,240
 The very definition of sabbatical is no activity.

480
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,080
 God knows what I needed.

481
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,840
 I was going to go into sabbatical and go to churches every Sunday that I did not know,

482
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,440
 sit in pews that I would never sit in again, completely anonymous from everybody in that

483
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,640
 room, and it was going to be glorious.

484
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,400
 Before I went on sabbatical, a mentor of mine took me aside.

485
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,480
 He says, "Andrew, do you know how the Bible ends?"

486
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,720
 I'm like, "Yes, I do.

487
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,320
 Let me prove to you."

488
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,360
 Revelations 21, 22, oh, the New Jerusalem.

489
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,080
 God brings this New Jerusalem down from the sky.

490
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
 It's like heaven comes to earth.

491
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,200
 There's only one river, only one tree, no longer good and evil, just healing for all

492
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
 the nations.

493
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,680
 It's wonderful, and everybody, even the trees clap their hands.

494
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
 My friend was like, "Hmm, okay."

495
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,680
 No, he wasn't like that.

496
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

497
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,760
 I know all that stuff, but do you know how actually the Bible ends?

498
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,360
 Do you know what the last words are in Scripture?"

499
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
 I thought about it for a second.

500
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
 I said, "Yeah, yeah, I do, actually.

501
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,480
 It's 'Maranatha, come Lord Jesus.'"

502
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,280
 My friend grabbed the Bible, and he's like, "Isn't that awesome?"

503
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,960
 The Bible itself is the story of the activities of God on earth.

504
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,320
 The Bible is God's heart for redemption.

505
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,880
 The Bible is all about what it is to get saved and see shalom take place in the world.

506
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,320
 You get all the way through all of this incredible activity.

507
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,400
 You get to the end of Revelations 21 and 22, and you see God complete all of the works

508
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,520
 that He has to do in everything in creation.

509
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:27,000
 And then, after everything else has ceased, there's still one thing left, relationship,

510
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,600
 being overdoing.

511
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,000
 That even after all of that incredible activity, we get to the end of the Bible, and the writer

512
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,240
 decides to say this to us, "There is always more of Jesus."

513
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,560
 And our posture is invitation.

514
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,240
 "Maranatha, come Lord Jesus."

515
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,440
 My friend, my mentor, put his hand on my shoulder, and he says, "Go into your sabbatical.

516
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,440
 Cease your activity.

517
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,200
 Maranatha."

518
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,000
 Some of you in this room, that's a word in season for you.

519
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,640
 The Holy Spirit, if this message is saying something to you today, if you recognize that

520
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,000
 you are at times pretending to be a Christian in the hopes that your relationship will catch

521
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,520
 up, if you realize that it's been some time now since you've actually had that deeper

522
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:28,200
 intimacy with Jesus, can I say to you, maybe can I put a metaphorical hand on your shoulder

523
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,600
 today, and simply say to you, "Maranatha, our healing comes from a place of both repentance

524
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,600
 and invitation, to repent and invite."

525
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,000
 Susanne talked about this a few weeks ago, repentance is actually life to us.

526
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,720
 It gives us and brings us into life.

527
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:52,240
 And some of us in this room, like I needed to in 2019, need to come before the Lord and

528
00:34:52,240 --> 00:35:00,480
 repent, to say this was not right, that what's going on in my life right now is not right,

529
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,160
 and I'm willing, Lord, to say so.

530
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,800
 I don't want to be like the Israelites that jump ahead of your timing and your will and

531
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
 your way.

532
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,040
 I want your will and your way for my life and for this city, and I recognize that I'm

533
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,520
 not in the right place, so would you come?

534
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,360
 And if you say sorry, don't just say sorry, but invite God to be with you again.

535
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,000
 Welcome Him.

536
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,800
 The Israelites had to wander for 40 years in the wilderness to get that process of repentance

537
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,640
 in their heart right before they could finally enter the promised land.

538
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,280
 I had four months where I would go on these hikes all the time, and I didn't know what

539
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
 to say to God.

540
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,440
 I didn't even really feel like talking to Him, but I could hear my mentor, and I would

541
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,840
 go on these walks, and I'd be like, "Maranatha, Maranatha, Maranatha, Maranatha."

542
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,240
 I didn't even say it in a positive way.

543
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,000
 I was like, "Maranatha, Maranatha."

544
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,620
 But yet in some faithfulness of saying, "Actually, I'm right here at the need of welcoming Jesus

545
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,160
 into my life again, I found my healing."

546
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,600
 You know what?

547
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,320
 I can stand here in 2021 proud to be leading this church.

548
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,680
 I can stand here in front of you not with a perfect relationship with Jesus, but with

549
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,560
 a Caleb spirit in me because of what I went through in 2019.

550
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,560
 I can stand before you and say, "I've got hope for this city," and really believe it.

551
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,960
 I can stand before you and say, "I'm not afraid of the giants," and really mean it.

552
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,000
 I can stand before you and say, "I'm going to say things in the pulpit and write things

553
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,600
 in the newspaper because I am courageous about the gospel."

554
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,520
 I can stand before you and say, "I believe that this is the church's hour to rise up

555
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
 in the city."

556
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
 Why?

557
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,960
 Because I know what it's like to try to do God's way my way.

558
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,420
 And I've had to face the reality of that, confess my sin, get healed by him, and find

559
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,360
 myself in a place of relationship again, and for you as well.

560
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:04,080
 Moses says to God during the Exodus, "If you don't go with us, how will anybody know that

561
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,620
 we're different?

562
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,940
 How is there any hope if your presence isn't with us?

563
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,540
 If you're not for us or with us, how will they know your love, your compassion, your

564
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,540
 kindness?

565
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,940
 It has to be your presence and your spirit.

566
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,420
 We refuse to go forward without you."

567
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:24,380
 I wonder whether a cry would rise up on the church in Hong Kong in this hour and say,

568
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,860
 "We will not go forward without you.

569
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,820
 Believe us when we are not with you.

570
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
 We come."

571
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
 Maranatha.

572
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
 Come, Lord Jesus.

573
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
 Can I pray for us?

574
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,820
 Let's pray.

575
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,820
 Maybe take a moment.

576
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:55,660
 If you're comfortable, I just invite you to open your hands before the Lord.

577
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,740
 If you know this message has been speaking to you, everybody's eyes is closed.

578
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:07,700
 But you know in this moment, the Holy Spirit has been speaking directly to you.

579
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,940
 It almost feels like my experience has been your experience.

580
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,300
 Maybe slightly different in your context, but you know what I'm saying resonates with

581
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
 you.

582
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:22,020
 As you open your hands before the Lord, it's a symbol before Him to say, "Maranatha.

583
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
 Come Lord Jesus."

584
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:30,020
 If you're in this room right now or you're watching online, and you know that your heart

585
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:37,180
 is not right, you know that you've been consumed in doing over being, you know that for a while

586
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:43,820
 you've just been kind of acting a Christian, going through the motions, trying to live

587
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:52,460
 the right morals, but there's no active, vibrant, intimate relationship with God.

588
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:58,180
 I believe the Holy Spirit has a special touch of His presence for you this morning.

589
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:06,780
 On this Pentecost Sunday, He's here for you.

590
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,460
 Moses cries out, "If only God is with us."

591
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,740
 And some of you in this room, you need to say that again.

592
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,460
 You haven't said it for a while.

593
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,460
 You've gotten ahead of God, you've gotten ahead of His timing, you're consumed with

594
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:32,820
 activity, even good activity, but it's actually shielding you from slowing down enough to

595
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,100
 rebirth your relationship with Jesus.

596
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,140
 And that's what today is about.

597
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,780
 And so those in this room that need that, I want to just invite you just to bring that

598
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,660
 before the Holy Spirit as He leads in your heart.

599
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,820
 We're going to create some space now just for that to take place.

600
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,300
 We've got a few minutes left in the service.

601
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,660
 Don't need to rush, just take a moment.

602
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,500
 It's quite rare in Hong Kong to have a time where things slow down a little bit.

603
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,020
 Take this time, take this moment to let the Holy Spirit search your heart, to encourage

604
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,540
 you, love you, bring His compassion to you.

605
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,180
 And as He shows you stuff to bring before Him, do that in faith and just say, "Maranatha,"

606
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,100
 to Him in your heart.

607
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:24,140
 I believe that the Lord is uncovering a strategy of the enemy over our lives, over our church

608
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,140
 today.

609
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:32,180
 The only way we break off that strategy is we turn to Jesus, individually and corporately

610
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,100
 together.

611
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,700
 So I invite you to take the time to do that now.

612
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,220
