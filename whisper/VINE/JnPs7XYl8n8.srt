1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 to be a community that stands in love on behalf of Branches of Hope.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,640
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name. Amen.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,400
 Amen. Amen. Thank you.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
 As I was listening to that testimony, I was like,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,240
 "Wow, he's just preached my whole word. We can go home."

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,440
 No, we won't.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,240
 It's such a privilege and an honor to have been on the board of directors

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,960
 for Branches of Hope for the last three and a half years.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,560
 And today, being given the privilege to talk about something I'm passionate about,

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,400
 the work we do at Branches of Hope,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,240
 and something I'm really passionate about, the work of compassion.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,040
 Such a privilege.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,360
 My husband is here at the 11.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,360
 And his name is KK. I think Andrew spoke about it.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
 So if you hear him screaming, "Amen," he's just here to encourage me. Amen.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,560
 So, yeah, I need all that encouragement.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,640
 Thank you, everyone.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
 So we're going to read from Matthew 22, 37 to 40.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
 So turn with me to Matthew 22, 37 to 40.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
 And Jesus replied, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart,

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
 all your soul, and all your mind.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,600
 This is the first and greatest commandment.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,000
 A second is equally important.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
 Love your neighbor as yourself."

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400
 So if you look at your neighbor, you're meant to love them,

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,160
 even if they're not your spouse.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,480
 So love your neighbor as you love yourself.

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,520
 The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,600
 That means this is a very important piece of Scripture that we're looking at today.

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,320
 Today is Branches of Hope Sunday,

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,120
 and it's no surprise that we're going to be speaking about love.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,600
 Because like mentioned before in the testimony,

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
 the people we are serving in Branches of Hope

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
 have experienced the very opposite of what we're talking about, this love.

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,280
 They have experienced a brutality, most of them, that we can't even think or imagine.

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,840
 What is worse is that they are far away from the loving families

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,840
 that could be helping them heal from the traumas that they've experienced.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,480
 But I believe this community, you and I, God has placed us in this community

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,120
 to be that love, to be that church of hope that wraps its arms around those who are in need.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,280
 This reminds me of a dream I had a few weeks ago.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,400
 And in this dream, I was shown a Scripture, but without the words.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
 So I knew this was a Scripture, and I sensed God was saying in the Scripture,

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,800
 "The first part you're doing really well, but the second part you're not doing well."

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
 So the whole day, and this never came up, you know, Matthew 22.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,520
 So the whole day I was thinking and agonizing,

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,640
 and I came to worship, usually God speaks to me in worship.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,680
 So I came to worship, I was agonizing, "God, you gotta tell me,

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
 because if you don't tell me, then I can't repent."

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,900
 Nothing.

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,840
 Then after that, the whole day I was really like, "God, you need to tell me," you know.

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,120
 And just before I went into a prayer meeting with some ladies, God began to reveal it.

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,360
 I think the suspense had to come for me to really weep for what God showed me.

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,120
 I then realized the second dream I'd had the same night was connected to the first.

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
 Because in the second dream, God had shown me someone who was in need.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,800
 God had shown me somebody who needed hospital fees.

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,880
 God had shown me the need of this person, but I had not called that person.

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,960
 I had not provided for that person, and I had certainly not prayed for that person.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,160
 God called me out and weeping, I told the people I was in the prayer meeting with,

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,000
 and we were all weeping and repenting, because every single one of them

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
 realized they had done the same.

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,800
 In the busyness of life, especially in Hong Kong,

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,160
 we can sometimes be so too busy to even look at the need around us.

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,040
 But I believe God has even created today, this Sunday, for us to pause a little bit

64
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,680
 and see the need around us.

65
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,720
 The last two weeks, Pastor Andrew has really been unpacking what justice is,

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,680
 and it's been amazing.

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,440
 I'm no theologian, but today I'm going to unpack as well

68
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,080
 what branches of hope needs, and we believe all of us need, and that is love.

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,800
 In the first week, Pastor Andrew spoke about four key relationships.

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,560
 Us with God, and it seems from the dream I was doing well with that.

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,800
 Us with ourselves, I'm not sure about that because it wasn't revealed.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,760
 But us with others, I wasn't doing so well there.

73
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,280
 And then us with creation.

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,160
 Today we're going to focus on us with others,

75
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
 and in particular with branches of hope.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,600
 Last week, Pastor Andrew mentioned that you cannot call yourself a Christian

77
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,040
 and remain distant to the injustice in the society around you.

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,400
 When the plight of the asylum seekers and refugees in our church

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,240
 became so glaring, we could not keep quiet.

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,760
 We had to step forward.

81
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,040
 We had to see.

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,640
 We had to weep and begin to speak about what people were experiencing in this church.

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:08,560
 And not only that, branches of hope and the ministry of Arise was birthed from this need.

84
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,960
 And year after year, the voice of branches of hope has become louder and louder and louder

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,880
 because of the love, the prayers, and the generosity of the people in this room.

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,880
 The love, prayer, and giving of you has changed many lives

87
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
 and given hope to those in a dire situation.

88
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,560
 We also learned last week that the local church, the body of Christ,

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,720
 is always called to walk towards the community and love it.

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,080
 But in order for us to know what this love is really about,

91
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,840
 we're going to unpack a little bit of the Greek word for love in Matthew 22, verse 37 to 40.

92
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,720
 There are actually four Greek words I want to speak about,

93
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
 and the last one is what we see in Matthew 22.

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,840
 So philia love, this is a brotherly love.

95
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,760
 This is an affectionate kind of love based on feelings and proximity.

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,120
 And then there's torch love, which is the family love.

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
 This is a bond created in being a family.

98
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,960
 When I look at Storge, nowadays I've got a teenage daughter,

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,320
 and she seems to be leaning more on philia than Storge, but that's okay.

100
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,040
 Then there's eros love.

101
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,960
 This is a love normally based on feelings and passion for each other.

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
 But today we want to focus on agape love.

103
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,120
 This is a sacrificial and unconditional love.

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,800
 While philia, Storge, and eros are basically primarily a love of emotion,

105
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
 agape is not primarily an act of feelings,

106
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,360
 though it can be involved, but a love of devotion and acts that flow from God.

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,880
 This kind of love in Matthew 22, verse 37 to 40 is agape.

108
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,160
 Today we're going to also look at some scriptures related to agape,

109
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
 because in the New Testament, agape is mentioned over 100 times.

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,000
 That means it's very important.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
 But today we want to look at some of those scriptures, not all 100,

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,040
 but some of those scriptures in order for us to see what the definition of agape really is.

113
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,000
 So turn with me to 1 John 3, verse 16 to 18.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,720
 We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us.

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,200
 So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters.

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,120
 If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need,

117
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,120
 but shows no compassion, how can God's love be in that person?

118
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,680
 Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other.

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
 Let us show the truth by our actions.

120
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
 This is a real scripture, everyone.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
 Maybe sometimes you're like me,

122
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,600
 and I sometimes skip through some of these scriptures and think,

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
 "Oh, I know what God wants me to give."

124
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,560
 Until God calls me out in a dream and says,

125
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,000
 "Pause, you need to look around you and really see."

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,280
 It is selfless, unconditional, and it flows from God.

127
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
 This is what we see from the scripture.

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
 It flows from God.

129
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,480
 It is selfless.

130
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,840
 It's looking at others.

131
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,800
 It is purposely looking for the need around us.

132
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,320
 God gave us His best, so we should also give our best.

133
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,440
 The love that God has poured in us during when we got saved

134
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,800
 is the same love He feels we should pour into other people.

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,680
 The primary way we share is action-oriented.

136
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,440
 The primary way God showed His love, it was action by sending Jesus Christ.

137
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,160
 The primary way He wants us to show our love is an action-oriented thing.

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,880
 By giving our time, by giving our resources, by giving our energy,

139
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,760
 by giving our prayer, and yes, by even giving financially to those who are in need.

140
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,280
 It is expressed through actions and deeds and not just words like we've just said.

141
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,800
 Turn with me to James 2 verse 8 and 18.

142
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,880
 It says, "Yes, indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the scriptures.

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,120
 Love your neighbor as yourself."

144
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
 Now, someone may argue some people have faith, others have good deeds,

145
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,280
 but I say, "How can you show me your faith if you don't have good deeds?"

146
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,640
 I will show you my faith by my deeds.

147
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,840
 Agape is a doing word.

148
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,960
 Well, the other three are primarily nouns.

149
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,040
 If you don't remember, you can go back to your English.

150
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,160
 Agape is a doing word.

151
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,840
 To truly live out the word agape, we must partner our words with our actions.

152
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,000
 We must also move forward with our deeds.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,520
 It is also a work of the Holy Spirit.

154
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,400
 Recently, we were having the Holy Spirit series and Galatians 5 verse 22 to 23 came up.

155
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,440
 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives.

156
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:06,720
 Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

157
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,640
 There is no law against these things.

158
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
 When we were learning about the fruit of the Spirit, the word love in that verse is agape.

159
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,800
 We cannot agape in and of ourselves.

160
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,800
 We need the Holy Spirit to help us to agape because it is countercultural to agape.

161
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
 Where a culture says we give to get something back,

162
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,640
 agape says I would disadvantage myself for the good of others.

163
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,040
 I recently came across a friend who sent me the story of Yvonne Roberts,

164
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,320
 the Welsh revivalist.

165
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,960
 He was a revivalist, a leading part of a revival in Wales in 1904 to 1905.

166
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,080
 Through the work of the Holy Spirit, there was a lot of prayer during that revival.

167
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,080
 There was a lot of people getting saved during that revival.

168
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,800
 The prisons were emptied during that revival.

169
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,680
 But the most amazing thing was there were no more people in need in Wales during that time,

170
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,840
 during that revival, because everybody was led by the Holy Spirit to begin to go to the churches

171
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,520
 and begin to give whatever the Holy Spirit was compelling them to give.

172
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,640
 What a beautiful view of how God wants us to meet each other's needs.

173
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:30,000
 It should flow from us to others just as it flowed from us to God, from God to us.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,680
 It should flow from us to others just as it flowed from God to us.

175
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,000
 In John 13, 34 to 35, "So now I am giving you a new commandment.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,760
 Love each other just as I have loved you.

177
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,960
 You should love each other.

178
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,440
 Your love for one another will prove to the world that you're my disciples."

179
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,440
 And the love should not stop with us because there are other people who need to see this love.

180
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,520
 God pours it into us so we can pour into other people.

181
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,720
 In Branches of Hope, we serve some people who don't know God.

182
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,400
 And the only way they will want to know God is when they see the love flowing from us to them.

183
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:16,960
 So with these four verses, we will go to an extended definition that I came up with.

184
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:26,480
 And the new definition for agape is, it is an unconditional, sacrificial love that flows from

185
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,200
 God through the Holy Spirit and leads us to acts of selfless love for others.

186
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,480
 Essentially, it is what Andrew spoke about and described in the first week,

187
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,520
 being willing to disadvantage ourselves for the advantage of our community.

188
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,440
 I truly believe that if everybody gave what God asked us to give,

189
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,840
 there would be no lack in the church of God.

190
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,080
 There would be no lack in the kingdom of God.

191
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,120
 This is a beautiful picture of how God has equipped each and every one of us

192
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
 to meet each other's needs.

193
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,120
 It's like a God community where no one lacks anything, whether it is prayer,

194
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
 whether it is fellowship, whether it is resources or anything.

195
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
 Because at any given time, we probably need one of those.

196
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,680
 And at any given time, we probably can give one of those.

197
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,240
 Allow me to share some of the acts of love that have been expressed to some of our clients

198
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,680
 through Branches of Hope recently.

199
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,640
 Our STOP program recently helped a man called Saul, a father of three from Indonesia.

200
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,080
 We had sold his most prized possession, a rice field,

201
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,520
 to cover a broker's fee who had promised him a high paying dishwashing job in Hong Kong.

202
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,120
 When he arrived in Hong Kong, his dreams were shattered.

203
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,840
 When he discovered the job was a lie.

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,400
 His tourist visa expired and his limited English made it difficult for him to navigate

205
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,560
 the immigration requirements to go back home.

206
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,560
 Thankfully, STOP's Indonesian caseworker, Daddy,

207
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,680
 accompanied him from the immigration office to the shelter and through the courtroom.

208
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,200
 Daddy interpreted and guided him through the complex administrative and legal processes.

209
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:14,000
 Saul was ultimately given a non-custodial sentence in order to return to Indonesia.

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
 STOP bought his ticket and helped him secure business startup funding

211
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,400
 from the International Organization for Migration.

212
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,440
 At the airport, Saul was overjoyed and grasped Daddy's hands tightly,

213
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
 his eyes shining with gratitude.

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,360
 The assistance Saul received not only sent him back home to safety,

215
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,680
 but it gave him a new lease of life.

216
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,520
 You might have also read the story of Lisa, an asylum seeker from Russia,

217
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,120
 in the Branches of Hope article published on World Refugee Day.

218
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,960
 Lisa is one of the 200,000 people in Hong Kong that Andrew spoke about

219
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,480
 last week who live in a 100 square foot home.

220
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,640
 She lives with her son, James, in a subdivided flat in Hong Kong.

221
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,640
 As she waits for her case to go through the lengthy process,

222
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,400
 she cannot work and has to survive on the limited government allowance.

223
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,520
 Through the generous donation of someone through the Branches of Hope

224
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,120
 STAR program, which provides an allowance for utilities,

225
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,800
 we will hear more about it later.

226
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,320
 Lisa and James can now use their fan and have the lights on for longer.

227
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,480
 This has not only provided a more comfortable environment for them,

228
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,920
 you know the heat in Hong Kong.

229
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,880
 Now they can turn their fan on,

230
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,000
 but it has given them a space for learning for James.

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,720
 So we are not only meeting the current needs,

232
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
 but we are speaking into destiny and the future.

233
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,600
 Through the Road and Star programs, our clients,

234
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,280
 they feel seen by us.

235
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,320
 They feel heard that somebody cares.

236
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 They feel cared for.

237
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,880
 They feel comforted.

238
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
 They feel covered.

239
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
 They feel hopeful.

240
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,760
 And essentially, they feel loved.

241
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,920
 They feel agapid.

242
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
 They feel agapid by us,

243
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,800
 just like we want to feel agapid by the community around us.

244
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,480
 The impact of other people's giving to Lisa and Paul and Saul

245
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
 have far greater impact on their lives than the people giving no.

246
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,480
 They are giving more than money.

247
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,440
 They are letting them know that they're not alone.

248
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,640
 What may be a meal for us is destiny for someone else.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,560
 Last week, Andrew gave us a model of engagement.

250
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,760
 And in that, he talked about Jesus weeping.

251
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,080
 And that was a key part for Jesus.

252
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,240
 He had to weep before he could speak.

253
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,120
 I believe for us, it's also very key for us to be able to really see

254
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,160
 and not just weep physically,

255
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,600
 but maybe weep emotionally, connecting to the situation,

256
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,080
 not just mentally connecting,

257
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,160
 empathetically connecting to the needs of the community around us.

258
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,800
 Today, we're going to play a four-minute audio video

259
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,160
 in order for us to approach and really see.

260
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,400
 Just a warning, there are sounds of violence

261
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,880
 for those who are sensitive in this audio.

262
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,440
 But this is not a story told by pictures and words.

263
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,080
 But it is by the sounds one might encounter

264
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,800
 along the perilous journey to safety.

265
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,760
 We invite you to close your eyes

266
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,800
 or even look at the subtitles on the screens.

267
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,600
 Whatever you feel will make you immerse

268
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,840
 in the situation and the experience.

269
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,760
 And imagine yourself walking in their shoes.

270
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,400
 At the end of the audio,

271
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
 Alex, the executive director of Branches of Hope,

272
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,880
 will come on stage to lead us through a collective exercise

273
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,600
 to drive home just how odious this journey

274
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
 from struggle to hope is.

275
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,080

 >> Everyone, my name is Alex. I'm the executive director at Branches of Hope.

306
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 How was that?

307
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I wonder if it was a way for you to approach this community a little bit more.

308
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 The audio journey that we just heard is based on real stories

309
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 that community members have told us over the years.

310
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And of course it reflects primarily the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers,

311
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 but those that we serve through the Stop Trafficking of Persons Program

312
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 are no less terrifying and traumatic.

313
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Even if your eyes are not filled with tears at this point,

314
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 what we hope is that your hearts are ready to weep

315
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 for the injustice that this experience symbolizes

316
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 and that we can collectively move from empathy towards compassion.

317
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 As Taz mentioned, to do that, we're going to go through a little bit of an exercise together.

318
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Now all of you should have gotten a little bit of a card on your chairs when you came in.

319
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 This is a resource card.

320
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And these resources reflect the resources that were needed

321
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 along this audio journey that we just heard to get from one stage to the next.

322
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 There's eight resources in total, but not everybody has all eight resources.

323
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And so to demonstrate ultimately how difficult this journey is,

324
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 I'm going to ask all of you please to stand.

325
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Please stand with me.

326
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Don't be shy, we're all doing it together.

327
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And basically what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out these resources one by one.

328
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And if you have that resource, well done, you get to keep standing.

329
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 But if you don't have that resource, I'm going to ask you to sit down.

330
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 So we're going to start off with the first one.

331
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 If you remember in the story right after the interruption of violence,

332
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 they had to pay a bus driver to get out of there.

333
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 If you have on your resource card the money for the bus, you can stay standing.

334
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 But if you don't, please sit down.

335
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Check your resource card.

336
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Oh, Pastor Stephen's out already, my goodness.

337
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Now if you have on your resource card, if you have passports for yourself and your family, stay standing.

338
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 But if you don't, sit down.

339
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 If you have on your resource cards the savings to pay for flights, you may stay standing.

340
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But if not, please sit down.

341
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 If you're one of the lucky people that on arrival to Hong Kong has a visa, you can stay standing.

342
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But if not, please sit down.

343
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 If you are able to communicate in Hong Kong with English or Cantonese, you can stay standing.

344
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But if you don't, please sit down.

345
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 You can see that slowly but surely we're all starting to sit down.

346
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 If you have money for food and shelter, you can stay standing.

347
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 But if you don't, please sit down.

348
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 And if you have local connections and resources, you may remain standing.

349
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 But if not, please sit down.

350
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 At this point, there's only a handful of people remaining standing.

351
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And those who are standing should have all eight resources on their card.

352
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 The final one being having your claim as an asylum seeker accepted and receiving refugee status

353
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 and being resettled to a third country.

354
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 If you can see around the room, the lonely ones who are left standing at this point,

355
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 that's about 1% of the total auditorium capacity.

356
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 99% of you are sitting down. 99% of you have not actually made it to this point of protection.

357
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 You have been thrust back into the turmoil that we heard.

358
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Thank you. You guys can sit down. Thank you so much.

359
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I think, honestly, this is what makes my heart weep the most.

360
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 This idea of being so close to ultimately safety and thriving your life

361
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 and to just then being sent back.

362
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And the fact is that not only is it hard to get to Hong Kong,

363
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 you need all those resources to get here, and not everybody has those resources,

364
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 but then in Hong Kong, less than 1%, over 99% of those who actually come to Hong Kong

365
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 ultimately fail in their seeking of protection and get sent back to their home countries.

366
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 At Branches of Hope, what we try to do is we try to come alongside the community

367
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 and we try to cut through the noise and the anxiety of what we just heard

368
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 and ultimately support them along their journey from struggle to hope.

369
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 We provide them with the care and the empowerment that is necessary to lead them to better futures.

370
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Without organizations like ours, the time in Hong Kong would be much more difficult,

371
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 a life caught in existential conundrums,

372
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 and the only room for personal growth being daily survival. That's it.

373
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And let's be brutally honest for a moment, for the majority of the people we serve,

374
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 the vast majority of the people we serve, there are no straightforward solutions.

375
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It is a life in perpetual limbo.

376
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 But this is why the work of Branches of Hope is a conscious and radical act of sacrificial love,

377
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 of agape, what Taz was mentioning and what Ed had referenced just earlier when he was sharing,

378
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 thank you so much Ed by the way, that we carry out every single day.

379
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I want to reflect on the powerful messages we've heard over the past three weeks

380
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 about justice, compassion, righteousness, and the call to love one another.

381
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Each sermon has reminded us that our faith is not just a private matter,

382
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 but a communal calling, a calling to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.

383
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 At Branches of Hope, we share that calling, and we will continue to pour agape into others,

384
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 God willing, as long as he pours love into us and into all of you.

385
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 The communities we serve might not be our flesh and blood,

386
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and they may certainly not be in a position to reciprocate in the season that they are in,

387
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 but that's not the point. We can still, and we must still love them regardless.

388
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 We must show them more than just empathy. We must practice compassion. We must act.

389
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 It is this conscious, radical, and continuous act of love, of agape, that is the linchpin,

390
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 connecting everything that we do at Branches of Hope with this day, once a year, with all of you,

391
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 to the message that Taz shared today, to Andrew's sermons before that,

392
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 and to the whole social justice mission of Divine Church.

393
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 If God has poured his love into you, I pray that nothing should restrict the onward flow of that love.

394
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And if I may dare be so bold, I pray that you direct some of that flow

395
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 to helping us serve the communities God has put on our hearts.

396
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 I pray that agape brings you to approach these communities, the refugees and asylum seekers,

397
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 those who have experienced trafficking and labor exploitation, the vulnerable, the marginalized,

398
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 and I pray that as you approach, you do not just see their needs,

399
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 but your heart is broken for what breaks God's,

400
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 and that this is what causes you to weep, not just for, but with our brothers and sisters.

401
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 If these prayers are answered, if your agape overflows, and you approach, and you see, and you weep,

402
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 and if it is genuine, I know in the depths of my heart that the only God-ordained outcome of this

403
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 is that you will be compelled to speak and to help us speak for the communities we serve.

404
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 It is the only logical conclusion.

405
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 I'm asking you to pour out some of what God has poured into you,

406
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 to support us in our conscious and radical act of love,

407
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 and to help us speak for the communities we serve.

408
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Last year on Branches of Hope Sunday, your tithes and offerings provided the casework support

409
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 for hundreds of people every single month.

410
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Your outpouring of love allowed us to run dozens of workshops for migrant workers,

411
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 and your prayers have sustained us as a team and as individuals to keep doing the work that we do.

412
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Your generosity laid the foundations for the launch of our STAR program,

413
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 which is a monthly financial assistance program providing rent and utility support to hundreds of people.

414
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Your support has also made it possible to weather fluctuations in donors.

415
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 With your help, over the last few months, we have been serving over 240 people every single month with this assistance.

416
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And as amazing as that is, it only represents a third of all the people who have been asking and applying for this assistance.

417
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 A third!

418
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Together, we can do more.

419
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 With your support today, we hope to continue providing the casework support so essential to our communities,

420
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and we hope to increase the post-secondary education assistance to cover five students for their tertiary education.

421
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 With the help of a new team member, we hope to revive our adult education and development services.

422
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 And besides supporting us with your tithes today, you can also sign up to become a monthly donor, a monthly supporter at our booth outside.

423
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 You can choose for whatever purpose you want to have your support going to,

424
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 whether it is the STAR program, or whether it's our education programs, or even our general service fund.

425
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 The bottom line though is that any regular amount will help us provide financial stability to hundreds of people.

426
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Let me give you an example.

427
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 If just 10 people from this service today make a commitment that every month you will donate $250, that's maybe two lunches worth.

428
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 If you donate $250 every single month, 10 of you, that would be enough money for us to be able to provide the STAR program assistance to five more people.

429
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 If we have 10 people from every service today to sign up to do that, we're supporting 15 more people.

430
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 It's that simple.

431
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 And if you feel truly overwhelmed with compassion and the agape of God, then maybe the time has come for you to prayerfully consider a career with Branches of Hope.

432
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 We always have opportunities and are looking for Christians to serve alongside us to do the work that we do.

433
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 For all of these things, for all of the things that might catch your interest, please speak to my colleagues outside.

434
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 They're very, very friendly and very happy to help you out.

435
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 To those of you who have been walking so faithfully alongside us and the communities we serve all of these years, we cannot thank you enough.

436
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 And to those of you who may only just be getting to know us or have not felt necessarily the call to support us yet, I pray that today is an encouragement to you to embrace our mission.

437
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 I pray that the Holy Spirit moves among you to give and give generously out of compassion and conviction.

438
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 May your love be like the water gushing from the rock in the desert.

439
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 May God bless and multiply your offerings so that we may continue his work and together support the communities we serve in their journey from struggle to hope.

440
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Most importantly, though, I pray that these past three weeks have been a blessing to each and every one of you and that it has offered restoration in your relationships with God, your relationships with yourselves, your relationship with each other, and your relationship with creation.

441
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 May we all continue to grow to be big people. Thank you.

442
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Wonderful.

443
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 I wonder if you could all stand with me.

444
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And so we're going to now move into a specific time together of agape-ing through our giving.

445
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And I want you to understand something really importantly right now.

446
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 100% of what is given in our tithes and offerings across our service today, whatever is given in this moment across our services today, are going to Branches of Hope.

447
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 So none of this is going to the vine. It's not going to our normal upkeep.

448
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 100% of what you give right now is going to give immediately to Branches of Hope and the work that you've been hearing about today.

449
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 So your tithes and offerings today are connecting directly with that need.

450
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 In a moment, you'll have the opportunity to give like you would normally do.

451
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 We'll have our hosts pass out the buckets amongst us.

452
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 On your chair, there's the usual giving envelopes that you see every week.

453
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 You can fill that in and whatever.

454
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Again, all of that money is going to go directly to Branches of Hope.

455
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Behind me in a moment, you'll see the digital ways to give like normal.

456
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 100% of that goes to Branches of Hope.

457
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 That's what we're going to do right now.

458
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 This is a practical way for us to support this organization.

459
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Then after the service, you can by all means connect with them more, have a look at that merchandise, maybe sign up for that monthly support as well.

460
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 But I wonder whether we could do this in a place of an attitude of just the Spirit being amongst us, the joy of what it is to be a part of the gospel, to serve in this way.

461
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 So would you just close your eyes with me and bow your head?

462
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Father, we are grateful that we are a worshipping community.

463
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 By a worshipping community, we're not just singing songs to you.

464
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 We're living lives that reveal the gospel to the world.

465
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 We thank you for what Taz has beautifully shown us out of Scripture today.

466
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 There's a gapay love that is not a feeling but an action.

467
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 We thank you that as we've heard from Alex, that there are very practical direct needs that are within this community that our giving today is going to support.

468
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Lord, I want to pray now.

469
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 And I want you just to take a moment.

470
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 This is the part of the services just between you and God.

471
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 But just take a moment, just to ask the Holy Spirit to impress upon you how you are to react and act today.

472
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 What is it that the Lord might be calling you to give as your tithes and offerings?

473
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And what is it that he might be asking you to do to continue to support the work of Branches of Hope in the months ahead?

474
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 So we just invite you to come Holy Spirit.

475
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Come Holy Spirit.

476
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 And we're going to do this act of offering through a moment of worship.

477
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Our band are just going to lead us in a time of worship and the hosts are going to hand out the buckets to you.

478
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 Let's celebrate together as we give joyfully and cheerfully to the work of Branches of Hope.

479
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 [Music]
