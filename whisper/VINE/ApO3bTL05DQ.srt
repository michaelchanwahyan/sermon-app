1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 We pray in Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 Amen.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,920
 Let's look at this first picture.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,340
 This is Immaculée Ilebagiza.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,200
 In 1994, she was a university student in Rwanda.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,260
 During the Rwanda genocide,

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,460
 the genocide found its way to her village.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,320
 During this time, a pastor grabbed Immaculée

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,700
 and seven other women and hid them in his en suite bathroom.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,540
 It was a small room, four foot by three foot.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,300
 He moved his dresser to hide the door,

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,440
 and it was there they stayed for 91 days

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,200
 in order to survive the genocide.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,060
 After the genocide was over,

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,420
 Immaculée found herself standing in front of the very person

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,680
 who killed her own mother and her brothers.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,020
 And she said the words, "I forgive you."

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,340
 She later went on to be an advocate for reconciliation,

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,060
 going on to speak all over the world.

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,140
 And when asked about this encounter

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,380
 with this man who murdered her family, she said this,

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,120
 "I believe that we can heal Rwanda and our world

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,880
 "by healing one heart at a time."

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,020
 This next photo was taken in 1983.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,200
 This is Pope John Paul II

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,340
 visiting Mehmet Ali Aksa in his jail cell.

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,620
 Two years before this, Mehmet attempted

28
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,420
 to assassinate the pope,

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,660
 shooting at him multiple rounds in St. Peter's Square.

30
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,160
 Two of those bullets hit the pope.

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,900
 While suffering severe blood loss,

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,400
 the pope was able to survive.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,980
 He made a full recovery, and when he was able to,

34
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,580
 about a year and a half later,

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,640
 he decided to go visit Mehmet in his jail cell

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,860
 to offer him forgiveness face to face.

37
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,360
 This was the picture of that conversation.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,700
 27 years after this conversation,

39
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,020
 it was the pope himself who advocated for Mehmet

40
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,660
 to be pardoned and released from jail.

41
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,400
 In fact, at the end of his life, near the end of his life,

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,560
 Mehmet was quoted as saying, "The pope is my friend.

43
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,200
 "The very man he tried to kill."

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,840
 This next photo is a picture of me with my own son.

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,880
 I had the rare opportunity to spend a full day with him

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,300
 as my elder son was going on a school trip,

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,080
 so we were planning what to do,

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,460
 and he only asked for one thing,

49
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,800
 "Take me to Universal Studios."

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
 And I was like, at this point,

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,600
 we were in Singapore for about three years now,

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,660
 so we've been many times, okay?

53
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,360
 Universal Studios in Singapore is not even that big,

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,480
 especially when one of the major areas being renovated,

55
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,880
 so I was like, "Buddy, we've gone a lot,

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,460
 "it's very expensive, let's do something else."

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,700
 I see some people, "Pfft."

58
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,360
 Visibly sad, my son gives me a hug,

59
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,560
 and he says, "It's okay, Dad."

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,440
 Now, my son's 10, okay?

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,500
 I didn't know he knew verse psychology.

62
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,100
 I didn't know that he accessed Jedi mind trick powers,

63
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,060
 but where was that picture taken?

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,320
 Universal Studios.

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,900
 (audience laughing)

66
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,160
 On the Transformers ride.

67
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,680
 Forgiveness has the power to change a country.

68
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,280
 Forgiveness has the power to change a man.

69
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,680
 Forgiveness has the power to change people's decisions,

70
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,920
 and in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ,

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,180
 forgiveness has the power to change history.

72
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,440
 Today, I'll be continuing our forgiveness sermon series,

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
 and I'll be looking at the more practical side

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,240
 of what forgiveness is.

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,800
 Why don't you join me as I pray before we really start?

76
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,840
 Jesus, let the words of my mouth

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,320
 and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight,

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,780
 O Lord, my rock and redeemer.

79
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,420
 Amen, amen.

80
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,800
 Right, as introduced, I am super excited

81
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,560
 to be back here at the Vine.

82
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,600
 So yes, I know some of you, but I don't know a lot of you,

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,440
 so I do wanna introduce myself again.

84
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,600
 Yes, my name is Derek, I'm based in Singapore.

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,320
 I work for a company called Momenta Group,

86
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
 and I primarily function as an executive coach

87
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,720
 and a corporate trainer, and more recently,

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,660
 I'm in charge of our sales team in Singapore.

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,100
 I had a lot more to say about this,

90
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,440
 but Ellison told me, "Stop talking

91
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,760
 "about all this stuff that you do."

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,300
 Sorry that I have a job after pastoring.

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,640
 Jeez.

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,000
 He's praying for me to not be successful

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,600
 so I can come back to the Vine.

96
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,640
 Anyway, so yes, I was a pastor, though,

97
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,520
 and that's more relevant to everyone here today.

98
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,040
 From 2003 to 2010, I had the honor of pastoring

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,320
 our young adults at 180, and a lot of the people

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,360
 that I pastored then are currently in leadership

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,800
 here at this church, and it's an honor

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,000
 to see a lot of you here still now.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,200
 2010, 2014, I went to seminary.

104
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,240
 Yes, I served as a pastor, and then I went to seminary.

105
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,100
 That's kinda how we rolled back then at the Vine.

106
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,480
 Not anymore, not anymore.

107
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,880
 I guarantee you we're different now.

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
 2014, I returned to serve under a young man

109
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,560
 named Andrew Gardner and help pastor this church,

110
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,160
 and I joined with Pastor Carlo

111
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,720
 to form the pastoral leadership team.

112
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,640
 In 2019, I felt the Lord called me to focus primarily

113
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,720
 on executive coaching and corporate training,

114
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,160
 so that's when I was last here to speak here.

115
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,560
 So I have a deep, deep history with this church.

116
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,840
 This is my home church.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,360
 In fact, in February 2001, I became a Christian

118
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,040
 at my very first Vine service, so this is home to me.

119
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,880
 You all are home to me, and I celebrate you all

120
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,640
 from Singapore, and it is an honor to be back.

121
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,440
 So pastoral team, oh, not pastoral, all right,

122
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,400
 Carlo and Allison, thank you for having me back.

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,680
 And of course, Andrew, I just wanna say

124
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,420
 I love you and I miss you.

125
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,320
 We're doing fine.

126
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,240
 Don't worry about us.

127
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,440
 I know he's gonna watch to make sure I'm

128
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
 preaching from the Bible and all that stuff.

129
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,800
 So, hi, Andrew.

130
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,440
 Okay, so let's get going.

131
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,120
 So for those of you that need it,

132
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,720
 I'm gonna just share a roadmap for what I'm gonna do,

133
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
 'cause some people really, ah, what are we talking about?

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,640
 Where are we?

135
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,760
 So I'm gonna look at what is forgiveness.

136
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,860
 I'm gonna look at what is not forgiveness.

137
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,160
 I'm gonna talk about why we should forgive,

138
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
 how do we forgive, and then I'm gonna do

139
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,320
 a kind of a now what at the end, okay?

140
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,240
 So this is our roadmap.

141
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,060
 This is where we're gonna go.

142
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,400
 So firstly, what is forgiveness?

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,100
 And before I start this in earnest,

144
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,240
 my mandate was to not give the kind of

145
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,360
 biblical foundation of forgiveness.

146
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,880
 Pastor Promise did that last week,

147
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
 and if you haven't done that,

148
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,280
 please go listen to it if you haven't done so.

149
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,800
 And if you are wondering, Promise,

150
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
 when I was, Promise came to us as an intern.

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
 He came onto my team.

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
 He's not here, so I can talk about him.

153
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,560
 So he now has taken my role, my title, and my haircut.

154
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,760
 So, you know, just give him some love.

155
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,000
 He's wondering if it's a midlife crisis.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,960
 It absolutely is.

157
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,600
 So just help pray for your pastors.

158
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
 They need it.

159
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,640
 So please listen to that sermon if you haven't done so.

160
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,560
 That's the biblical understanding.

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,800
 So I'm going to give more of a practical one.

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,720
 So, and from apart from scripture

163
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,480
 and our shared experience as believers,

164
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,160
 there's actually been a lot of academic research

165
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,420
 on forgiveness, and really, it's incredible

166
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,360
 what the transformative power of forgiveness is.

167
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,320
 And before we get into that part,

168
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,680
 I must say that I am not a therapist, okay?

169
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,600
 I'm not actually a certified therapist,

170
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,200
 but what I am is I have over 13 years

171
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,400
 of pastoral experience and in counseling.

172
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
 I also am a certified executive coach since 2011,

173
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,420
 and I myself have been through years of counseling.

174
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,800
 So I come at it from a type of practitioner,

175
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,920
 and I'm also a client, you know?

176
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,420
 So I have a lot of experience in this.

177
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,200
 So let's look at what forgiveness is.

178
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,920
 The American Psychological Association, the APA,

179
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,800
 puts it like this, and I really want you

180
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
 to open your mind to what the secular,

181
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,160
 clinical description is.

182
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,000
 It's fascinating.

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,360
 Let's look at what forgiveness is.

184
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,720
 Forgiveness involves willfully putting aside

185
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,200
 feelings of resentment towards someone

186
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,460
 who has committed a wrong, been unfair,

187
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,600
 or hurtful, or otherwise harmed you in some way.

188
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
 Forgiveness is not merely accepting what happened

189
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
 or ceasing to be angry.

190
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,560
 Rather, it involves a voluntary transformation

191
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,560
 of your feelings, attitude, and behavior

192
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,400
 so that you are no longer dominated by resentment

193
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,740
 and can express compassion, generosity, or the like

194
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,440
 toward the person who wronged you.

195
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,000
 This is the clinical description of what forgiveness is.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,640
 So if you break this down, there is a lot happening, right?

197
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,520
 Here, you have to willingfully decide,

198
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,480
 I am going to put aside resentment, right?

199
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,560
 I am going to decide to willfully put that aside.

200
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,360
 It's not just stopping to be angry.

201
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,040
 There is a decision that I was being full of resentment

202
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,760
 and anger, but now I'm not going to access that anymore.

203
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,900
 But then there's the second part of transforming

204
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,180
 those feelings, and attitudes, and behaviors

205
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,180
 into something else, compassion, generosity, and the like.

206
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:42,640
 So forgiveness, there's this both internal transformation,

207
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,000
 but there's also an external one as well.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,320
 There's a lot happening in this phrase

209
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,220
 that we say to forgive someone.

210
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,980
 And actually, in my preparation, I came across a number

211
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,040
 of different adaptations of this,

212
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,780
 and for today's purposes, I came across another one

213
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,280
 which I think you'll find very interesting.

214
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,500
 There are two therapists, Enright and Fitzgibbons,

215
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,800
 and they wrote a book, "Forgiveness Therapy,

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,520
 "An Empirical Guide for Resolving Anger and Restoring Hope."

217
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,080
 Fascinating title, and I'm working my way through this book.

218
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,860
 But I want you to hear their definition of forgiveness.

219
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,840
 A willingness to abandon one's right to resentment,

220
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,960
 negative judgment, and indifferent behavior

221
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,820
 towards the one who unjustly injured us,

222
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,820
 while fostering the undeserved qualities

223
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,280
 of compassion, generosity, and even love.

224
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:50,040
 A willingness to abandon resentment,

225
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,240
 negative judgment, and indifference.

226
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,220
 That phrase is powerful, because if you've ever been hurt,

227
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,120
 if you've been abused, if evil has been done to you,

228
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,880
 you have an internal right to access things like anger,

229
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,280
 frustration, right?

230
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,320
 If that has been done to me, especially if it was unjust,

231
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,640
 then surely, internally, I can be angry.

232
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,240
 I could even want justice, maybe even revenge.

233
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,380
 That's my right, 'cause it was done to me.

234
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,080
 But in therapy, I love this definition,

235
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,880
 'cause it's saying, yes, you have that right,

236
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,660
 but you are willing to abandon that right.

237
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,620
 That you are saying, I am no longer going to access

238
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,120
 this frustration, this anger, this pain, this revenge.

239
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,240
 And then, not just not access this,

240
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,880
 but then I'm going to now transform.

241
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,800
 And I love this phrase, I'm gonna foster this thing,

242
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,520
 and it says this, the undeserved qualities.

243
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,780
 It's not deserved.

244
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,520
 But I choose to offer it anyway.

245
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,680
 You know what this is?

246
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,120
 I don't know if Enright and Fitzgibbons are Christian,

247
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,000
 but I think they stumbled on a beautiful,

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,920
 secular description of what grace is.

249
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,600
 This is a beautiful description.

250
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,640
 I am no longer gonna access that resentment,

251
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,800
 and I'm gonna transform and foster

252
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,000
 something completely undeserved.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
 Compassion, generosity.

254
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,360
 I love that, I love seeing this.

255
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
 I was so struck,

256
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,300
 because I felt that this was

257
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,960
 the gospel being explained to me.

258
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:35,200
 True forgiveness, then, is both an internal transformation

259
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,840
 and an outward change of feelings,

260
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,140
 attitudes, words, and behaviors.

261
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,520
 It is a both/and.

262
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,680
 There are two things happening, my internal world

263
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,040
 and what's happening in my external world, too.

264
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,760
 Not my words, this is the clinical definition.

265
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,860
 So if that's the case, then,

266
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,180
 if this is what forgiveness is,

267
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,660
 well, then we can talk about what forgiveness isn't.

268
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,480
 And I'll say this, forgiveness is not just saying the words,

269
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,320
 I forgive you, right?

270
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,280
 It's not just saying, nah, I forgive you,

271
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,080
 or in today's world, just send the text, I forgive you.

272
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,320
 And that's not it, because what we read there

273
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,920
 is that there is an internal transformation

274
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,600
 and an external change as well.

275
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,880
 So it cannot just be words.

276
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,920
 And if any of you work with teenagers,

277
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,280
 you can see how someone could say something

278
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,440
 like I forgive you or I'm sorry, and not mean it.

279
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,220
 I have a teenage boy, when I catch them fighting

280
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,160
 with my other son and I make him apologize,

281
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,600
 I can tell he doesn't mean it.

282
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,720
 That's not what true forgiveness is, right?

283
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,040
 There has to be both an internal and external change.

284
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,400
 There's another phrase that you hear a lot,

285
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,440
 oh, just to forgive and forget.

286
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,360
 Let's just forgive and move on.

287
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,980
 And you know, I fundamentally disagree with that.

288
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,280
 Because you know what, even Jesus, in his resurrected body,

289
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,800
 he did not cleanse his body of the scars, right?

290
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,760
 You ever think about that?

291
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,140
 He went to Thomas, put your hand on my scar, feel it,

292
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,260
 because that proves I have overcome death.

293
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,300
 See, if Jesus didn't remove his scars,

294
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,120
 I know why I still have mine.

295
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,860
 'Cause I can say, look at the power of Jesus

296
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,920
 through my scars.

297
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,720
 So it's not about just removing these thoughts,

298
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,820
 it's about addressing them and saying,

299
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,900
 because of the love and power of Jesus Christ,

300
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,340
 I stand healed.

301
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,760
 So no, it's not about forgetting.

302
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,900
 And this last one really triggers me.

303
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,340
 'Cause people, I've actually been in a coaching situation

304
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,440
 where someone said, I'm not gonna forgive,

305
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,980
 because I don't wanna be seen to be taken advantage of.

306
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,120
 I don't wanna be weak.

307
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,280
 And when I hear that, there's something inside me

308
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,980
 that breaks because of the situations

309
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,520
 I've been a part of in my life.

310
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,380
 Now before I move on, this is a trigger warning.

311
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,580
 I'm about to talk about death by drunk driving

312
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,240
 and sexual abuse.

313
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,980
 If you feel that you cannot be here for this conversation

314
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,220
 or that you need to take an exit,

315
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,500
 please go ahead, take a bathroom break, take a walk,

316
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,860
 come back in a few minutes.

317
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,700
 Thank you.

318
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:32,500
 When I hear this phrase, to forgive is to be weak,

319
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,760
 I think about when I was in university.

320
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,300
 I was a first year in University of Michigan,

321
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,660
 which is in 1997, for those of you

322
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,060
 who wanna know how old I am.

323
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,740
 (audience laughing)

324
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,460
 And it was the middle of winter,

325
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,980
 so it was snowy on the ground, and my friend is a Korean.

326
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,340
 And in Korean American culture especially,

327
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,740
 as soon as Koreans hang out,

328
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,340
 they understand immediately who's older, right?

329
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,700
 And they have this concept of hyun,

330
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,180
 which is the older brother, older student,

331
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,540
 and there's a respect factor.

332
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,740
 And the older sibling, the older person

333
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,060
 is supposed to kind of protect the younger person.

334
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,640
 So this is hyun, you're my elder, take care of me.

335
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,780
 So these guys, I wasn't with them,

336
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,860
 but these guys were drinking,

337
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,260
 and they were having a great time.

338
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,660
 And the hyun, the older student says to my friend,

339
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,900
 "Hey, we need to get some cigarettes,

340
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,340
 "we're out of cigarettes."

341
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,460
 So he's like, "Okay."

342
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,740
 Jumped in the car, drove off.

343
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,380
 Middle of the night, they were drinking,

344
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,580
 snow on the ground.

345
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,420
 Sure enough, that's elder student skid off the road,

346
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,520
 smashed into a tree.

347
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,480
 It was later reported because of the seatbelt,

348
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,280
 the driver sustained minor issues,

349
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,320
 but my friend was not wearing a seatbelt.

350
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,900
 Flew right through their windshield.

351
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,840
 I'll spare you the details,

352
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,040
 but he was later declared dead at the scene.

353
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,840
 Two days later was the funeral.

354
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,780
 And when my friend's mom came face to face

355
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,060
 with the driver of that car,

356
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,660
 she just broke and sobbed.

357
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,940
 And she went to this young man,

358
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,940
 and she just kept hitting him like this,

359
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,220
 thumping on his chest.

360
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,920
 And she was yelling something in Korean,

361
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
 and I turned to my Korean friends,

362
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,600
 "What is she saying?"

363
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,660
 And she was saying, "You were supposed to protect him!

364
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,500
 "You were supposed to protect him!

365
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,180
 "Because he's hyun, he's the oldest."

366
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,140
 And she just kept hitting him,

367
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,740
 and it was just this gut-wrenching moment

368
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,600
 where we were all just watching.

369
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,860
 And eventually she ran out of energy,

370
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,600
 and then she just hugged this man,

371
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,660
 and just continued to sob into his chest.

372
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:51,280
 "You're gonna tell me that this woman was weak

373
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,260
 "to extend just that little bit of forgiveness

374
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,860
 "to this person who just accidentally killed her son?

375
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,300
 "No, no way.

376
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,360
 "That was the most incredible example of strength

377
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,560
 "I could ever think of."

378
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,140
 As a pastor, I've literally stood with a person

379
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,580
 who has experienced sexual abuse in their life,

380
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,900
 and they decide to, in prayer,

381
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,820
 forgive the person who abused them.

382
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,420
 And then this person was gripping their fists so tight,

383
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,620
 tears streaming, and their whole body was tense,

384
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,580
 and they uttered the word, "I forgive them."

385
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,140
 Is that weakness?

386
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,560
 It is the most powerful, strongest thing

387
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,980
 you could possibly do.

388
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,660
 To forgive is no weakness.

389
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,200
 It is powerful.

390
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,200
 So what's actually happening when you forgive?

391
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,900
 What's going on, both internally, what's happening?

392
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,740
 What is the process?

393
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,000
 Why should we even do this?

394
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,100
 Let me give you the academic research, okay?

395
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,480
 Look, I'm not a therapist,

396
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,940
 but I wanted you to see all of the research

397
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,920
 that I brought here.

398
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,120
 And when I say research, I do mean Chat GPT,

399
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,560
 in case you're wondering.

400
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,120
 I told you that I'm not a therapist.

401
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,160
 You're all wondering, as soon as I put this up,

402
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,300
 yes, it is Chat GPT,

403
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,660
 but I did at least check these resources.

404
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,500
 Come on now.

405
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,360
 But look at this list.

406
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,640
 Reduce blood pressure.

407
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,920
 Lower stress levels.

408
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,120
 Improved heart health.

409
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,380
 Reduce chronic pain.

410
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,800
 Better sleep quality.

411
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,380
 Improved immune function.

412
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,740
 Lower risk of heart attack.

413
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,220
 These are all proven by academic research.

414
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,680
 This is what happens when we forgive.

415
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 So this list alone should be great reasons

416
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,220
 why we forgive, right?

417
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,460
 There's so many amazing benefits.

418
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,760
 Yet we don't.

419
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,060
 Right?

420
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,400
 Okay, maybe you're not a therapist.

421
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,540
 Maybe you don't do research,

422
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,160
 but maybe you can anecdotally also prove this.

423
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,000
 Think about it like this.

424
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,680
 Think about the opposite.

425
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,580
 Let's say you've been abused.

426
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,920
 Let's say you've experienced some evil.

427
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,040
 Something has happened where you hold this resentment,

428
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,620
 this anger, this bitterness,

429
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,280
 and instead of releasing it in forgiveness,

430
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,500
 you put it inside you and you carry it.

431
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 What is that gonna do to you over time?

432
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,020
 Think about the stress that you're gonna live with.

433
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,940
 Think about how your quality of sleep

434
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,620
 is gonna be impacted, right?

435
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,600
 All of these things we know

436
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,580
 because probably many of us experience this.

437
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,340
 So you can appreciate this research

438
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,080
 because we know the opposite.

439
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,900
 And maybe you're experiencing exactly that right now.

440
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,700
 If you live a life of forgiveness,

441
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,240
 we know from the research it increases your health

442
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,880
 and your quality of life.

443
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,460
 That's not me.

444
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,140
 That's the research.

445
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,980
 But why don't we do this?

446
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,540
 Because it's so difficult, right?

447
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,420
 I mean, I'll say, so Dr. Aaron T. Beck,

448
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,780
 who is another clinical psychologist,

449
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,740
 and he was considered to be the father

450
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,200
 of our modern day style of therapy,

451
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,220
 which is cognitive behavior therapy, so CBT.

452
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,880
 He was known to say virtually all of human disturbance

453
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,860
 is the result of blaming others,

454
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,220
 blaming society or blaming self

455
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,620
 for things that have happened.

456
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,620
 And for such blaming, the need for forgiveness arises.

457
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,500
 So what he's saying is virtually all of the things

458
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,740
 that we struggle with in therapy

459
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,580
 is that we need to forgive someone

460
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,540
 and we can't do it on our own.

461
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,660
 That's why there's so many therapists.

462
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,260
 That's why there's so many counselors in this world.

463
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,980
 And what the predominant thing that people need to do

464
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,880
 when they see a counselor is to forgive.

465
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,760
 And you know, honestly, I am really amazed and impressed

466
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,980
 and hopeful for the younger generations,

467
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,860
 for the Gen Zs and the Gen Alphas,

468
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,240
 because they're trailblazing to normalize therapy.

469
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,740
 Right, do you know how hard it is to get a boomer

470
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,920
 or my Gen Zs, Gen Xs,

471
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,080
 do you know how hard it is to get us to therapy?

472
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,880
 We need to be falling apart before we're gonna admit

473
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,440
 that I need help and I'm gonna talk to someone about it.

474
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,160
 But the younger people,

475
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
 some of the younger people that I lead,

476
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,200
 no, I'm going to therapy, it's Friday.

477
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,260
 I'm like, okay.

478
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,400
 (audience laughing)

479
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,880
 You know, I'm like, great.

480
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,860
 You know, not only are you doing it,

481
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,560
 but let's just talk about it.

482
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,340
 Like, the older generations, you'll never know.

483
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,640
 And that's why I think there's hope.

484
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,840
 Things are gonna change.

485
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,800
 But if this is a kind of physical, academic reason,

486
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,240
 what about a spiritual, scriptural reason?

487
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,760
 Now, I know my mandate isn't to do a biblical thing,

488
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,320
 but I'm gonna do it anyway, 'cause I am.

489
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,760
 So, number one, right?

490
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,960
 This is a biblical, scriptural, theological construct

491
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,840
 for why we should forgive.

492
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,840
 One, 1 John 4, 7-8, we were dead in our transgressions.

493
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,200
 Right, we are separate from God.

494
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,780
 Our destiny was determined to be separate from God

495
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,240
 because of the sin in our life.

496
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,880
 That is truth as we understand it as believers, right?

497
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,320
 So, our destiny is broken,

498
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,660
 and we're gonna be separate from God.

499
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,300
 However, we know that Jesus has come.

500
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,840
 In Romans 3-23, it says that all have fallen short,

501
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,800
 but Jesus redeems us through the cross, right?

502
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,280
 So, our eternity now has changed.

503
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,400
 We have been justified to be

504
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,280
 in eternal relationship with Jesus,

505
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,880
 but that's in eternity.

506
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,960
 What about today?

507
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,160
 Well, right now, you and I have the Holy Spirit.

508
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,420
 We are currently and consistently,

509
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,480
 in every single moment, sanctified by the presence

510
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,560
 of the Holy Spirit, according to 1 John 1-9.

511
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,520
 So, not only is our eternity set,

512
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,920
 but our current presence now is sanctified

513
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,520
 and cleansed by the Holy Spirit.

514
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,640
 But not only that, our status has changed,

515
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,320
 because now, Romans 8-17, we are co-heirs with Christ.

516
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,800
 What an amazing thing, that our eternity is now changed,

517
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,720
 and our presence is now forgiven,

518
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,200
 and we are now status changed,

519
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,680
 because we're co-heirs with Christ.

520
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,340
 Now, what do we do with this new life and new status?

521
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,880
 Ephesians 4-32 says, "Love."

522
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,900
 Love one another,

523
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,520
 because love, 'cause you have been loved.

524
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,040
 And the exclamation point is in Colossians 3-13,

525
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,660
 "Forgive, because you have been forgiven."

526
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,580
 (claps)

527
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,500
 So, not only do we forgive as believers,

528
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,180
 because we have been forgiven,

529
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,540
 because Jesus, our Lord and Savior,

530
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,820
 has exemplified a life of forgiveness,

531
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:04,480
 and we have been commanded to do so.

532
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,320
 So, if you want a scriptural foundation for this,

533
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,020
 this is it.

534
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,960
 We have been redeemed.

535
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,520
 What do we do with that redemption?

536
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,020
 This is a theological construct for forgiveness

537
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,500
 based on the life and work of Jesus,

538
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,000
 but what about outside of Jesus?

539
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,140
 What about the whole Bible?

540
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,180
 Well, the Old Testament is full of examples

541
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,260
 of God forgiving his people.

542
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,500
 They constantly turn their backs on them.

543
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,780
 The Israelites say, "We don't even remember who you are,"

544
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,640
 and God delivers them and forgives them, repeatedly.

545
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,260
 The New Testament, after Jesus was resurrected,

546
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,020
 and he ascended to heaven,

547
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,340
 the early church is full of stories of forgiveness,

548
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,800
 but I'm gonna bring out one, and that's Stephen.

549
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,180
 After Jesus ascended to heaven,

550
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,900
 the early church started to erupt,

551
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,780
 and people were saying, "Jesus is the Messiah,"

552
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,800
 and Stephen was calling out the Pharisees,

553
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,840
 the religious order, saying,

554
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,860
 "And you were the ones that killed him."

555
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,180
 Now, to say that someone was Messiah in those days,

556
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,320
 it is punishable by death because it is blasphemy,

557
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,740
 so the religious leaders had every right

558
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,260
 to take Stephen out and to stone him to death,

559
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,360
 and that is exactly what they did.

560
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:36,940
 Acts 7, 59, as they started to stone Stephen,

561
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,020
 Stephen says, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."

562
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,220
 He falls to his knees, and as he was being stoned,

563
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,220
 he said, "Jesus, do not hold their sin against them."

564
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:58,620
 You want examples of forgiveness?

565
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,900
 This man was being stoned to death,

566
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,400
 and his last words were, "Forgive them."

567
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,760
 This is the rich history we have as believers.

568
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,340
 We forgive because there are physical and mental benefits.

569
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,420
 We forgive because we have the example of Jesus,

570
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,240
 our Lord and Savior.

571
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,900
 We forgive because we've commanded to,

572
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,540
 but we also forgive because we have this amazing history

573
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,860
 from creation all the way till today,

574
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,320
 and it will continue forevermore until Jesus comes back.

575
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,180
 Forgiveness earmarks us as believers.

576
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,140
 And you know, honestly, I forget

577
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,080
 that this is our foundation sometimes.

578
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,860
 Now, since I've been coaching since 2011,

579
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,540
 and since 2019, I've been coaching primarily

580
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,980
 in a non-Christian space,

581
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,300
 and honestly, it's just been amazing sometimes.

582
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,460
 There was a situation where I was coaching

583
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,420
 the number three person in an organization,

584
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,060
 and it just so happened this person

585
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,820
 had developed a very negative relationship with their CEO.

586
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,720
 It was so bad that this person would just be triggered

587
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,580
 seeing that person, and they couldn't communicate,

588
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,220
 and she was losing sleep, and she was just having anxiety,

589
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,480
 and so it ended up, she decided,

590
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,040
 "I'm gonna resign from this position," which is fair,

591
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,560
 but her contract stipulated

592
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
 that she had many months left to serve out.

593
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,820
 So as I coached her, I was saying,

594
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,620
 "You know, how do you want these last few months to go?"

595
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,200
 I don't know, maybe I'll just avoid him.

596
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,480
 And I said, "Well, I don't know if that's really possible.

597
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,840
 "Four months is a long time, and you gotta hand over."

598
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,980
 And I just explored.

599
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,840
 I said, "Is it okay if I have a suggestion?"

600
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,680
 I said, "Would you like to kind of

601
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,820
 "take a look at this relationship?

602
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,480
 "There's a lot of time for us to just address it."

603
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,960
 I used that phrase, "Let's just address it."

604
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,180
 I didn't say, "Why don't you forgive him?"

605
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,300
 I didn't say, "Hey, let's forgive this.

606
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,820
 "Let's reconcile."

607
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,840
 I didn't say any of that.

608
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,040
 And I'll never forget this, and forgive my language.

609
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,420
 She looked at me and she said, "What?

610
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,760
 "No, I'm gonna make his life a living hell."

611
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,960
 And I was like, "What?"

612
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,520
 I didn't say that, 'cause if I'm doing that

613
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,580
 in a professional context, that would not be appropriate

614
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,320
 for me to say, "What, what's wrong with you?"

615
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,320
 (audience laughing)

616
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,560
 But I realized, this is a clash of values.

617
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,040
 Because for me, when I heard that this person

618
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,200
 was experiencing anxiety, that there was a breakdown

619
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,480
 in the relationship, that she just struggled

620
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,920
 to even see that person, I'm like, "Why don't you forgive?"

621
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,800
 And I say that because I've been forgiven by Jesus.

622
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
 Why not?

623
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,320
 This is on the tip of my tongue.

624
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,720
 It's right there because I'm a believer.

625
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,880
 She does not have that context.

626
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,880
 So for her, it was extremely natural

627
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,240
 for her to access revenge.

628
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,360
 Right?

629
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,520
 This person hurt me, wronged me,

630
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,200
 therefore, I'm gonna, I have, remember the definition?

631
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,660
 I have the right to access resentment.

632
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:22,440
 And I was like, "Wow, we have completely

633
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,840
 "different foundations."

634
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,760
 If you call yourself, if you identify as a believer

635
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,640
 in Christ, we have this foundation of forgiveness

636
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,720
 that should always be somewhere in our consciousness.

637
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,840
 And experiencing the life of people who don't know Jesus,

638
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,360
 I realized, wow, sometimes they do not.

639
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,800
 Now, if this is why we should forgive

640
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,280
 and what happens when we forgive,

641
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,120
 how do we actually do this?

642
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,560
 What does it even look like?

643
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,960
 Now, remember the definition is that there's both

644
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,200
 an internal addressing of the situation,

645
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,360
 but there's also an external change as well.

646
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,440
 So taking the definitions that I shared earlier,

647
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,240
 here are some steps for forgiveness.

648
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,920
 And if any of you are therapists or have been to therapy,

649
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,000
 you'll recognize these steps.

650
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,080
 First is you need to choose to act.

651
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,120
 Going to therapy and dealing with forgiveness,

652
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,640
 you need to do something.

653
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,640
 I cannot reach into your heart and make you forgive someone.

654
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,820
 You have to do that, right?

655
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,240
 You cannot sit there and say, "Well, make me."

656
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,120
 It doesn't work like that, right?

657
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,920
 So forgiveness needs to first and foremost

658
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,060
 be a decision that you make.

659
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:49,680
 Then, whatever it looks like,

660
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,600
 whether you're talking to someone

661
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,200
 or you're actually going to therapy itself,

662
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,080
 be willing to abandon your rights to that as resentment.

663
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,640
 What that means is you have to choose to address the issues.

664
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,520
 I have literally been in coaching

665
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,600
 and in pastoral counseling situations

666
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,760
 where the person in front of me was forced to be there.

667
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,500
 Either it was a child, like their parents made them,

668
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,480
 or their spouse or significant other made them.

669
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,840
 And they're sitting there and they refuse to talk about

670
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,320
 what they really need to talk about.

671
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,200
 It is the most frustrating thing I'm doing

672
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,840
 when somebody is forced and they don't talk

673
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,800
 and I'm like, "Buddy, it's been 50 minutes.

674
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,080
 "What are we talking about?"

675
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,680
 That is not how I coach, by the way.

676
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,320
 That's just my internal mind.

677
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,300
 I feel like I'm confessing a lot here.

678
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,120
 But if you're going to act on forgiveness,

679
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,100
 you need to be willing to go there.

680
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,960
 And that's hard, I understand that.

681
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,080
 But you need to be willing to address that resentment

682
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,880
 and start that process of abandoning your rights

683
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,780
 to that resentment.

684
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,620
 And you know what?

685
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,080
 If you've ever been to therapy,

686
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,380
 you know it is not a one-time thing.

687
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,260
 It is a constant, repeated thing.

688
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,100
 Why?

689
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,040
 Because you go one week, you peel back a layer,

690
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,500
 ho, there's another one, oh, there's two more.

691
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,160
 And you just keep going and then you're like,

692
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,920
 "What are we talking about?"

693
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,960
 Jeepers, we're covering everything because it goes deep.

694
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,860
 So it's a repeated process.

695
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,280
 But it isn't just not feeling anger or resentment.

696
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,160
 It's, remember, it's fostering something else.

697
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,200
 It's transforming into something else.

698
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,040
 And I love this phrase by Enright and Fitzgibbons

699
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,040
 that it is fostering the undeserved qualities of compassion.

700
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:38,000
 People who have hurt you,

701
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,320
 they may never deserve your grace and forgiveness.

702
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
 Full stop.

703
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,020
 But forgiveness is a choice that you make

704
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,420
 in light of that situation.

705
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:58,460
 So you foster the undeserved qualities of compassion,

706
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,240
 generosity, and according to Enright and Fitzgibbon,

707
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,720
 maybe even love.

708
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,720
 And again, it's not a one-time thing.

709
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,680
 It's rinse and repeat.

710
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,280
 Keep doing it.

711
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,040
 Until, remember, this is the outcome,

712
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,920
 that you are no longer dominated by resentment.

713
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,720
 Now, as I say this repeatedly,

714
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,880
 I know some of you right now are looking at me

715
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,380
 and you are honestly dominated by resentment.

716
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,640
 And as I am speaking, I am inviting the Holy Spirit

717
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,720
 to just knock on your heart.

718
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,100
 And the question is, maybe it's time.

719
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,280
 So this is the clinical process of forgiveness.

720
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,600
 This is what happens when you go see a therapist.

721
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,800
 Of course, it's different ways,

722
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,960
 but this is how I was brought through forgiveness.

723
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,760
 But let me give you a scriptural one.

724
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,060
 Let me give you a scriptural how to forgive.

725
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,240
 And I was introduced to this translation.

726
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,900
 It's called the Passion Translation.

727
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,160
 It's a paraphrase, kind of like how the message was.

728
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,880
 So it's called the TPT.

729
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,340
 So in the TPT, let me read you Proverbs 20, verse 22.

730
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,760
 Don't ever say, "I'm going to get even with them

731
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,400
 "if it's the last thing I do."

732
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,520
 That's revenge.

733
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,340
 Don't do that.

734
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,840
 Wrap God's grace around your heart,

735
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,900
 and he will be the one to vindicate you.

736
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,040
 Wrap God's grace around your heart.

737
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,900
 Your heart may be broken, battered.

738
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,060
 You may have been abused.

739
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,220
 You may have, you may even struggle

740
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,620
 to get up in the mornings

741
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,260
 because of the pain that you have suffered.

742
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,840
 How do you forgive?

743
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,100
 You allow the grace of God to surround your heart,

744
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,900
 and then you let God vindicate you.

745
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:56,500
 This is not something you can do easily.

746
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,220
 But thankfully, as we learned from last week's

747
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,820
 Talk by Promise, we don't do this in our own strength.

748
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,220
 We do this by the grace and the power

749
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,220
 and the love and the mercy of the presence

750
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,900
 of the Holy Spirit.

751
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,220
 Let him wrap his grace around your heart,

752
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,500
 and then let him vindicate you.

753
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:25,380
 So if it's so powerful,

754
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,660
 if that's what we do scripturally,

755
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,940
 if that's what we do physically,

756
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,860
 what are we supposed to do with this?

757
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,980
 What now?

758
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,820
 Am I supposed to forgive in every situation?

759
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,860
 Am I supposed to just say, "Oh, I forgive you.

760
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,820
 "You can do whatever you want to me

761
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,900
 "because I'm gonna forgive you."

762
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:46,500
 Let me say this, and I cannot say this any stronger.

763
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,140
 If you are currently in a situation of abuse,

764
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,900
 physical, sexual, emotional, psychological abuse,

765
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,260
 get out.

766
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,700
 Talk to somebody.

767
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,460
 To live a life of forgiveness

768
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,380
 doesn't mean you have to accept abuse.

769
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,720
 Get safe, get out, talk to someone.

770
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,420
 If you don't trust a family member,

771
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,500
 go and talk to a friend.

772
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
 If you don't trust friends,

773
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,420
 go and talk to some of the pastoral team.

774
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,940
 If you don't trust them, go and talk to a counselor,

775
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,580
 but do not accept the abuse that's happening.

776
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,980
 I'm personally a mandatory reporter.

777
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,100
 If I see or hear about anything

778
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,780
 in the realm of physical or sexual abuse,

779
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,500
 I am mandated to report it directly to the police.

780
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,780
 Now, I don't know about that in Hong,

781
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,300
 I don't know what the laws are in Hong Kong,

782
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,420
 but that's what I practice,

783
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,820
 and I know there's nuance here,

784
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,380
 but do not accept abuse

785
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,700
 just because you think that's the Christian way.

786
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
 Get help, get out, and get safe.

787
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,560
 In fact, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you

788
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,700
 the QR code for Oasis Counseling Center.

789
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,780
 This is the counseling center

790
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,780
 that's attached to the Vine Church.

791
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,900
 Now, if those of you who need it,

792
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,740
 I wanna ask you to do it,

793
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,260
 but to protect the identity of those

794
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,420
 who genuinely need to reach out,

795
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,700
 I'm gonna ask all of you to take out your phones

796
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,820
 and just at least do the act of it

797
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,620
 so that someone who really needs it

798
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,860
 is not feeling like, oh, everybody's looking at me.

799
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,080
 Obviously, I need help,

800
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,380
 so let's all do it.

801
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,600
 Now, some of you who are laughing and doing this,

802
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,980
 you need to go!

803
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,580
 (audience laughing)

804
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,300
 So let's just protect those who really need it,

805
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,220
 but if any of you need to get out

806
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,540
 and you don't know what to do,

807
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,260
 please contact our counseling team.

808
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,340
 They would love to,

809
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,900
 all of our trained professional counselors

810
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,200
 would love to talk to you.

811
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,700
 But let's say you're clear of the abuse.

812
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,260
 Maybe it happened a while ago,

813
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,860
 weeks, months, years, maybe even decades,

814
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,740
 but that phrase, dominated by resentment, still stands.

815
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,480
 Maybe when you think of what happened to you

816
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,940
 or what was done to you,

817
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,640
 you still have rage or anger or pain

818
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,700
 or you want vengeance or,

819
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,600
 it's just uncontrollable, a negative response.

820
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,360
 And I bet you some of you are looking at me

821
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
 and intently you're saying,

822
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,320
 "You don't know how hard it was.

823
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,860
 "You don't know how painful it was.

824
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:02,400
 "You don't know what I've been through, Derek."

825
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,120
 And you're right, I'll never know,

826
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,320
 but Jesus does.

827
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,780
 Jesus knows every single thing that has happened.

828
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:23,240
 And you can say to me, "Oh, well, why wasn't he there?

829
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,040
 "Why did he allow this to happen?"

830
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,120
 I will never be able to explain that to you

831
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,480
 and I'm not even gonna try.

832
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,280
 But I wanna tell you that Jesus understands your pain.

833
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,960
 The perfect, sinless Son of God came to earth

834
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,100
 to experience life on earth to its fullness.

835
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,120
 And near the end of his life,

836
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,120
 he was accused of being a blasphemer,

837
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,080
 tortured, stripped down, humiliated,

838
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,020
 forced to wear a crown of thorns,

839
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,280
 paraded through the city

840
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,780
 for nothing of his wrongdoing of his own,

841
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:11,120
 but because he went to take yours and my sin.

842
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,320
 You think Jesus doesn't understand betrayal?

843
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,860
 You think Jesus doesn't understand pain and suffering?

844
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,820
 He absolutely understands it.

845
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:29,080
 Luke 23, "And when they came to the place

846
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,800
 "that's called Skull, there they crucified him,"

847
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,000
 being Jesus, "with the criminals."

848
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,560
 They treated him, our Savior, as a criminal

849
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,680
 because of my sin.

850
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,840
 And they hung him there,

851
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,000
 bleeding, alone.

852
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 And what does he say?

853
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,160
 He said, "Father, forgive them,

854
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,800
 "for they know not what they do."

855
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,840
 (chuckles)

856
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,840
 Our Savior, in the midst of being betrayed

857
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,560
 by the very people he came to save,

858
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,160
 he says, "Forgive them."

859
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,580
 This is our God.

860
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:22,680
 See, forgiveness is the central core aspect of our faith.

861
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,360
 There's no justification.

862
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,400
 There's no sanctification.

863
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,720
 There's no nothing without forgiveness.

864
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,240
 We don't have a faith.

865
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,540
 We don't have a Savior without forgiveness.

866
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,040
 And so the only way we can experience the true fullness

867
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,640
 of what God has for us is that we receive that forgiveness

868
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,040
 and then we extend it to others.

869
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 Because if we don't, who are we to say,

870
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,080
 we receive all that forgiveness, and then we say,

871
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,480
 "No, I'm not gonna forgive others."

872
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,200
 Then we become a block to the love

873
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,760
 and the power of forgiveness in this world

874
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,960
 because we hoard it for ourselves.

875
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,720
 Or we don't think Jesus has the power to forgive,

876
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,560
 which both is not true.

877
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,740
 Is forgiveness easy?

878
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,520
 No, it's absolutely not.

879
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,480
 But thankfully, we have the person of Jesus

880
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,240
 in the presence of the Holy Spirit.

881
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,040
 I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

882
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,180
 I'm going to ask the Holy Spirit to do that.

883
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,140
 I'm gonna share one last story.

884
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,040
 Can I get the pen?

885
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,960
 I grew up in a Chinese family.

886
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,460
 My parents are from Hong Kong.

887
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,280
 And my dad immigrated to the States,

888
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,780
 had a great upbringing there.

889
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,940
 And then we came back to Hong Kong

890
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,780
 and I lived the expat life.

891
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,820
 I went to island school,

892
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,220
 if there's anyone who went to island school.

893
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,940
 I went to, you know, I was able to have all the things,

894
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,540
 you know, tennis club, golf club, woo-hoo.

895
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,500
 I lived the life, right?

896
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,840
 I even went to university in the States.

897
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,820
 So my father being a very Chinese man,

898
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,820
 loved us in the way that Chinese men do.

899
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,700
 He provided for us, right?

900
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,340
 Did I have a relationship with my father?

901
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,380
 No.

902
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,620
 Did I sit down and talk to my dad

903
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,760
 about all my hopes and dreams?

904
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,600
 No.

905
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,080
 Did I sit there and just ask him how his day was?

906
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,040
 No, that's not the relationship that I have with my father.

907
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,080
 In the late stages of his life,

908
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,160
 he had severe dementia

909
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,080
 and a number of other ailments with his body,

910
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,740
 but then he developed a cancer in his jawbone.

911
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,120
 And because his overall health was so poor,

912
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,760
 the doctors said, "We cannot operate on him.

913
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,560
 "He won't survive the operation."

914
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,840
 So essentially they said, "There's nothing we can do."

915
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,720
 So we just tried in the later stages of his life

916
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,360
 to have his quality of life as positive as it could be.

917
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,040
 But the cancer grew to a point

918
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,760
 where it fused his mouth shut.

919
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,780
 So he could no longer chew.

920
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,120
 And if there was one thing that my father loved doing,

921
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,960
 it was eating.

922
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,320
 He was diabetic, but he loved his ice creams

923
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,160
 and he loved fatty char siu.

924
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,680
 It was just ridiculous.

925
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,880
 But once he could no longer take solid food,

926
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,860
 he just disintegrated.

927
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,320
 And so we're very thankful that he didn't suffer very long,

928
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,420
 but ultimately he succumbed to the cancer.

929
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,760
 A few hours after he passed,

930
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,440
 I was outside in the hospital,

931
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,080
 outside the operating room,

932
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,680
 and I was able to go and say my farewell to my father,

933
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,880
 just a few hours passed.

934
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,720
 I stood there

935
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,060
 and I said, "Dad, thank you so much for the life

936
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,400
 "that you provided for me."

937
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,640
 Then I found myself saying,

938
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,500
 "You know, Dad, I forgive you for not being the father

939
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,460
 "I wish you were."

940
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,380
 And I would love to tell you

941
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,760
 that I had this wave of emotion, of tears of joy,

942
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,800
 and this just release, but I didn't.

943
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,840
 You know what I felt?

944
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,020
 Shame.

945
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,680
 I don't have very many regrets in my life,

946
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,520
 but I felt in that moment, shame.

947
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,200
 Because why didn't I care enough

948
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,800
 to say this to my father when he was of sound mind

949
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,920
 and of sound health,

950
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,560
 so that we could actually build the relationship

951
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,560
 that I wish we had?

952
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,280
 So what I'm saying is when it comes to forgiveness,

953
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,560
 don't be like me.

954
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,800
 Don't wait.

955
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,300
 'Cause then you don't know if you have the chance.

956
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,340
 Why don't we all stand here today?

957
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:49,520
 Maybe if you could just close your eyes.

958
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,360
 (gentle music)

959
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,160
 Heavenly Father, I thank you for every single person

960
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,800
 here in this room and everyone online who's watching.

961
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,040
 I don't know their story.

962
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,240
 I don't know their pain.

963
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,420
 I don't know where they're at, but you do.

964
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:11,400
 So Father, I ask right now by the power and mercy

965
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,820
 and grace of your Holy Spirit,

966
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,780
 come and minister to your people now.

967
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,560
 It is not in our strength that we can do this,

968
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,960
 but wrap your grace around our hearts

969
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,540
 and help us to be conjurants of forgiveness.

970
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:35,240
 No matter how painful or difficult it is,

971
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,840
 Jesus, you promise that you are with us.

972
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,520
 So guide us now, minister to us,

973
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,080
 and we thank you in Jesus' name, amen.

974
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,660
 (gentle music)

975
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,240
 (gentle music)
