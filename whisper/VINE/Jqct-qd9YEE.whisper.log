[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.520]   Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.200]   We are a staff that loves to smile indeed.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.120]   So Carla's always got a smile on her face.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.660]   Even through the most stressful times,
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.800]   you'll never see Carla without a smile on her face.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.080]   Isn't that right, Richard?
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.920]   Yes?
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   Yeah, okay, yeah.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.000]   Good answer.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.120]   All right, well, good morning, y'all.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.440]   Here and online.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.280]   How y'all doing today?
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.560]   Good, okay, you'll have to excuse me a little bit.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.200]   I just returned to Hong Kong after spending some time
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.320]   in Texas with my wife's family.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.400]   So if I start throwing out words like y'all
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.080]   and fixin' to and howdy, you know,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.160]   I'm not having a stroke, I'm not having an identity crisis,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160]   just readjusting to Hong Kong, okay?
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.800]   Any Texans in the house today, by the way?
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.640]   Anyone from Texas?
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.720]   No, all right, all right, all right.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.420]   Okay, just me, okay.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.800]   Well, our son, Isaiah, I just had to,
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.200]   Isaiah, that is his name, yes?
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.480]   Isaiah is turning two in a few weeks.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.280]   And watching him grow has been the most lovely
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880]   yet frustrating journey we've been on together
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.720]   as a family so far.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.760]   Of course, there are many challenges.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000]   And one of the challenges we're facing this time
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.740]   is teaching him impulse control,
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.560]   which at the moment seems pretty,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.400]   you know, it doesn't exist for him, basically.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400]   He just does whatever he wants, whenever he wants.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.760]   This might be screaming at the top of his lungs
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   for no reason.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.000]   This might be, you know, throwing food across the table.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800]   This might be licking things that he shouldn't be licking,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.640]   like the MTR pole that everybody has their hands on, okay?
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.600]   I'm told, this is, the internet tells me,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.760]   so it must be true, right?
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.940]   This is a very common stage for toddlers to go through.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.560]   In fact, there's a very famous social experiment
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.000]   that highlights this thing about children
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.880]   and impulse control.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.940]   It's called the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.280]   Some of you might be familiar with it.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.320]   You might have seen the YouTube video on it.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.680]   Basically what happens is there's a small child in a room
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.760]   and an adult walks in and gives this child a marshmallow.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.160]   And he or she is told, hey, here's one marshmallow.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.040]   If you wait till I come back, you know, don't eat it.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.360]   If you wait till I come back and the marshmallow's still here
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.500]   I'm gonna bring you another one.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.380]   So you'll have two.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.200]   And so the adult leaves the room and they wait.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.940]   And the camera's on the child.
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.040]   And you just see this child go through the next,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.000]   you know, two minutes,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.840]   the most excruciating time of their lives, right?
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.760]   They're sitting there staring at the marshmallow.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.520]   You know, they're like prodding it, sniffing it,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.920]   you know, trying to lick it.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.760]   And some of them pinch a little bit off, you know,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.600]   the temptation to eat it is just so much.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.200]   And of course, some children just don't care.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.280]   The temptation's too much.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.680]   You just pick it up, eat it.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.400]   It's like, I'm not even sorry about that, you know?
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.920]   So impulse control, resisting temptation.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   Now, this might sound fun to us.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.860]   Been in our own walk, in our own lives.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.760]   We too go through our own versions
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.600]   of battles with temptation.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   And I'm sure every one of us in this room
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.040]   knows what it feels like to really, really,
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.420]   really want to do the things,
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.460]   but we know they violate how God has called us to live.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.760]   We can define temptation this way.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.560]   Temptation can be defined as the inclination to sin.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.840]   The pull to do and think and act in ways
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.180]   that we know we're not supposed to.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.040]   And these things can be very seductive.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.600]   They're seductive because on the surface,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.160]   they seem to enhance our lives.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.700]   They seem to make life better or easier or more free.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.600]   But in the end, what we find is that
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.320]   when we give into temptation,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.920]   what it actually does is diminish
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.900]   and maybe even tear down or destroy the genuine life
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.740]   that God has called us to live.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.800]   The life that God truly has for us.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.460]   Okay, don't switch off.
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.300]   It might start to get a little uncomfortable,
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.320]   but stay with me.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.300]   We all know what we're talking about, right?
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.240]   That website that's just one click away.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.020]   The pull to objectify another person
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.500]   in a purely physical, sexual way.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.020]   The swipe of that credit card,
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.940]   well, that thing you just need so much,
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.220]   but you already don't know how you're gonna pay the bill
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.220]   from the next month.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.100]   That really snarky comment that you know if you say it,
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.380]   it's just cut the person right down to it,
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.620]   put them in their place.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.740]   That angry outburst you just unleash on your child
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.040]   without thinking about it.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.380]   You're out on the night.
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.120]   Just one more drink, just one more drink.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.580]   The ease it would be to just to take that little bit extra,
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.460]   no one's ever gonna know.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.180]   If I take this, no one's ever gonna know.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.020]   So, you know, it's fine, right?
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.420]   Or that relationship you keep going back to,
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.660]   which you know is so toxic,
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.600]   but for some reason you just feel like
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.660]   you have to keep going back there.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.640]   Hashtag my life, am I right?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.400]   Now, of course, for some of these things,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.220]   the consequence of giving into temptation
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.380]   might not be so serious.
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.940]   Like licking empty your hand rails,
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.020]   yeah, it's a bit gross, you might get a bit sick,
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.540]   you might end up on YouTube even,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.220]   but in the long run, it's okay.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.480]   Screaming in a restaurant for no reason,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.660]   it's a bit embarrassing, but people will get over it.
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.780]   Eating a lot of marshmallows, well, technically,
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.680]   I don't think that's even really wrong in the first place.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.420]   But for some things,
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.940]   like the things we have just listed above,
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.280]   the consequence of not getting a handle
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.240]   can be pretty serious, are pretty serious.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.080]   And so today, as we continue in the book of James,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.960]   we come to a couple of passages that teach us
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.080]   how to stay strong in temptation.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.340]   And I'm not joking when I say our lives
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.840]   might literally depend on how we handle
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.180]   these things in our lives.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.240]   So you're still paying attention?
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.800]   Okay, good.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.440]   Let's get into it then.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.940]   James 1, 13, follow me if you can, please.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.400]   Scripture says this,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.040]   "When tempted, no one should say, 'God is tempting me.'
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.480]   For God cannot be tempted by evil,
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.460]   nor does he tempt anyone.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.820]   But each person is tempted when they are dragged away
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.840]   by their own evil desire and enticed.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.600]   Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.060]   and sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death."
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.580]   You know, there's a funny thing that happens in languages
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.660]   where sometimes words can sound the same,
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.360]   but have completely different meanings.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.720]   Right, this happens in Cantonese.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.680]   You know, you have something called tong yim chi, right?
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.440]   Which they sound the same,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.360]   but the meaning is completely different.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.640]   So for example, mou hei, right?
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.040]   In Cantonese, there's a phrase called mou hei.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.760]   Mou hei can mean, "I'm out of breath, I'm tired,
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.280]   I need to take a break."
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.080]   Or mou hei can also mean,
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.640]   "A weapon that you use to fight or attack someone with."
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.480]   Right?
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.200]   Sounds the same, different meaning.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.900]   In English, we have these words too, right?
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.240]   They are called homonyms.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.720]   Is that right, English teachers?
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.160]   Right, homonyms.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.200]   Sound the same, completely different meaning.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.880]   For example, the word bark, okay?
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.960]   Bark can be the sound a dog makes when it's excited
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.520]   or trying to get your attention.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.360]   Or it can be like the outer layer of a tree, right?
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.160]   Same sound, different meaning.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.520]   Rock, for example, right?
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.360]   Can be chunks of granite or stone
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.160]   that you see lying around on the ground.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.240]   Or it could be a Hollywood movie superstar.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   Same word, different meaning.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.280]   Now I'm telling you this
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.360]   because there is a homonym happening here
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.640]   in this passage in the Greek.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.920]   The word is perissamos.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   And it's a word that can mean both trials and temptations.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.460]   Now last week, Pastor Carla talked to us about trials,
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.560]   right, about how trials can be something
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.760]   that we learn to take joy in.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.360]   Can even be seen as a gift from God.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.520]   Why is that?
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.040]   Well, because trials can be used to refine us,
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   shape us, build us up so we can be,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.480]   in the word of James himself, lacking in nothing.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.500]   Trials can be a good thing if we embrace them
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.520]   in the way that we're supposed to.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.800]   In fact, scripture reassures us that time and time again,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.720]   God can and use trials in our lives
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.920]   to make us to be more like Jesus.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.580]   For our own good, for the good of the community,
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.720]   and for the glorification of his name.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.240]   And yes, they are tough and challenging to get through,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.680]   but trials are a journey well worth taking.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.760]   However, temptation is very different.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.460]   Because temptation does not seek to glorify God
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.420]   or to build up his name.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.760]   But temptation seeks to tear us down,
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.280]   to destroy us, to shame us,
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.700]   and ultimately to lead us into death.
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.680]   The point we need to understand is this,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.620]   where trials and tests may come from God,
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.920]   the temptation to sin will never come from God.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.960]   God never entices us to sin against him.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.280]   It's not in his nature, it's not in his personality,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.200]   it's just not the way he works.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.280]   I say this is important for us to understand,
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.360]   because in order for us to get a handle on temptation,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.640]   we need to know God's character.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.840]   'Cause often what I find for myself at least is this,
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.600]   when I fall into temptation, I start to blame God
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.500]   for the place that I've put myself in.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.520]   In fact, if we look to the very beginning of time,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.520]   when we see how sin enters into this world,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.400]   we see Adam and Eve blaming God.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.680]   Adam and Eve are tempted to eat the tree,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.720]   from the only tree that God told them,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.100]   "Do not eat fruit from this tree, it's off limits."
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.080]   And they take fruit from that tree.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.040]   And when God comes to the Garden of Eden
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.280]   and he confronts Adam about it,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.760]   notice his reaction, Adam says this,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.160]   "Well, it's the woman you put with me,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.440]   "she gave me some of the fruit, and that's why I ate it."
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.720]   And then God asked Eve what happened,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.300]   and Eve defects blame and she says,
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.680]   "Well, the serpent deceived me, that's why I ate the fruit."
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.320]   In other words, what Adam and Eve are saying,
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.400]   "You know what God, it's not our fault,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.900]   "this is on you God, it's your fault.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.080]   "If it wasn't for this woman,
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.440]   "if it wasn't for this serpent,
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.520]   "we would never be in the place that we are now."
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.840]   Like I said, how about in your own life?
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.180]   Do we ever find ourselves blaming God for our own mistakes?
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.640]   Remember what we just said,
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.520]   God will never entice us to sin,
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.460]   because God can have nothing to do with evil.
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.720]   Let's go back to verse 13 for a minute, okay?
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.320]   I think if we look at the verse this way,
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.720]   it's gonna highlight it quite well.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.240]   We're gonna read it again,
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.800]   but this time notice the homonym, okay?
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.900]   It's been phrased in a slightly different way
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.840]   with this homonym in mind.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.260]   Verse 13 reads like this,
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.820]   "When tested, no one should say God is tempting me,
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.400]   "for God cannot be tempted by evil,
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.680]   "nor does he tempt anyone."
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.280]   So I'll say it again, just to drive it home.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.080]   God does not tempt anyone to sin.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.160]   He is only good all the time,
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.240]   and for that reason, we can put our trust fully in Him.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.900]   One more point before we carry on, okay?
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.120]   When I'm talking about temptation here,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.240]   we have to understand that temptation itself is not sin.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.040]   It's the giving into temptation, crossing that line,
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.900]   that's when it becomes sin.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.160]   Right, after all, scripture tells us
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.240]   that Jesus was tempted in every single way,
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.180]   just as we are, yet he did not sin.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.740]   That's Hebrews 4:15.
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.320]   So the question then becomes this,
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.380]   well, where does the temptation to sin come from?
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:25.520]   Verse 14, "But each person is tempted
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.040]   "when they are dragged away
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.440]   "by their own evil desire and enticed."
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.680]   So there's a small list here
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.540]   that tells us the sources of temptation.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.380]   First, it says this, "Our own evil desire."
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.880]   Again, this is one of these uncomfortable truths
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.040]   that we have to embrace.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.920]   And the fact is, all of us in this room,
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.320]   all of you guys watching online,
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.660]   all of us, no matter who you are,
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.600]   are capable of doing evil.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.960]   And in this passage, James is trying to remind us
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.600]   that there is a sense of responsibility we have to take.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.980]   He's really trying to stress that here.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.520]   When we make a mess of things, when we mess things up,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.120]   when we fall into sin through temptation,
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.780]   we have to own up to it.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.840]   That's on us.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.880]   Now, of course, this isn't saying
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.240]   that we only do evil all the time.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.960]   Later in the letter, James is encouraging the readers
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.520]   and the hearers to pair the faith and the works together
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.280]   in order to do good things, to glorify God's name,
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.960]   to reach the community, to help other people,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.620]   like widows and the orphans.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.400]   But this is a reminder to us that as human beings,
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.160]   which I'm sure most of us in this room are,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.240]   evil is a reality that sits within all of us.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.080]   Now, you might be thinking again, evil, really?
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.240]   That's kind of a harsh word to use, isn't it?
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.800]   I mean, I know I do bad things, but is it really evil?
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.820]   Again, let's expand our thinking a little bit
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.600]   because the way evil is being used here isn't to,
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.080]   isn't like maybe in our imagination
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.720]   or the really evil things that come up to our mind.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.860]   But evil is used to describe anything
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.360]   that falls short of God's standard.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.280]   Our selfish desires, our greed, our lust, dishonesty,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.400]   fits of rage and anger, neglecting the poor and the needy.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.520]   All of us in this room are capable of evil acts,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.320]   both big and small.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.000]   And when we fall into those places,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   we have to take responsibility of our own sin.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.920]   So there is our own evil desires.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.160]   However, there are also temptations
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.000]   that come to us from other sources.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.360]   This is what James is talking about
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.720]   when it says we are dragged away and enticed.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.160]   And the fact is we have a very evil enemy,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.480]   a very real enemy, Satan and his minions
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.820]   and all the other devils that work for him
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.180]   who will do whatever they can to entice you
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.140]   to give into your own temptation.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.240]   There are also people with bad intentions,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.720]   people who don't necessarily have your best for you.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.080]   These are people that might try to use you,
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.520]   try to abuse you, different ways to try and trick
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.760]   and manipulate you into doing things you know aren't right.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   And when James uses the words dragged away and enticed,
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.440]   the original hearers and the original readers
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.880]   of this letter would have immediately come up
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.080]   with images of things like traps and hooks
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.840]   that were used for like fishing and hunting
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.160]   to hunt and catch animals.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.880]   So maybe as a bit of reflection, we can ask it like this.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.540]   Do you ever find yourselves being preyed upon by evil?
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.360]   I mean, you're out there trying
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.760]   to live your best life for Jesus,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.380]   but it seems like these temptations,
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.920]   these things just keep trying to trip you up,
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.840]   things trying to hunt you down
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.900]   and put evil thoughts and desires into your mind.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:12.120]   For example, maybe just an example, right?
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.920]   You've just really had a wonderful time with God
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.840]   with your small group.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.920]   Maybe you went out to do some outreach and it was amazing.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.240]   You sat down with a stranger
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.560]   and you shared your life with them.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.920]   And it was just a really good time of worshiping God together
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.480]   seeing him at work in the life of your small group
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.540]   and your community.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.220]   People were deeply impacted by God this evening
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.140]   and it was great.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.260]   But now you come home and it's quiet.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.380]   Maybe you're alone.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.940]   Maybe the family's already asleep.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.540]   And suddenly it's as if, you know,
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.420]   these things just start happening in your brain,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.660]   all these hooks, all these temptations.
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.020]   Turn on the computer, do this, do that.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.500]   Check it out, nobody's gonna know.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.740]   You had a tough night, you had a tiring day,
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.300]   you need to relax.
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.020]   Now, of course, the context might be slightly different
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.900]   from everyone here.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.020]   But I think with a little bit of self-reflection
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.940]   and honesty, we know how this works in our own lives.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.020]   Right, we get those urges.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.780]   We get hooked, we get trapped.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.700]   And even though we know we're not supposed to go there,
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.260]   suddenly we find ourselves right back in the middle
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.660]   of the mess we saw we left behind that last time.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.900]   It's like what Paul says in his letter to the Romans.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.980]   Romans 7, 19.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.580]   "For I do not do the good I want to do,
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.580]   "but the evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.340]   "Now, if I do not," sorry,
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.540]   "if I do what I do not want to do,
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.740]   "it is no longer I who do it,
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.300]   "but it is sin living in me that does it."
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.620]   Well, how do we respond when things like this happen to us?
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.020]   When we go through this rollercoaster,
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.540]   what's the right response?
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.460]   Well, one of the dangers is for us to play down
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.020]   the seriousness of sin and temptation.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.020]   You know, the concept of temptation,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.380]   especially it's something often gets trivialized, right?
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.940]   In media, in the things we see around us,
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.780]   it gets trivialized.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.300]   We make it into this thing where it seems kind of fun,
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.660]   or we can float around with temptation a little bit.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.980]   It's okay, it's fun and exciting.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.620]   Let's see how far I can go,
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.780]   how far I can get away with this.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.420]   And we begin telling ourselves a lie.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.180]   We begin telling ourselves things like,
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.060]   "It's not so bad,
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.940]   "because it's not really hurting anybody,
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.820]   "so why not go there?"
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:40.420]   Church, this is a lie.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.860]   And in fact, James gives us a pretty graphic picture
[00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.420]   of what happens when we follow that path,
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.940]   when we give into temptation and let sin run our lives.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.860]   Listen carefully.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.140]   After desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.140]   And sin, when it is full grown, gives birth to death.
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.300]   I mean, it sounds like something out of a horror movie,
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.900]   right, at least in my imagination,
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.420]   this is the kind of picture that comes up.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.940]   But the reason why James is using such vivid
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.660]   and graphic language is that he's trying to highlight
[00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.860]   that temptation is not something
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.620]   that we can just mess around with.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.140]   As we mentioned earlier,
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.100]   the consequences of giving into temptation
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   is a very serious thing.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.220]   And when we allow temptation to grow and develop,
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.580]   it tells us it turns into sin,
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.740]   and sin leads to one place only, and that is death.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:43.460]   The word used here by James is conceived,
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.740]   and he uses it to evoke the picture of pregnancy.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.700]   But James uses it somewhat ironically
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.940]   because in a normal, healthy conception and birth,
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.260]   right, in a normal, healthy circumstance,
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.620]   birth leads to joy and new life.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.700]   I mean, I will never know how hard it is
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:05.820]   for a woman to carry a child in the womb for nine months,
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.460]   that whole journey, it's tiring, it's tough.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.340]   But what I do know is that at the end of that,
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.180]   there is great joy in celebrating new life.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.460]   But in this case, there is nothing good
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.740]   that comes from giving birth.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.500]   Because in this case, we are giving birth to sin.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.620]   And as it says in Scripture,
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.260]   sin, when it is full grown, gives birth or leads to death.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.620]   Again, listen, church, it's important to remember
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.020]   because like we said, there are times
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.060]   when we feel like we can just walk in temptation
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.060]   and get away with it.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.140]   It doesn't hurt anyone, we're thinking.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.180]   It's not gonna be a big deal.
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.140]   Or we try and justify it by saying things like,
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.240]   you know, if you only knew the stress that I'm facing,
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.100]   if you only knew the pressures that I'm up against,
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.940]   you would understand why I have to turn to these things.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.940]   But the path is clear.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.640]   When we succumb to our temptations, it leads to sin.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.580]   And sin, when it grows up,
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.260]   Romans 6, 23 says it in a different way,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.920]   same message though.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.820]   The wages of the consequence of sin is death.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.660]   So put it in a very simple diagram.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.500]   It might look a bit like this.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.980]   Temptation leads to our own evil desires.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.820]   We fall into sin, which leads to death.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:36.060]   Now, when we focus on the word death,
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.940]   again, it seems kind of harsh.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.020]   I mean, it's like one of these Bible verses, right?
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.860]   That Christians use to bash other people,
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.000]   to scare people to believing in Jesus.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.200]   And besides, it's not even true, is it?
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.640]   Because I know a lot of people
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.280]   who don't seem to worry about sin or temptation.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.820]   They just do whatever they want to do
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.960]   whenever they want to do it.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.220]   And life seems to be fine for them.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.460]   They don't seem to be dying.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.660]   In fact, it seems like they're having a great time with life.
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.820]   So it's important, again, to understand what James means
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.880]   when he uses the word death.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.520]   It's not so much a literal physical death,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.840]   although I think we can all imagine scenarios
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.140]   where giving into temptation will literally lead you
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.940]   to an actual physical death.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.180]   But I think the bigger meaning,
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.560]   if we expand the definition a little bit,
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.400]   death, what James is talking about,
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.160]   is a life separated from God's truth.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.840]   Death is a life separated from the fullness
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.900]   that Jesus promises his believers,
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.020]   which is why he reminds us, verse 16,
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.760]   "Do not be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters."
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   Do not be deceived.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.200]   Because yes, on the surface,
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.880]   it might seem as though people living that way,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.300]   it's good, it's fine.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.860]   It might appear as though those who live
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.220]   without any worry about sin and temptation ever,
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.260]   all figured out, they do whatever they want to do,
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.300]   follow their own desires, that's the way to live your life.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.100]   Again, just being honest in a moment of reflection here.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.940]   I've often thought this to myself.
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.200]   I wonder if you have too.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.320]   Sometimes I feel like life would be so much easier
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.520]   if I wasn't a Christian.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.580]   I think for me, this is one of the biggest temptations.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.220]   I see how people live,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.960]   and I see when people don't seem to care
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.860]   about resisting temptation or doing the wrong thing,
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.500]   it looks really good.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.540]   It's very tempting for me.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.780]   They just do whatever they want, whenever they want,
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.260]   and it always looks fun.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.140]   And I sometimes find myself looking with envy and jealousy.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.300]   I begin to ask God questions like, "Come on, Jesus.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.440]   "How come I had to be called into ministry?
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.780]   "Why do I have to care so much
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.960]   "about what you think and feel and say?
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.280]   "Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?"
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.560]   How about you?
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.560]   Where have you been deceived?
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.400]   Where have you ever felt like giving into temptation
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.300]   is better than a life with Jesus?
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:25.800]   Brothers and sisters, do not be deceived.
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.040]   Temptation and sin lead to one place only,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.840]   and that is death.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.920]   Because all these enticing things we see before us right now,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.580]   one day, they're not gonna exist anymore.
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.860]   It's like flowers that fade.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.360]   It's like a vapor in the wind.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   One day, these things will not exist.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.160]   And in the end, that only thing that will remain
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.200]   is the truth of God's Word and His love for us.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.700]   And so therefore, when we live outside of that truth
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.240]   and that love, that is death.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.940]   And yes, it might not literally kill you
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.540]   right there on the spot,
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.320]   but it does mean that you will be living a life
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.220]   less than the genuine full version of God,
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.420]   of who God created you to be.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.360]   Remember what Jesus said in John 10, 10.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.800]   "The thief, the enemy, sin comes to steal,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.160]   "kill, and destroy.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.660]   "But I have come that they, that y'all,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.740]   "might have life and have it to the full."
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.640]   So what do we do?
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.440]   Is there something to help us
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.580]   out this road of self-destruction?
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.620]   Well, good news is yes.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.220]   Because remember what we said earlier?
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.020]   It's not in God's nature for Him to entice us to sin.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.560]   It's not in His nature to lead us into temptation.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.960]   God will never ask you to sin.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.900]   But rather, this is what God does do for us.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.040]   Verse 17, James 1.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.400]   "Every good and perfect gift is from above,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.300]   "coming down from the Father of heavenly light,
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.940]   "who does not change like shifting shadows.
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:10.280]   "He chose to give us birth through the word of truth,
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.780]   "that we might be a kind of first fruits of all He created."
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.680]   So this is the truth then.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.620]   The God we serve is good and He is perfect.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.920]   Everything that comes from God is good and perfect.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.760]   And when sin and temptation shifts and changes
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.860]   and hides in the dark, God is light.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.500]   And God is unchanging, which means God is trustworthy.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.200]   But notice something really cool here, Will.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.600]   This is some of the coolest parts that I noticed.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.940]   Remember just now when James was talking about
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.740]   how sin leads to temptation,
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.680]   which leads to gives birth to death.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.880]   He was using that birth analogy.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.920]   Well, James picks up on that here once again.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.420]   But this time, the path is quite different.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.320]   "Whereas evil desires ending up giving birth
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.060]   "to sin and death, God gives us birth
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.020]   "through the word of truth.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.600]   "And that leads to us becoming the first fruits
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.500]   "of all He created."
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   So if we were to put this into a diagram,
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.040]   it looks like this.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.540]   God gives us truth, gives birth to truth,
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:23.520]   which makes us into the first fruits of God's creation.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.380]   Now, if you remember back to the Old Testament,
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.720]   the first fruits are the first and best part
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.560]   of every single harvest.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.720]   In the Old Testament times, God's Lord commanded
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.200]   that we all gather up the first fruits
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.460]   and present them to God.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.460]   They are holy.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.900]   They belong to God.
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.100]   In other words, what James is trying to tell us here
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.440]   is that all of us in this room,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.880]   yes, we are capable of sin and evil,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.440]   but you are also the best of God's creation.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.400]   We belong to God.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.880]   Every single person in this room
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.780]   is a unique, sacred possession of God.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.280]   And you weren't meant to live a life
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.280]   that's constantly wracked by sin and temptation,
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.260]   but you were born, you were created
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.460]   to live a life of truth and flourishing.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.220]   You were made to represent the best of who God is,
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.800]   the best of God's love.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.200]   That's who you are.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.640]   That is your identity.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.040]   So how do we live there instead?
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.740]   How do we move from a life of sin and temptation
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.040]   into that place?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:36.180]   Okay, now I know this sermon so far
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.380]   sounded a little bit scalding, right?
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.620]   It sounded a bit like, you're just a bunch of sinners.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.620]   We all are sinners.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.580]   Everyone needs to stop being tempted.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.780]   Stop sinning, behave yourselves,
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.520]   pull yourself up by your bootstrap, Hayden,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.460]   and you're gonna be okay, all right?
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.620]   And you're sitting here like,
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.500]   dude, I brought a friend with me today.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   Okay, this is, we don't need this right now.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.460]   Stay with me, please, okay?
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.400]   Ultimately, this is not a message
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.940]   about making you feel to feel bad and act right.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.220]   Because the answer is, right, the answer to escaping sin
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.180]   is not to just modify your behavior,
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.020]   to do better, to try harder.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.780]   There is a way out of temptation,
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.660]   but it's not by gritting your teeth
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.360]   and trying to live life better.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:29.400]   Rather, it comes from a loving, true relationship with God.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.640]   When we go to chapter four in James, it tells us this.
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.900]   This is how we do it.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.980]   This is the way out.
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.540]   Submit yourselves then to God.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.640]   Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.780]   Come near to God and he will come near to you.
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.820]   Wash your hands, you sinners.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.060]   Purify your heart, you double-minded.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.500]   So for those of us listening right now,
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.600]   you're feeling like you're sick and tired
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.900]   of being sick and tired.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:04.700]   You're feeling like, yes, I know.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.900]   I don't want to do these things anymore.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.640]   I just don't know how to stop.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.740]   Those of us who are feeling a bit hopeless
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:13.940]   because you've tried and tried and tried,
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.580]   but things never seem to get better,
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.420]   at least not for the long run.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.520]   It's a bit of success.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.060]   Right back to square one again.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.820]   Here's the good news.
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.460]   There is a way out.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.460]   There is a way out, and it all comes from a relationship
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.300]   with the God who sees you not as a sinner,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:39.240]   not as death, but he sees you as his first fruit.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.740]   It's in a relationship with the God
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.080]   who wants to give you good and perfect gifts.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.380]   And this is what he calls us to do.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.880]   These are some very real and practical steps
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.720]   that we can take in order to live the life
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.280]   that God has called us to live.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.860]   The first step is this.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.860]   We submit to God.
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.220]   Now I know, again, the word submit
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.200]   often has some very negative connotations to it
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.900]   because when we abuse people who are in submission to us,
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.880]   who are under our authority,
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.600]   that can lead to some really bad things,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.580]   to abuse, to hurt, to pain.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.780]   But remember what we said just now.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.040]   God is trustworthy.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.360]   He is the giver of only good things.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.020]   So when we choose to submit to God,
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.420]   we don't have to fear because God is good.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.060]   And for those of you who are like, you know what?
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.900]   I don't like to submit to anybody.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.940]   I run my own life.
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.300]   Well, the truth is everybody submits to something.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.400]   When you live your own life, when you go that path,
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.900]   you're submitting to sin and temptation.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.240]   You're still in submission.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.200]   It might not feel like it at that time.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.020]   So the point is this.
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.780]   We have to make a choice.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:00.720]   We either choose to submit to God who gives us life
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.600]   or we submit to sin that leads us into death.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.260]   The second thing we do is this.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.240]   It tells us to resist the devil
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.700]   and he will flee from you.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:19.140]   Now I know when we talk about the devil and the enemy,
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.580]   it sounds evil and scary.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.180]   And the devil might appear to be powerful
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.620]   and able to do a lot of things,
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:30.580]   but in reality, the devil is a coward.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.460]   He is a coward.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.520]   And when he's resisted with the prayer
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.420]   that claims the victory of Jesus on the cross,
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.200]   he knows he's beaten.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.760]   He knows he's been defeated.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.980]   Now his tactic, the enemy's tactic
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.660]   will always be try to trick you, to scare you,
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.600]   to whisper lies into your ear, to tell you that,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.200]   "You know what?
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.760]   "Don't bother.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.600]   "We've been here before.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.060]   "We all know how this ends.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.840]   "You won't be able to resist.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.980]   "So let's just come with me straight away.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.540]   "Why are you bothering with all this Jesus stuff?"
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:09.220]   Church, listen to me when I say this.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.080]   That is the lie.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.020]   That is the lie from the pits of hell.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.920]   You can resist the devil.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.260]   And when you resist the devil, he will run.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.320]   Remind yourself that ultimately,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.660]   the enemy has already been defeated
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.400]   because of what Jesus did on the cross
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.200]   and his resurrection from death to life.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.760]   Satan's power in this life might be very real,
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.880]   but it's also very limited.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.000]   His kingdom will not last forever,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.580]   but God's kingdom will.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.480]   So fear not.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.640]   Stand firm, resist the devil, and he will run.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.420]   He will flee from you.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.280]   And the best place we find the strength
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.820]   and the protection to stand firm is to do this.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:00.320]   Draw near to God, and he'll draw near to you.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.900]   This is a promise.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.900]   Draw near to God, and he'll draw near to you.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.200]   Now again, honestly speaking,
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.600]   for me, this is the hardest thing to believe.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.640]   Because as a young boy growing up,
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.220]   I was always terrified of admitting I was wrong,
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.140]   especially with my parents.
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:22.980]   Now we've done a lot of work in this,
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.220]   especially in the past few months.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:26.380]   Me and my mom have had some really good conversation
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.480]   in this area.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.120]   But honestly, growing up,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.620]   anytime I would make a mistake,
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.700]   I would be so afraid to tell my mom what had happened
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.620]   because I was fearful of the punishment
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.540]   that might await me on the other side.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.240]   Terrified.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.940]   This also happened in school.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.020]   One of the things that I hated most in school,
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.720]   I grew up in a British boarding school,
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.480]   and every now and then, almost every day even,
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.680]   my housemaster would pull me into his office and say,
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.460]   "Hey, Ellison, tell me what you've done wrong."
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.220]   I hated that question because on any given day,
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.200]   I'd done multiple things wrong.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.060]   And so I would be afraid.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:04.300]   If I told him something he didn't already know,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.160]   I'd be in more trouble than I already was.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.500]   "Oh, yeah, sorry, sir, I missed physics today."
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.740]   "You missed physics?
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.100]   "I'm talking about that history homework
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.280]   "you didn't hand in for the past three weeks already.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.280]   "What's going on?"
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:18.540]   But maybe you can relate.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:23.260]   Many times in life, when we make a mess of things,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.680]   the natural inclination is to hide.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.800]   The natural inclination is to pull back,
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.200]   to cover ourselves up.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.900]   And we can easily start to do this with God.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.340]   We fall into temptation, we sin,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:42.540]   and we begin to think of ourselves as unworthy.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.100]   We begin to think God doesn't want anything
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.340]   to do with us anymore.
[00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:51.380]   We begin to think He's gonna punish us
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:55.560]   to keep His distance from us, maybe even reject us.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:02.020]   James reminds us here that anytime we go close to God,
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.500]   anytime we draw near to God,
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.400]   no matter in what situation we're in,
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.260]   His response will never be to stay away
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.700]   or to put further distance between you and Him.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.880]   Remember the story of how Jesus encounters lepers,
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.840]   when He sees lepers?
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.020]   Everyone else would run away from lepers in Jesus' time,
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.780]   but He was the one who moved towards the unclean.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.580]   Remember the story of the prodigal son,
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.360]   how the prodigal son, the younger son ran away,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.760]   but as he comes back, the father's there,
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   waiting, running to the son, not to punish, not to scold,
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.260]   but to love, to embrace, to celebrate.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.080]   And God feels the same way about you.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.740]   This is a promise.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.740]   No matter who you are, no matter what you've done,
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.720]   no matter how many times you've messed up,
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   if we decide to submit, to go close to God,
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.560]   His response is always to come nearer to you.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.660]   It's really that simple.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.700]   When we approach God, He will never, ever, ever reject us.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:21.740]   So how do we respond then?
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.140]   God is ready and He's waiting.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.940]   We need to do some self-reflection here.
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.880]   So I wonder if you just take a time,
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.380]   forget about people around you for a second, okay?
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:39.120]   Some of the things that we're wrestling with
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:43.360]   in this room right now might be really big things.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.660]   I understand that.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.000]   There might not be enough space and time
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.960]   in this moment right now
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.300]   to truly get to the depths of those.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.860]   There might be a long journey ahead of you,
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.140]   is what I'm saying.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.980]   It might require a lot of prayer,
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.080]   a lot of support from your community,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.280]   maybe even some professional therapy.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:03.080]   There might be a long road.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.280]   It's a big mess.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.460]   But the encouragement here is this.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.220]   We have to start somewhere.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:15.000]   So maybe we can start right here, right now.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:22.500]   So you might wanna close your eyes right now
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.400]   and just listen to what God has to say to you.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.000]   (gentle music)
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.700]   And perhaps right in this moment,
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.440]   you have to make a decision
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.500]   about how you're gonna live your life,
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.780]   who you're gonna choose to submit to.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.420]   When we go back and forth,
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.580]   James in this passage calls it double-mindedness.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.760]   We can't make our minds up.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.820]   We can't seem to make our minds up.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.360]   Who do we want to live for?
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.660]   Who do I want to follow?
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.260]   (gentle music)
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:03.000]   So maybe what you need to do right now
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.900]   is as simple as this.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.040]   It's just to make your mind up once again.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:13.340]   Not everything's gonna become perfect immediately,
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.180]   but that's okay.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.080]   It's a journey.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:22.580]   But what we can do is take that first step towards God.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.440]   And as you do that, be reassured, church,
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.280]   my brother, my sister, all that awaits you is love,
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.660]   is mercy, it's grace and forgiveness.
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:46.160]   And in this process, James also encouraged us to do this.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.340]   He says, "To purify our hearts."
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.640]   Because remember, this isn't just
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.680]   about behavior modification.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.140]   Purifying your heart means that you're willing
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.120]   to change from the inside out.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.420]   You're willing to truly confess and repent
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.760]   and to make a real change in the way
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   you've been living your life and who you've been living for.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.160]   But be confident also.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.200]   That you don't have to do this in your own power,
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.780]   but we have a Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.800]   that leads us and guides us.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.720]   Jesus has already done the work of paying the debt of sin
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.520]   so we can live pure and holy lives.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.880]   And maybe your prayer this morning is to ask for God
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.620]   to give you a heart that's in tune with His.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:54.220]   And as we do this church, this is how we submit to God.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.000]   This is how we draw close to God.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And the enemy flees because he has no power
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.600]   in God's presence.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.580]   And you shake off the chains of temptation and sin
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:15.740]   in order to embrace the freedom and the fullness
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.680]   which God has given you to live.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.780]   You are His first fruits, church.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.580]   You are made to reflect God's love,
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.580]   God's goodness to kindness,
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:30.460]   so that everyone around you might know the goodness,
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.320]   the kindness and the love of God.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.600]   So my prayer for us is this,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   that we may live every day drawing nearer and nearer
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:43.940]   to the God who loves us.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.980]   (gentle music)
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.740]   So Father, I thank you for every person
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.620]   in this room right now,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.280]   and all of us, all those who are joining online.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:03.100]   Father, I thank you that no matter what state we're in,
[00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:08.820]   where we come near to you, you embrace us,
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.680]   you reassure us, you love us.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.900]   No matter how broken we are,
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.400]   Isaiah 42, three says, "A bruised reed he will not break,
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.460]   "a smoldering wick he will not snuff out.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.180]   "As long as there's breath in our lungs,
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.940]   "Lord, we can come to you and you draw near to us."
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:37.780]   So Father, with these things we're wrestling with,
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.180]   with sin and temptation and evil that tries to drag us down
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.100]   and entice us and entangle us,
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.380]   I pray for freedom from these things.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.780]   I pray that you would give us strong hearts
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.340]   and strong minds, not empowered by own will,
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.220]   but motivated by your love,
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.980]   and powered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.060]   we would know what the fullness of life is
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.180]   when we walk in step in freedom with you.
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.980]   So Jesus, we love you.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.700]   Walk with us in this journey.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.780]   Help us up when we fall.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.120]   Help us to encourage each other in this.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.260]   And may we truly be a community,
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.500]   be a people that lives as your first fruits,
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.760]   the best, the best of who you created us to be.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   We thank you for this in your beautiful name, amen.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.340]   (gentle music)
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.920]   (gentle music)
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.500]   (gentle music)
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.080]   (gentle music)
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.940]   (gentle music)
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.360]   (gentle music)
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   [Music]
