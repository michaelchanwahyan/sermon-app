1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
 Hey, it is so good to be with you.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,480
 It's actually the first time in two years

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,240
 that I get to preach in person and not to camera.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
 And I'm so thankful for that.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,280
 It's much better to do it with people in the room.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,240
 Now, recently I went to the wet market near my home.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,540
 My wife, Chris and I, we were gonna have over some friends

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,720
 for some Korean barbecue.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,240
 And I also wanted to buy some groceries for the weekend.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:38,160
 And yeah, so I was at the wet market.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,200
 I bought vegetables.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,480
 I bought meat.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,440
 I bought fruits.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,440
 And let's just say I bought a whole lot more

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,920
 than I could comfortably carry.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,680
 Does anyone ever do that?

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,320
 Yeah?

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
 So I'm loaded up.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,840
 And instead of walking home, which would be 15 minutes,

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,720
 which of course I didn't do, I decided

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,960
 to take the mini bus from the wet market

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,760
 to drop me off right in front of my estate where I live.

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,800
 And so I got in line with my bags.

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,760
 And I'm waiting.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,400
 And it's hot.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,240
 And I'm sweating.

27
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,000
 My arm starts hurting.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,960
 I'm shifting the bags around, holding it differently.

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,200
 I'm trying to make this work.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,160
 And I'm starting to think, where is this bus?

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,520
 Where is it?

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,400
 Another 10 minutes passed.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,640
 Now we have 40, 50 people standing in line.

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,040
 And I'm wondering, when is the stinking bus ever going to come?

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,440
 Now, I don't know about you, but I hate waiting.

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,880
 And I especially hate it when it's hot

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,200
 and I'm carrying heavy stuff.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,360
 So truth be told, we all don't like waiting.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,200
 And if you do, you have to explain this to us, right?

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
 But in the big scheme of things, waiting

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,760
 for 15 minutes for a mini bus is really not that big of a deal,

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,280
 even though it was annoying.

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,680
 But what about waiting on some of those bigger and more

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,640
 important things in life?

45
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,080
 Right now, the whole world is waiting for COVID to end.

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,280
 Yes, Jesus.

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,880
 Let's do this.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
 Let's get this over with.

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,320
 For me, recently, I tried to see if I could travel and see

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,200
 family, and it was just too complicated.

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
 I couldn't do it.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,280
 For others of you, it might be your business

53
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,480
 or you're even just being concerned

54
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,120
 about sickness and health.

55
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,720
 But what about waiting on other things?

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,000
 So for example, maybe you started a job

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,880
 and went down a career path.

58
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,400
 But for one reason or another, it's just not working out.

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,840
 And maybe that's something that even God put in your heart.

60
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,960
 And you're, God, what's going on here?

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,240
 Maybe you're waiting on health for you, for a loved one.

62
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,880
 But for whatever reason, things don't

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,120
 seem to be getting better.

64
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,240
 So what are you waiting on right now?

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
 What is one of those bigger things in life

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,800
 where you are waiting for God to act?

67
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:31,760
 So there are things we're all waiting for,

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,640
 for ourselves, for loved ones, for the city.

69
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,200
 But here's the thing.

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,240
 When our circumstances don't change, when we keep waiting

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,080
 and it just continues, we start getting anxious, frustrated,

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,160
 and we often lose hope and perspective.

73
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,720
 Now, I found myself actually quite often going

74
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,440
 through a difficult period of time.

75
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,200
 So there was a time when for a year long,

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,720
 I could not sleep well.

77
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,800
 And I was living in fear.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,320
 Then there was another time where my dad

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,280
 was diagnosed with cancer.

80
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,200
 And it was a very difficult period of waiting.

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,040
 And we prayed.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,120
 And I prayed that my dad would be well again.

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 But it did not happen.

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,080
 And most recently, there was a time with my first wife

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,840
 where she left me and filed for divorce,

86
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,920
 talking about a disorienting time.

87
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,680
 And I was praying to God, God, will I ever feel whole again?

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,080
 And honestly, I struggled to trust God

89
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
 and to believe that my life could be good again.

90
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,160
 And there was even a point where I said, take me, Lord.

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,520
 I don't care.

92
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,040
 And then there was questions.

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,480
 Why is this happening to me?

94
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,320
 What did I do to deserve this?

95
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,280
 Why is my life falling apart?

96
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:16,280
 So these are just some of the experiences and times

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,880
 that I've gone through where it's

98
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,640
 been difficult to continue to have faith, where it's just

99
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,200
 been a painful season of waiting,

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,240
 and quite honestly, where it wasn't always easy to keep

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,920
 living the Christian life.

102
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,880
 So what do we do in these difficult times

103
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,680
 when we find ourselves in them?

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,320
 How can we stay connected to God in times of waiting?

105
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,840
 When are we-- when we are discouraged and struggle

106
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,560
 to hold on to our faith, what do we do?

107
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,440
 Sure.

108
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:56,940
 All right.

109
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:04,800
 So today, we're going to actually answer that question

110
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,840
 or look at how God wants to speak to us

111
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,440
 about this question.

112
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,400
 And we're continuing in the Summer Psalms sermon series.

113
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,840
 Last week, we heard a wonderful message

114
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,320
 from Pastor Carla, who shared with us about seeking

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,960
 after God's presence and desiring that.

116
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,920
 And today, we're going to look at Psalm 37.

117
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,120
 Now, let me give a little bit of context.

118
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,400
 Psalm 37 is a psalm that's attributed to King David.

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,200
 And David, he was a king that was no stranger to waiting.

120
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,160
 He knew what it was to wait.

121
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,200
 He was anointed as king.

122
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,880
 But then there was an over 10-year period

123
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,360
 where nothing happened.

124
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
 And King Saul continued being the king.

125
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,160
 And not only that, he actually was persecuted

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,760
 and had to hide in caves and stuff like that.

127
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,880
 And so he knows what it means to wait.

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,640
 And so the psalm was written to a community who

129
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,280
 was struggling with their life circumstances

130
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,800
 and waiting on God.

131
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,920
 It's addressed to people who are on the verge of losing

132
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,600
 their faith, their hope in God.

133
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,120
 So there is a general biblical wisdom in Psalm 1

134
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,840
 that says that faithful living results in well-being

135
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,480
 and flourishing.

136
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,880
 That's the introduction to all of the psalms.

137
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,640
 But what if that just doesn't seem to be happening?

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,840
 That's why Psalm 37 is written to a community of faith

139
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,760
 where that doesn't seem to be happening,

140
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,920
 but where people are walking through a season

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,320
 of disorientation, where they're just lost.

142
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,360
 And they don't know what to do.

143
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,120
 And they're on the brink of losing

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,400
 their hope and their way.

145
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,920
 So I think that's something that we all

146
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,080
 can relate at in this time.

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,240
 We've been going through a season of disorientation.

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,160
 And so I think this is a word and season for us,

149
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,880
 where God wants to speak to us about our waiting

150
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,640
 through his word.

151
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,920
 So the psalm, it's not about addressing

152
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,360
 the question of suffering and the difficulty.

153
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,960
 But instead, it provides guidance and encouragement

154
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,880
 on how to live when you find yourself

155
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,560
 hard-pressed walking through a difficult season.

156
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
 And so let's look at the first nine verses in Psalm 37.

157
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,720
 I'm going to read them to us.

158
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,480
 Starting in verse 1, it says, "Do not

159
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,760
 fret because of those who are evil,

160
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
 or be envious of those who do wrong.

161
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,720
 For like the grass, they will soon wither.

162
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,920
 Like green plants, they will soon die away.

163
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,520
 Trust in the Lord.

164
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,080
 Do good.

165
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,800
 Dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.

166
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,520
 Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you

167
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,920
 the desires of your heart.

168
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,960
 Commit your way to the Lord.

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,840
 Trust in him, and he will do this.

170
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,760
 He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,

171
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,360
 your vindication like the noonday sun.

172
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,640
 Be still before the Lord, and wait patiently for him.

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,920
 Do not fret when people succeed in their ways,

174
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,960
 when they carry out their wicked schemes.

175
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,680
 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath.

176
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,640
 Do not fret.

177
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,600
 It leads only to evil.

178
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,040
 For those who are evil will be destroyed,

179
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,640
 but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land."

180
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,440
 So the psalm pictures a community

181
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,920
 at a crossroads, a crisis of faith, times of temptation,

182
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,680
 but also a very difficult time of waiting.

183
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,680
 So a lot of times when we think about waiting,

184
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,360
 we picture ourselves as being passive.

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,240
 We're just waiting to get through something,

186
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,960
 or we're waiting for those storm clouds to lift and move on

187
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,240
 so we're not being poured down on.

188
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,000
 But that's not how the psalm is encouraging us.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,040
 Yes, there are circumstances where we are powerless,

190
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,840
 that we can change, but there's still

191
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,200
 choices and actions that we can take,

192
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,160
 even in the midst of these difficult seasons of waiting.

193
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,520
 So what are some of those choices

194
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,080
 that we can make that the psalm wants to encourage

195
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,440
 us to connect with God with?

196
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,320
 Well, let's take a look.

197
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,520
 The first one is in verse 3.

198
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,120
 It says, "Trust in the Lord."

199
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,160
 Well, trusting in the Lord means handing over to Him

200
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,000
 what's going on and asking Him to take care of it

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,400
 because we can't, and to meet us in that place of need,

202
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:28,200
 and just placing ourselves in His loving and caring hands.

203
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,400
 So that's an active step that we can take,

204
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,040
 but we often don't take.

205
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
 Well, why do we struggle to actually trust in the Lord?

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
 What's so hard about that?

207
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,320
 Well, here's one reason, perhaps.

208
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,200
 A lot of times we struggle to trust in the Lord

209
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,840
 because we like being in control.

210
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,800
 We like taking care of things ourselves.

211
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,520
 We do everything possible to take care of something

212
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,240
 ourselves before we acknowledge, hey, I actually need help,

213
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,840
 let alone need help from God.

214
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,760
 Is anyone with me on that?

215
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,280
 Yes?

216
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,000
 Yeah, I do that.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,840
 So we're self-reliant.

218
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
 We're prideful.

219
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,840
 We want to take care of things ourselves.

220
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,640
 That's one reason.

221
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,200
 But there's other reasons as well.

222
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,840
 So here's another one.

223
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,600
 We struggle to trust in the Lord because we're

224
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 fearful that when we do, we're going to be disappointed

225
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,520
 because perhaps we've come to God beforehand

226
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,320
 and entrusted something to Him.

227
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,080
 But for one reason or another, it just

228
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,880
 didn't work out the way we hoped for and we're wishing.

229
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,360
 And so we're scared to make ourselves vulnerable again

230
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,040
 because we don't want to get hurt again.

231
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,600
 We struggle to trust that God is good, that He loves us,

232
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,680
 and that He's powerful enough to meet us and to act.

233
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:56,600
 But despite our tendency to be self-reliant

234
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,520
 and wanting to take care of things on our own strength

235
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,400
 and also to be fearful to be disappointed again,

236
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,560
 the psalm encourages us to trust in the Lord.

237
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,240
 God wants to show you His goodness.

238
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,760
 He wants to meet you in this difficult thing

239
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,920
 that you are going through, that you are facing.

240
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,120
 He wants to show you His grace and His hope and His help.

241
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,120
 And the community of faith, the Christian community,

242
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,160
 the church, divine church, affirms that,

243
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,280
 the experience of the people.

244
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,160
 And we have known this to be true.

245
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,000
 And so we're encouraged to trust in the Lord.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
 So one of the ways to trust God that

247
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,160
 has been most helpful for me personally

248
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,720
 is to surrender yourself to God's care

249
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,960
 and entrust whatever is going on to Him through prayer.

250
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,320
 And this is real talk.

251
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
 This is not like pretending how beautiful we're doing.

252
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,120
 This is like really pouring out our heart and our pain,

253
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,480
 our struggles, and whatever we're feeling to God

254
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,400
 and saying, you take this, and handing it over to Him.

255
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,400
 So when my father was diagnosed with cancer in 2006,

256
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,840
 that was a season where I and my family, we turned to God

257
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,600
 and we started trusting in the Lord with what was going on.

258
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
 And we were handing Him over what we're feeling

259
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
 and what we're worried about and concerned about,

260
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,720
 and of course, asking for God to heal my father.

261
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,120
 And sometimes that praying came easy.

262
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,280
 And other times, you kind of hit a wall.

263
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
 And like, you know what?

264
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,720
 I don't feel like praying.

265
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,520
 Or I feel like I've already said everything.

266
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
 What else is there to say?

267
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
 It's already been said.

268
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,160
 So there are a lot of circumstances

269
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,800
 that we cannot control, where we cannot change what's happening

270
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,480
 out of our own strength.

271
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,400
 I couldn't make my father healthy again.

272
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,520
 But in those circumstances where we are powerless,

273
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,960
 God is powerful.

274
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,040
 And He wants to meet us.

275
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,800
 He wants us to know His presence, that He is with us,

276
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,080
 that we are not alone.

277
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,720
 If He chooses to, He also has the power to heal.

278
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,440
 So He is able to do that.

279
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,040
 And I honestly, as we were walking through the season,

280
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,960
 I do not know how you do that without faith in Jesus.

281
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,600
 You know, what else is there to hold on

282
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,520
 during these difficult seasons?

283
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,680
 Honestly, what else is there?

284
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,880
 Jesus is our anchor in the storm.

285
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,480
 As we're walking through these intense periods of waiting

286
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,040
 and of pain.

287
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:08,800
 So in 2007, my father actually passed away.

288
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,880
 But I can honestly share that despite that--

289
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,280
 and it's still something that makes me sad even to this day--

290
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,480
 but me and my family, we experienced the grace of Jesus

291
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,440
 and His presence as we were walking

292
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,600
 through this difficult time.

293
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
 And I want to share a little bit more

294
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,920
 about that, how we experienced His goodness.

295
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,160
 I was living in the US.

296
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,320
 I'm from Germany originally.

297
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 I'm a "Datquokian."

298
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,240
 All right?

299
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,760
 It's like one of my few words that I know.

300
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,000
 And I had been gone for 10 years.

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,120
 I left when I was quite young.

302
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,840
 And I actually even had made a decision,

303
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,320
 I will never go back to Germany again.

304
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,200
 I had decided that because I loved it.

305
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,480
 So it really was a miracle that I moved to Germany in 2005

306
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,920
 before my father was diagnosed with cancer.

307
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,920
 But then as I was entrusting all of this to God in prayer

308
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,520
 when once my father was diagnosed,

309
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,880
 God revealed to me and showed me that He

310
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,360
 knew that my father would be sick

311
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,320
 and that He brought me back for this season

312
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,240
 so I could be there with him, could be with my mom.

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,080
 Both of my other siblings were in the US.

314
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,880
 But also because I had been gone so long,

315
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,400
 I just haven't had as much quality time

316
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,200
 to be with my father.

317
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,000
 So God showed me His love through revealing that

318
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,680
 and showing that to me, through His sovereignty.

319
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,800
 He knew about this.

320
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 And He showed us His grace and goodness in that,

321
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,400
 even though, again, it's not easy.

322
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,440
 On another occasion, my father took my hand,

323
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,200
 he put it under his arm, and he wanted

324
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,520
 me to feel a tennis ball-sized tumor.

325
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,160
 And he was sharing with me the pain

326
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
 that he was experiencing that was keeping him

327
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,840
 from being able to sleep.

328
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,320
 And he also was sharing with me that he was done with prayer.

329
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,840
 And it was like one of those low, discouraging moments.

330
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,160
 And by God's grace, he gave me words of comfort

331
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,120
 to share with my dad.

332
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,480
 Now, if you're-- you know, some father-son dynamics,

333
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,920
 it's not always that easy.

334
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
 And honestly, I usually would not

335
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,960
 see myself in the role of ministering to my father.

336
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,080
 But God really gave me the grace to be able to do that.

337
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,000
 And we talked about hope and the resurrection.

338
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,600
 And we talked about when we don't have words to pray,

339
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,800
 how in Romans 8, it talks about that the Holy Spirit intercedes

340
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,600
 for us, you know, and we lack the words.

341
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,440
 And so I was able to bring some comfort and some hope

342
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,720
 in this situation.

343
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,520
 And I see that as grace.

344
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,300
 And I'm convinced I would not notice

345
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,720
 if I would have not entrusted what was going on to the Lord.

346
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,000
 So Jesus really met me, and he met my family

347
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
 in this difficult season.

348
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
 And we could, despite the difficulty,

349
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,400
 we could know his love, his presence, and his goodness.

350
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
 And if you're walking through a difficult season

351
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,640
 like that yourself, Jesus wants you to know,

352
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,680
 you know, his love, his presence.

353
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,200
 He wants to share his comfort with you.

354
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
 And I also want to say that, you know,

355
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,560
 we are so glad you're here.

356
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,000
 We love you.

357
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,040
 And we would love to sit with you, listen, talk, and also

358
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,840
 pray.

359
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,960
 So one of the ways that the psalm encourages

360
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,520
 us to connect with God as we're walking

361
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:59,480
 through difficult seasons is to place our trust in the Lord.

362
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,520
 So what is Jesus asking you to entrust to him,

363
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,160
 to hand over to him right now?

364
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,720
 Where do you need Jesus to meet you?

365
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,480
 He wants to show you his love.

366
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,320
 He wants to show you his care.

367
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,600
 So I want to encourage you to open your heart

368
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 and trust yourself to him.

369
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:28,320
 So there's other ways that the psalm encourages us.

370
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,400
 And in verse 3, the second part, it says, do good.

371
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,360
 Trust in the Lord.

372
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,280
 Do good.

373
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,680
 Not what comes to mind.

374
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,520
 When I'm thinking of walking through a difficult time,

375
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,020
 right?

376
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,280
 Is this a joke?

377
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
 Of course it's not.

378
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,480
 And I want to make one thing very clear.

379
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,400
 It's not that God is asking us to ignore what's happening.

380
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,960
 He's not asking us to get busy working so we can forget

381
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,040
 about what's going on.

382
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,440
 And we can see that, even just by the fact

383
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,120
 that it says prior, trust in the Lord, which is acknowledging

384
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,880
 what is happening.

385
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 And so, well, if it doesn't mean that,

386
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,520
 what is this doing good thing all about?

387
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,720
 Now, I think there's two reasons for that.

388
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,400
 The first one is, even though we're

389
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
 walking through a difficult season, a lot of times,

390
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,680
 God still has some good for us that he invites us in,

391
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,560
 that he wants us to do, that we can be part of,

392
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,080
 that can actually be quite life-giving.

393
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,040
 But there's a second reason why we're encouraged to do good.

394
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,760
 Because as we walk through these difficult seasons,

395
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,520
 there is also temptation.

396
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,640
 So in verses 1 through 2, it talks about to not fret

397
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,520
 and to be envious of the evildoers who are flourishing

398
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,960
 and are doing well.

399
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,240
 And it's so easy to get focused on others

400
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,240
 and what's happening with them and to get all worked up.

401
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
 And if we stay in that mind space

402
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 and we allow ourselves to get all worked up,

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,680
 then the temptation becomes strong to actually do

404
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,600
 what they do to get what they have.

405
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,160
 In verse 8, it warns us of that.

406
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,880
 It says, "Refrain from anger and turn from wrath.

407
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,040
 Do not fret.

408
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,200
 It leads only to evil."

409
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,080
 So you can see that progression there.

410
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,080
 So we're meant to drop it.

411
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,920
 And we have before us these choices of doing good,

412
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,400
 but also the choice of temptation

413
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,840
 and doing what is wrong.

414
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,800
 And they're both right there a lot of times

415
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,720
 in these difficult seasons as we're walking through them.

416
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,000
 So what the psalmist is saying is that we have a choice

417
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
 in these tense periods of waiting,

418
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,920
 in these crisis of faith moments.

419
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,880
 We can do good and honor God,

420
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,160
 or we can become so consumed by our circumstances

421
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,440
 and perhaps the injustice of what's happened

422
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,200
 that we do what is wrong.

423
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
 So as I was going through a season

424
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,400
 where my first wife left me,

425
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,240
 there was obviously a lot of pain and grief

426
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,720
 and also some anger.

427
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,920
 And it would have been easy to have thoughts of retaliation,

428
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,320
 of wanting to somehow hurt back.

429
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,480
 And truth be told, those thoughts came up

430
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,160
 as you're dwelling on this deep rejection

431
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,560
 that you're experiencing.

432
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,520
 But I'm thankful to God that I didn't act on that,

433
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,200
 and neither did she.

434
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,080
 And so as I was walking through this time,

435
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,360
 there was this choice of doing good

436
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,200
 and good work that the Lord had for me.

437
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,080
 But there was also this temptation of doing what's wrong.

438
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,440
 Well, what was this good thing that God had me?

439
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,480
 Here's one example.

440
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,760
 I had the option of teaching,

441
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,240
 so I had stepped down from being a pastor.

442
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,240
 I'm functioning maybe at 25%.

443
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,000
 But one thing I could still do

444
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,680
 was teach a Jesus Explored course,

445
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,080
 which is a very basic introductory to Christianity course

446
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,240
 for those who are exploring

447
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,520
 what does it mean to be a Christian?

448
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,800
 What was Jesus all about?

449
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,160
 And a safe place for people to ask questions.

450
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,360
 And that was one thing that I could still do, and I did it.

451
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,200
 And honestly, it was life-giving to me

452
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,240
 in this difficult season.

453
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,400
 It wasn't always easy.

454
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,440
 Sometimes I was like, why am I doing this?

455
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,000
 But it was still some good that I could do,

456
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,480
 that God invited me into.

457
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,360
 So it's amazing how when we do good,

458
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,800
 our focus starts shifting

459
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,200
 from what is causing us to be anxious and frustrated

460
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,620
 to the things that God wants to do through us.

461
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,760
 So what are some of those good things right now

462
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,340
 in your season that God is laying before you?

463
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,340
 No, we don't have to force it,

464
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,480
 but if there's something, he will show you.

465
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,440
 Now, another thing that we're encouraged to do

466
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,680
 in these seasons of waiting

467
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,240
 is to see God's goodness

468
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,000
 and to delight in the Lord.

469
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,560
 Now, let me explain this.

470
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,080
 So in verses three and four,

471
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,720
 really what's happening in the Psalm

472
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 is that the Psalmist is encouraging us to shift our focus

473
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,640
 'cause we're so all consumed by what's happening.

474
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,000
 And that's okay, that's natural.

475
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,240
 But he knows if we remain there, that's not good.

476
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,360
 So he's wanting to shift our focus

477
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,000
 to start connecting with God

478
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,460
 and to see God in all of this.

479
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,400
 So we're already looked at.

480
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,320
 We're invited to trust in the Lord.

481
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,120
 We're invited to do good.

482
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,200
 And then now we're told that we are called

483
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,900
 to dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.

484
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:05,800
 Now, why is this being highlighted here?

485
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,520
 Well, the land in Israel's history

486
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,880
 is of course the promised land.

487
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,040
 You know, it's God's goodness to his people.

488
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,440
 And they're meant to dwell in it and enjoy it,

489
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,080
 enjoy God's goodness.

490
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,520
 They're meant to see God's goodness.

491
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,480
 And he's also not only that,

492
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,140
 he's also giving them protection,

493
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,040
 you know, to enjoy safe pasture where they can work,

494
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,520
 where life can flourish.

495
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,680
 There is something that can flourish.

496
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,720
 But the Psalmist is wanting us to see that

497
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,380
 because we struggle to see that.

498
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,280
 We struggle to see God's goodness.

499
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,840
 And then the next thing we're told,

500
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,560
 and this is almost like audacious,

501
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,200
 take delight in the Lord.

502
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,100
 It's like, really?

503
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,000
 Like, I mean, if somebody tells you that,

504
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,080
 you might wanna slap them, you know, right?

505
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
 In the difficulty.

506
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,320
 But what does this mean?

507
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,120
 Because this is literally the last thing

508
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,200
 that would come to our mind

509
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,080
 as we're walking through these difficult seasons, right?

510
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,620
 So what is this talking about?

511
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,360
 It's not talking about a fake delighting.

512
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,040
 I don't know if you've ever seen that

513
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,200
 where somebody just conjures up this energy

514
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,120
 and is really trying to make themselves happy or feel good.

515
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
 That's not what we're talking about.

516
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,520
 But we're talking about a genuine delighting in God

517
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,760
 and who He is.

518
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,440
 And that really is the Holy Spirit's work.

519
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,720
 I don't think we can, in those moments,

520
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,600
 out of our own strength, delight in the Lord.

521
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,280
 But God can give us that, you know,

522
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,480
 through the Holy Spirit's work,

523
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,440
 that we're actually able to see God's goodness,

524
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,040
 even in the midst of difficulty and challenges.

525
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,800
 So one of the ways that has been helpful for me

526
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,440
 to move towards delighting in the Lord,

527
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,320
 and I say intentionally move towards

528
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,640
 because it's a process or has been a process for me,

529
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,640
 is to start seeing God's goodness

530
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,080
 and how He's been good to me in these difficult seasons

531
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,880
 that I've walked through.

532
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,720
 And a lot of times,

533
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,140
 we can't actually see that even on our own.

534
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,840
 It's a lot of times through community

535
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,400
 that for one might be even God's goodness to us,

536
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,880
 but it also helps us to see God's goodness in our lives

537
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,900
 in the midst of all of what's going on.

538
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,900
 And so, as I was walking through this difficult season

539
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
 of marital breakdown,

540
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,240
 I was meeting with my spiritual director

541
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,580
 and also my friend Tom.

542
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,260
 And we were processing a lot of the grief,

543
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,780
 the pain, the confusion.

544
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,020
 And that really was the focus at the beginning.

545
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,840
 That's all we talked about.

546
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,340
 But it was a point where it's time for me to shift my focus.

547
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,960
 And so Tom made that shift.

548
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,580
 I couldn't make that on my own.

549
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,020
 And he challenged me.

550
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,460
 He challenged me to see God's goodness.

551
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,200
 And he highlighted ways that he knew

552
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,940
 that God was being good to me.

553
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,720
 And one of the ways that God was being good to me

554
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,360
 was I had people in my life that loved me.

555
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,580
 He had given me a family that I lived with.

556
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,060
 I've preached about that another time.

557
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,900
 It was an expression of God's goodness.

558
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,800
 And being able to see that was so powerful

559
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,680
 and so encouraging.

560
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,480
 It's like you're sitting in the darkness

561
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,420
 and suddenly there's this ray of light.

562
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,860
 And that's wow.

563
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,420
 Even here, God is here.

564
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,740
 He's good.

565
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,020
 And of course it doesn't mean that the difficulty

566
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,460
 or the pain disappears,

567
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,500
 but it is so encouraging to see God's goodness

568
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,340
 when we're sitting in this darkness.

569
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,680
 (Tom sighs)

570
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:46,140
 So I realized that I actually had lost sight of that.

571
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,220
 And I decided to pray and to reflect on that myself

572
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,620
 because I wanted to see how is God being good.

573
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,920
 And there's been very particular and unique ways

574
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,500
 that God showed me his goodness.

575
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,040
 And I'll share one.

576
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,600
 The other one is too strange.

577
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,700
 All right.

578
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,640
 But this actually had to do with the Jesus Explored course.

579
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,480
 So I taught that.

580
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,620
 And it's actually one of my favorite things

581
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,860
 as a pastor to teach these type of things.

582
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,420
 And there was a mainland Chinese scholar

583
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,460
 who was attending this Jesus Explored course.

584
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,080
 And it was so amazing to see over the period of time,

585
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,780
 Jesus revealing himself to her.

586
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,660
 And even her discovering more who God was

587
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,620
 and getting really excited about God's word.

588
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,800
 And she ended up becoming a Christian.

589
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,000
 And for me, that was so amazing.

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,460
 And really was God's goodness

591
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,760
 that he would use me in this difficult time in my life

592
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,600
 as an utter mess.

593
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,720
 And I'm not a pastor at that time anymore,

594
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,120
 but still allowing me to function.

595
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
 You know, at least in this instance,

596
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,560
 being able to care for somebody spiritually.

597
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,400
 And then I also was able to have the baptizer

598
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,080
 and it was such a great joy.

599
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,500
 So God was, I heard that, Katie.

600
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,400
 So God was being good to me, you know, in this way.

601
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,980
 So seeing God's goodness

602
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:13,420
 as a way that we can start delighting in God.

603
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:20,780
 Who he is, his love for us, his faithfulness,

604
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,020
 his goodness, his comfort.

605
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,760
 And we can start doing that even in difficult circumstances.

606
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,000
 Now, I wanna take a moment and honor actually you.

607
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,120
 So as a community groups pastor,

608
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,960
 I get to visit community groups.

609
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,180
 And there's a lot of you that are walking

610
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,140
 through difficult seasons.

611
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,180
 You know, it's one thing to delight in the Lord

612
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,740
 when your life is fantastic.

613
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,640
 But to see people delighting in the Lord

614
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,440
 when their life is very difficult,

615
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,200
 you know, that honors God.

616
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,160
 And it is so powerful.

617
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,640
 And I get to see it and it's so beautiful.

618
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,840
 And I know that everyone is so encouraged by that.

619
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,100
 And it honors God.

620
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:16,040
 So earlier I mentioned that a lot of times

621
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,840
 as we walk through these difficult seasons,

622
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,840
 you know, that we struggle to see God's goodness

623
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,920
 and delight in him.

624
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,560
 But God wants to show it to you.

625
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,600
 He wants to reveal it to you.

626
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,000
 And if you're struggling to see that,

627
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,700
 you know, one thing we can do is,

628
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,840
 for one, be part of a community, honestly.

629
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,760
 As a community groups pastor, I'm obligated to say that.

630
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,760
 But, and secondly, you know, just ask him

631
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,720
 and pray to reveal his goodness to you.

632
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,760
 And when he does, you know,

633
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,200
 the Holy Spirit reveals that to you.

634
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,760
 Then take delight in the Lord and give him praise

635
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,720
 for who he is and how he's meeting you.

636
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,840
 So as we walk through these seasons of waiting,

637
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,600
 a lot of times we, as I mentioned earlier,

638
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,680
 you think about it as just something to get through,

639
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,220
 where we're waiting for this cloud to lift

640
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,600
 and then to move on and we picture ourselves as passive.

641
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,040
 But here through this passage, through this song,

642
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,720
 we can see that we're actually not just passive.

643
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,640
 We're not just being acted upon.

644
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,720
 There's things that we can do and choices that we have

645
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,440
 to make and how we can respond to what's happening.

646
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,440
 We talked about trusting in the Lord, doing good,

647
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,220
 enjoying God's goodness and delighting in the Lord.

648
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,240
 And as verse seven says, these are all ways

649
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,360
 and how we can wait patiently for him.

650
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,480
 We're just talking about God who wants to meet us

651
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,440
 and work and whatever's going on.

652
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,880
 So as I reflect on my own journey, it hasn't been easy,

653
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,380
 but Jesus has met me every single time.

654
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,240
 And he promises us that when we place our trust in him,

655
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,120
 he will never put us to shame, never.

656
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,200
 He's faithful, he's faithful to his people

657
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,000
 and he wants to show you his faithfulness.

658
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,760
 So I don't know what circumstance you're facing

659
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,600
 and what you're going through.

660
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,440
 And I know there's a lot of heavy stuff for a lot of people,

661
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,760
 but I do know that when we turn to Jesus

662
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,160
 and place our trust in him, that he meets us.

663
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,320
 When we invite Jesus into our lives,

664
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,320
 we receive the help, the hope, the grace,

665
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,920
 the strength that we need to go through whatever it is

666
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,280
 that we're walking through.

667
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,800
 And so he has the power to change our circumstances,

668
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,680
 but it all starts with daring

669
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,140
 to take the step of trusting Jesus.

670
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:52,000
 Now, for some of us, this means trusting Jesus again.

671
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,080
 You know Jesus, but for whatever reason,

672
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,240
 maybe it's the self-reliance thing,

673
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,640
 just trying to take care of it by yourself,

674
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,240
 maybe you've been disappointed,

675
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,260
 but I hope that you're encouraged to hand over to Jesus

676
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,180
 whatever it is that's going on.

677
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:13,240
 But for others of us, it might be placing our trust in Jesus

678
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,140
 for the very first time.

679
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,560
 Now, earlier, I briefly mentioned that there was a season

680
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,140
 where I was living in fear.

681
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,460
 Where I couldn't sleep.

682
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,900
 There was actually a time when I wasn't a Christian.

683
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,060
 And I was experiencing spiritual attacks,

684
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,720
 but I didn't wanna talk to anyone about it

685
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,300
 because I was embarrassed.

686
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,860
 I didn't want people to think that I'm crazy.

687
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,100
 But it got so bad that I talked to my father

688
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,420
 and I told him what was going on.

689
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:49,420
 And he asked me, "Tim, have you placed your trust in Jesus?"

690
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,300
 Now, I have prayed to Jesus many times,

691
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,500
 but I never surrendered to Jesus before.

692
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,260
 So that evening, I surrendered to Jesus.

693
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,620
 And Jesus met me.

694
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:09,140
 And he set me free from this demonic oppression.

695
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,460
 And I was able to sleep that night.

696
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,180
 And I didn't have to live any longer in fear.

697
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,460
 I mean, it really was a power encounter.

698
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,780
 So I believe there's people here right now in this room,

699
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,060
 but there's also some of you online

700
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,740
 that like me that evening,

701
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:31,260
 you wanna take the step of placing your trust in Jesus

702
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,060
 for the very first time.

703
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,260
 And if that is so, if that's your heart's desire,

704
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,740
 I wanna lead you in a prayer, in a simple prayer

705
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,020
 that actually can allow you to express this desire

706
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,780
 to express this step of placing your trust in Jesus

707
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,620
 and asking him for forgiveness

708
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,540
 and also accepting him as your Lord and Savior.

709
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,380
 So what I wanna do right now,

710
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,340
 I wanna actually ask everyone to stand,

711
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,020
 everyone who's able.

712
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,700
 And in just a moment,

713
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,700
 we're gonna pray a prayer out loud together.

714
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,300
 And if you're using this prayer to place your trust

715
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,500
 for the first time in Jesus,

716
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,260
 I also wanna encourage you to afterwards,

717
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,620
 to talk to Katie, she's right there in the blue dress.

718
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,840
 We would love to help you to understand

719
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,580
 what it means to be a follower of Jesus

720
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,300
 and how you can grow as a disciple.

721
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,100
 But let's pray this prayer out loud together.

722
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,580
 So I invite you to all pray this with me.

723
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,560
 Let's pray it.

724
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,760
 Jesus, I'm sorry for all the wrong

725
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,020
 that I have done in my life.

726
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,300
 I thank you that you have died on the cross for me

727
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,540
 so that I could be forgiven and set free.

728
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,640
 I place my trust in you and receive your gift of forgiveness

729
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,140
 and the new life that you give.

730
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,300
 Please come into my life and show me what it means

731
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,220
 to know you and follow you, amen.

732
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,340
 So right now, I wanna encourage you

733
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:11,740
 to keep connecting with Jesus

734
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,860
 and pouring out your heart to him as we enter into worship.

735
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,340
 And also if you pray this prayer for the very first time

736
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,940
 as your step of placing trust in Jesus,

737
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,020
 your relationship with Jesus has changed.

738
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,380
 You're now in a saving relationship with Jesus.

739
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,580
 You're born again.

740
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,180
 So congratulations, we're so excited for you.

741
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,700
 (congregation applauding)

742
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
 Well, let's worship.
