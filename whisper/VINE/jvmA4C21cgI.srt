00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 Welcome to Online Sunday Service

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,400
 Welcome to the Online Sunday Service

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,600
 We hope you are watching this safely at home

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,600
 Worshipping with us during this typhoon

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,680
 We hope you are watching this safely at home

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,280
 Worshipping with us during this typhoon

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,580
 My name is Chapman

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,280
 I am one of the pastors here at the Vineyard Long

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,780
 I am Chapman

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,420
 We have a very special guest speaker

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,420
 to share the Word of God with us

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,660
 We do have a very special guest speaker

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,160
 sharing the Word of God with us

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,560
 His name is Alex Forte

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,100
 He is the Executive Director of Branches of Hope

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,100
 Alex is a pastor from the Hope Foundation

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,600
 So let me pray for us

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 as we open our hearts and open our ears

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
 to listen to the message that Alex is about to bring us

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
 Let's pray together

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
 God, please open our lives

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,820
 open our ears

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,820
 and bring the message through Alex

24
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
 to change our lives

25
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
 Father, we pray that as we open our hearts

26
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,820
 you would come and change our lives

27
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
 you would come and transform our hearts

28
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
 through the message that Alex is about to bring

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,820
 In Jesus' name we pray

30
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,820
 In Jesus' name we pray

31
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
 Amen

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
 Good morning everyone

33
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
 My name is Alex

34
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
 I am the Executive Director at Branches of Hope

35
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,820
 For those of you who might not be familiar

36
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,820
 with who we are

37
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,820
 We are the NGO founded by the Vine Church

38
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
 some 13 years ago now

39
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,820
 We serve refugees, asylum seekers

40
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,820
 as well as people who have experienced

41
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
 situations of human trafficking

42
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
 and labor exploitation

43
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,820
 Our mission is to restore the dignity

44
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,820
 justice and hope

45
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
 of these people through the

46
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
 three pillars of our service

47
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
 Care, empowerment

48
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
 and social awareness

49
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
 Now, you might be wondering

50
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,820
 why you're listening to me today

51
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,820
 Actually I'm here as a matter of

52
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,820
 tradition if you will

53
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,820
 Over the years, the Vine Church

54
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,820
 has dedicated one Sunday a year

55
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,820
 to Branches of Hope

56
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,820
 and this has more recently become

57
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
 known as BOH Sunday

58
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,820
 In fact, we had BOH Sunday at the Vine

59
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,820
 Wanchai just two weeks ago

60
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,820
 at which Taz gave a beautiful message

61
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,820
 on Agape, the

62
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,820
 love of God, and Cheri served

63
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
 on the worship team

64
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,820
 For us, it's a way to connect

65
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,820
 with a wider congregation at the Vine Church

66
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,820
 Church members like yourselves

67
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
 are our most important

68
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,820
 supporters and partners

69
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
 and so in keeping with this established

70
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
 tradition and retaining our connection

71
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
 to the wider Vine community

72
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
 this is our third BOH Sunday

73
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,820
 at Yuen Long

74
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
 We would love to be there and see you all

75
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
 face to face and weather permitting

76
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
 we'll come up to visit you very very soon

77
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
 Let's dive right

78
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,820
 into today's message

79
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,820
 by letting me ask you all

80
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,820
 a question

81
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,820
 I'd like you to think about your families

82
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
 your places of work

83
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
 anywhere where you spend a significant

84
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
 amount of your time

85
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,820
 in the presence of others

86
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,820
 Now, here's the question

87
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
 Does anything come to mind, any situation

88
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
 any relationship, any rule

89
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
 that you think isn't fair

90
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,820
 just isn't right

91
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,820
 Think about it for a moment

92
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,820
 Now, let me specify

93
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
 my question

94
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
 Does anything come to mind

95
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
 that is unfair to others?

96
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,820
 Let's be honest

97
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
 when I asked the question initially

98
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
 without specifying who to think of

99
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
 most of us, and I count myself

100
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
 I include myself in this of course

101
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
 would have been inclined to have thought about ourselves

102
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
 Maybe

103
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
 the thought that came to your mind was that

104
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
 annoying thing your family member does

105
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
 over and over again

106
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
 or your thought was the last minute assignment

107
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
 that your boss or teacher gave you

108
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
 or maybe you thought about the bus driver

109
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,820
 who, even though he could see you running

110
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,820
 and waving, still closed the doors

111
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,820
 on you

112
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
 So how does it change your thinking?

113
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,820
 How does it change your

114
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,820
 posture when I ask

115
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
 you to consider this question on behalf

116
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
 of somebody else?

117
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
 What does this say about your role in society

118
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
 and, more importantly

119
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
 in God's kingdom?

120
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,820
 Today, as part

121
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
 four of the Stewarding Our Lives sermon series

122
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,820
 we will take a look at becoming

123
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
 a restorative presence

124
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
 Often, we struggle

125
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,820
 to connect our faith and our work

126
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
 Our work, paid

127
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
 or unpaid, in the home or in the office

128
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
 outside

129
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
 consumes a huge part of our lives

130
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
 Many times, the main way

131
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
 that we connect our faith and our work

132
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
 are in a few simple ways. For example

133
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
 earning money to give to God's kingdom

134
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
 sharing the gospel

135
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
 in the workplace, or just

136
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
 being ethical at work

137
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,820
 While these three ways of

138
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
 connecting our faith to our

139
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
 workplace hold true and are important

140
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
 what I hope to do today is to provide

141
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,820
 a deeper, biblical understanding

142
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,820
 of the purpose that God has

143
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
 for us in our work

144
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
 I'm particularly

145
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
 grateful to Pastor Tim to

146
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
 providing us the stage and suggesting

147
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
 this particular day and topic

148
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
 as one to center BOH Sunday in Yuen Long

149
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
 around. Indeed, I'd like to think

150
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
 that as an organization

151
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
 or at an institutional level, Branches of Hope

152
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,820
 is a restorative presence

153
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,820
 to the community that we serve

154
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,820
 and as an organization

155
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
 we offer an avenue to channel

156
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,820
 and amplify the restorative presence

157
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,820
 of others. But before

158
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
 we get into that in more detail

159
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
 let's open this week's scripture passage

160
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,820
 Turn with me, if you will

161
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,820
 please, to the book of Acts

162
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,820
 chapter 6, verses 1

163
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
 to 7, where it says

164
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
 "In those

165
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
 days, when the number of disciples

166
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
 was increasing, the Hellenistic

167
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
 Jews among them complained about the

168
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
 Hebraic Jews because their widows

169
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,820
 were being overlooked in the daily distribution

170
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,820
 of food.

171
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
 So the twelve gathered all the disciples

172
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
 together and said, 'It would not be

173
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
 right for us to neglect the ministry

174
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
 of the word of God in order to wait on

175
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
 tables. Brothers

176
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
 and sisters, choose seven men

177
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
 from among you who are known to be full

178
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
 of the spirit and wisdom.

179
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
 We will turn this responsibility over

180
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
 to them and will give our attention

181
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
 to prayer and the ministry of the word.'

182
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
 This proposal

183
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
 pleased the whole group.

184
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
 They chose Stephen, a man full of faith

185
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
 and of the Holy Spirit, also Philip,

186
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
 Prochirus, Nicanor, Timon,

187
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,820
 Parmenas, and Nicholas from Antioch

188
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
 to convert to Judaism.

189
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,820
 They presented these men to the apostles

190
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
 who prayed and laid their hands

191
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
 on. So the

192
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
 word of God spread. The number of

193
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,820
 disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly

194
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,820
 and a large number of priests

195
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
 became obedient to the faith.

196
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,820
 This is an exciting period

197
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
 in the history of Christianity. The number

198
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
 of disciples was increasing. God's

199
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
 kingdom was growing. But

200
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
 as with any growth or scaling up,

201
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
 there were some challenges.

202
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
 I'm sure there were many other societal

203
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
 problems at the time, but in this passage

204
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
 our attention is drawn specifically

205
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
 to the hunger of Hellenistic Jewish widows

206
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
 that stemmed from a systemic

207
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
 problem. For

208
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
 context, being a widow in those

209
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
 days meant much more than

210
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
 having to deal with loss and

211
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
 grief. Even those things on their own

212
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
 are just terrible. It meant

213
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
 your entire social support

214
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
 system had collapsed.

215
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
 Since husbands were expected to be

216
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
 duty-bound to be the providers,

217
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
 when they passed away, the responsibility

218
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
 was often delegated either to the husband's

219
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
 brothers or to

220
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,820
 the eldest son in the family.

221
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
 Now, imagine

222
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,820
 if there were no brothers,

223
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
 or perhaps if there was a son,

224
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
 the son was not old enough yet

225
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
 to earn a living. Or maybe

226
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,820
 the family just refused outright to carry

227
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,820
 that responsibility.

228
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
 As a result, many widows

229
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
 were extraordinarily vulnerable and

230
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
 reliant on charity and handouts.

231
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
 Now clearly, this

232
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
 was already a recognized problem that

233
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
 was being addressed with the food rations.

234
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
 However, whether intentionally

235
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
 or not, we don't see that necessarily

236
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,820
 from this particular passage.

237
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,820
 The verses make it

238
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,820
 clear that the Hebrew-speaking

239
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
 widows within the community were being given

240
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
 preferential treatment over their

241
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
 Greek-speaking counterparts.

242
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
 So you can really see how

243
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
 in a broken world,

244
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
 even acts with good intentions

245
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
 can aggravate injustices.

246
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
 Our sin blinds

247
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
 us not to recognize

248
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,820
 when we act out of a place of

249
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,820
 prejudice or out of a place

250
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
 of favoritism.

251
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
 And so it becomes systemic.

252
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,820
 We mean well, but it causes

253
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
 more problems. And so being a

254
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
 restorative presence

255
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
 is crucial to consciously counteract

256
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
 this tendency.

257
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
 There are three points that I want

258
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
 to focus our attention on here that allow the

259
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
 twelve to bring restoration

260
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
 to the widows. Firstly,

261
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
 they recognize that the pursuit of their goals

262
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
 was creating a negative,

263
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
 unintended outcome.

264
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
 And they refused,

265
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
 secondly, they refused to ignore the problem

266
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
 because they knew doing so would

267
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
 undermine the purpose of the work that they were engaged in.

268
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
 And lastly,

269
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
 they found simple, relatable,

270
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
 and pragmatic means of solving

271
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
 the issue.

272
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
 There are two important lessons that we can

273
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
 learn from this.

274
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
 The first is this.

275
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
 Pursuing an end,

276
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
 even a holy one,

277
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,820
 is empty if the means are not

278
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
 righteous also.

279
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
 Can you imagine if the early church

280
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
 would have just kept on going how they were doing things,

281
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
 how they were distributing the food, and what

282
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
 negative impact this would have had over time?

283
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
 As

284
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
 Christians, the end should never

285
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
 justify the means.

286
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
 For we may

287
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
 quickly risk losing our way.

288
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
 There are many cautionary tales

289
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
 in the church's over two thousand

290
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,820
 years of history, including horrible,

291
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
 unspeakable transgressions like the Crusades,

292
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,820
 or more recently, the subjugation

293
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
 of indigenous people. We do not

294
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
 need to be as dramatic as citing these

295
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
 particular transgressions either.

296
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
 Maybe you too

297
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
 can think of a situation where

298
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
 you had the best intentions,

299
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
 but ultimately the outcome backfired and was

300
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
 less than holy.

301
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
 But the more relevant lesson, I think,

302
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
 for us in conjunction with the Stewarding Our Lives

303
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
 sermon series, is the question

304
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
 about how we connect our faith and our day-to-day

305
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
 work, and

306
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
 today's topic of

307
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
 restorative presence, is this.

308
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
 Furthering the pursuit

309
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
 of God's kingdom is not

310
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
 just about worshipping

311
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
 and hearing God's word on a Sunday,

312
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,820
 as good and as wonderful as those things

313
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
 are. Pursuing God's

314
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
 kingdom is possible

315
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
 with very real, earthly,

316
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
 pragmatic means

317
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
 by our presence and how we do our work.

318
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
 This includes, for

319
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
 example, identifying and acknowledging

320
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
 and responding to a problem,

321
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
 practicing the division of

322
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
 labor and delegation, relying

323
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
 on the power of the body of

324
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
 Christ. We all have our strengths

325
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
 and weaknesses, but only Jesus can do everything

326
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
 by himself.

327
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
 Recruiting people with the right qualifications

328
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
 for a given task, and of course

329
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,820
 offering everything that we do up to God

330
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,820
 in prayer.

331
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
 The choosing of the seventh story

332
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
 from the Bible is highly

333
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
 relevant to our world today, the work

334
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
 we do, and how it connects

335
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
 to faith.

336
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
 The story has elements of management,

337
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
 human resources, resource

338
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
 allocation, due process, and prayer.

339
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
 If you think about it,

340
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
 the problem, though serious,

341
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
 required a simple

342
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
 administrative response

343
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
 in the pursuit of wider strategic

344
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
 objectives.

345
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
 The clients, in this case the widows,

346
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
 complained. Management, in this case

347
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
 the twelve, put their heads together

348
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
 and promptly came up

349
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
 with an issue, or resolved the issue, with an

350
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
 appropriate reallocation of internal human resources,

351
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
 in this case the chosen seven.

352
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
 Does this not

353
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
 sound something like your places

354
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
 of work? The kind of situations

355
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
 that you face on a daily basis?

356
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
 And yet it was a profound

357
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
 and beautiful act of faith

358
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
 in the pursuit of God's kingdom.

359
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,820
 The point is this.

360
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,820
 We all have the power to be

361
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
 a restorative presence because

362
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
 of our identity in Christ.

363
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
 The chosen seven were

364
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,820
 physically present,

365
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,820
 and through their presence were able

366
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
 to take the actions that brought

367
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
 restoration to the widows,

368
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
 to the Hellenistic Jewish widows.

369
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
 Sure,

370
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
 what we do is important.

371
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
 It is certainly not Christ-like to

372
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
 pursue careers that, by design, exploit

373
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
 people or damage our environment

374
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
 without any mitigating measures.

375
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
 But how we do

376
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
 what we do is just as important.

377
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,820
 Even what seems like a mundane

378
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
 administrative act

379
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
 can become a powerful expression

380
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
 of faith in the pursuit of God's kingdom

381
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
 if we choose to do it out of

382
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
 love and as a form of worship.

383
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,820
 Now, let's take a pause

384
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
 for a moment because I'm sure that

385
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
 all of this can feel a bit overwhelming for some of us.

386
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
 You might be sitting

387
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
 at home right now and thinking to yourself,

388
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
 "Sure, how I

389
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
 do my work or how I conduct myself

390
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
 on a day-to-day basis can be used

391
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
 as an act of worship,

392
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
 but who actually cares?"

393
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
 Or maybe you're thinking, "But I'm just one

394
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
 person. What difference

395
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
 does it make?"

396
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
 Believe me, in my line of work,

397
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
 I struggle with these questions

398
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
 all the time.

399
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
 Especially around impact,

400
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
 around purpose.

401
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
 What is the point?

402
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
 We are confronted with a broken world,

403
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
 immeasurable needs, and finite

404
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
 resources. I can help

405
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
 these two people, but

406
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
 what about the other hundred that are

407
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
 going without any resources?

408
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
 Let me tell you this.

409
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
 The odds

410
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
 don't matter.

411
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,820
 The statistics

412
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,820
 don't matter.

413
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
 And to some extent, even the outcome does not

414
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
 matter.

415
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,820
 The most important question is this.

416
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
 What is your posture?

417
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
 Do you believe in the power of God

418
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
 and his plan for humanity?

419
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
 Do you believe this world

420
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
 will be broken forever?

421
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
 Because if you believe

422
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
 Jesus will come again one day,

423
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,820
 then there is only one logical conclusion.

424
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
 Each and every one of us

425
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
 must continue to serve with whatever

426
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
 abilities and resources we have.

427
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
 The battle we are in may

428
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
 be hard, and granted,

429
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
 we may not be able to see its conclusion,

430
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
 but never forget, the war

431
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
 has already been won.

432
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
 Only by serving may we

433
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
 share in the victory.

434
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
 Let me share

435
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
 a very personal thing

436
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
 with you for a moment, and maybe this will

437
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
 be helpful to some of you.

438
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
 I have often felt

439
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
 overwhelmed by the brokenness of

440
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
 the world, and struggled with periods

441
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,820
 of anxiety because of it.

442
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,820
 One really important principle I have learned

443
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
 in managing this is

444
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
 understanding that my sphere of interest

445
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
 is not the same

446
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
 as my sphere of influence.

447
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,820
 I am concerned

448
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
 about the world at large,

449
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
 but I certainly cannot influence it.

450
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,820
 I cannot change it.

451
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
 So, should I give up?

452
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
 Or, should I shift my focus

453
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
 to the things that I can influence?

454
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,820
 It's easy to be

455
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
 overwhelmed by the world, but remember this,

456
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
 the bigger picture is

457
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
 God's domain.

458
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
 By partnering with Him, you get

459
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
 to let go of all of that,

460
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
 and focus specifically on what you

461
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
 can do, and how you do it.

462
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
 Think of John

463
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
 chapter 1, verse 5, where it

464
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,820
 says, "The light shines

465
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
 in the darkness, and the darkness

466
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
 has not overcome it."

467
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
 Even if you are the only

468
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
 light in a sea of darkness, it already

469
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
 makes all the difference, because darkness

470
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
 is defined by the absence of light.

471
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
 So,

472
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
 if we accept the limits of our spheres of influence,

473
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
 how do we become

474
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
 a restorative presence in our work?

475
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
 It includes three primary practices.

476
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
 Firstly,

477
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
 being rooted in Christ.

478
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
 Before we go about the work of restoration

479
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
 in the world, we must be people

480
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
 of God, and allow

481
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
 God to renew our hearts.

482
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
 Secondly, being a

483
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,820
 cultivator of community.

484
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
 Now, this serves two functions. Firstly,

485
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
 to be a restorative leader, we need to

486
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,820
 be in a community of support

487
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
 and encouragement, but we

488
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
 also need to be creators

489
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
 of community, providing the

490
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,820
 resourcing, the support, and the flourishing

491
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
 to all.

492
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
 And lastly, being an advocate

493
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
 of justice in systems and structures.

494
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
 We're called to be leaders

495
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
 who don't just address

496
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,820
 injustice that results from an individual

497
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
 action, but from collective,

498
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,820
 institutional, and systemic practices.

499
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
 In other words,

500
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
 no matter what our main

501
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
 professional purpose

502
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
 in life may be, and I include in this

503
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,820
 frankly, being a

504
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
 stay-at-home parent, for example, or

505
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
 being a stay-at-home spouse, or

506
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
 a student at school, or university,

507
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
 so not just traditional

508
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
 things that we would consider to be

509
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
 work, but what you spend the majority

510
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,820
 of your time with.

511
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,820
 In all of these circumstances, you can

512
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,820
 be a restorative presence

513
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,820
 by being rooted in Christ,

514
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
 choosing to cultivate community,

515
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
 and being an advocate for justice.

516
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
 Put in even more plain terms,

517
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
 furthering God's kingdom

518
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
 is not just about what you do

519
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
 on a day-to-day basis,

520
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
 how you do it is equally

521
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
 as important.

522
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,820
 I want to dig a little

523
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
 deeper into this relationship between

524
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,820
 the what and the how,

525
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
 and more importantly, the importance of

526
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
 the how.

527
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
 In the story of the choosing of the seven,

528
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
 worrying about the

529
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
 food rations of the widows

530
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
 was definitely not the primary

531
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,820
 objective of the twelve.

532
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
 It was not their "what", if you will.

533
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
 Their focus was

534
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,820
 instead spreading the gospel.

535
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
 That was their main objective, that was

536
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
 the "what" of what they were trying to achieve.

537
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
 So, let's apply

538
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
 then the three practices of being a

539
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
 restorative presence. Number one,

540
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
 I think we can safely assume

541
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
 that the twelve are rooted in Christ. I think we can

542
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
 just put that aside. So, number two,

543
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
 cultivating

544
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,820
 community. They made a conscious

545
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
 choice to cultivate their community

546
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
 by including the needs

547
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
 of the Hellenistic Jews.

548
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
 And number three,

549
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,820
 they then advocated for systemic

550
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
 change, for systemic justice

551
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,820
 by improving the food distribution system.

552
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,820
 This was part of how

553
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,820
 they approached the "what" of

554
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,820
 their purpose, the ministry of the Word of God.

555
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,820
 They knew that

556
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,820
 going after that goal was not going to be

557
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
 possible if they did not change

558
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
 how they were doing it on the side.

559
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,820
 It's easy to recognize

560
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
 the importance of what they were doing and therefore

561
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
 easy to understand the significance

562
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
 of how they were going about it.

563
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,820
 But, let's take a look at scenarios

564
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
 where the "what" may not be as

565
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,820
 comparatively important

566
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,820
 as spreading the gospel.

567
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
 Maybe you're asking yourselves this question

568
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,820
 right now.

569
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,820
 Is what I'm doing even relevant

570
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
 to the Kingdom of God?

571
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
 To furthering the Kingdom?

572
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
 If that is you, may I

573
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,820
 gently challenge you to turn

574
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,820
 your focus away from what

575
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
 you're doing and

576
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
 instead embrace how

577
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
 you're doing it as a way

578
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,820
 to glorify God.

579
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
 Being in the light of God is not only determined

580
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
 by what you do, but how you

581
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
 do it.

582
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
 Let me give you another personal

583
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,820
 example. In my role as

584
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
 Executive Director at Branches of Hope and in my

585
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
 career in humanitarian aid, you might think that I'm

586
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
 filled with purpose

587
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
 and pursuing objectives that are close to God's

588
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,820
 heart. That I recognize

589
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
 ultimately the restorative presence

590
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,820
 of my person and the organizations

591
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
 that I've worked for.

592
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,820
 The truth though is that

593
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,820
 for a big part of my career, I was unable

594
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,820
 to see it that way.

595
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
 I fixated on the fact that

596
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
 I was not a doctor, I was not a nutritionist,

597
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
 I was not an agricultural

598
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,820
 expert or a community mobilizer or a case

599
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
 worker. I agonized

600
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,820
 that I did not have any technical

601
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,820
 expertise to contribute,

602
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
 nor did I feel that I was doing anything really

603
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
 that had an immediate tangible connection

604
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
 to the communities I was there to serve.

605
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,820
 I managed

606
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,820
 and coordinated programs,

607
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,820
 which meant, in essence,

608
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,820
 paperwork, reports,

609
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,820
 plans, meetings,

610
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,820
 emails, and generally

611
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,820
 just administrative work.

612
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
 I was, and

613
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,820
 still am, a generalist.

614
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,820
 Or as some cynics might say,

615
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
 a jack of many trades,

616
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,820
 but a master of none.

617
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,820
 It wasn't until much later, with the

618
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
 help of incredible mentors and coaches

619
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,820
 in my life, that I began to see the importance

620
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
 of being a generalist and that being

621
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,820
 a generalist was a God's gift.

622
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
 Being a generalist

623
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
 means being able to build

624
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,820
 bridges and connect

625
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
 people and perspectives.

626
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
 As I began to embrace my

627
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
 gift, I started

628
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
 to pay more attention to how

629
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
 I was doing my work.

630
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
 A meeting, for example,

631
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
 was an opportunity to cultivate community.

632
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
 Reviewing a

633
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
 proposal or a report was an opportunity

634
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,820
 to ask the hard questions about

635
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
 systemic injustice.

636
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
 More recently, in thinking

637
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,820
 about how I do my work, I tried to

638
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,820
 model servant leadership and

639
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
 focus on the quality of my interactions with people

640
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
 around me. You might call it

641
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,820
 taking a people-centric approach.

642
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
 But the point is that

643
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
 as a follower of Christ, I challenge myself

644
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,820
 to recognize the needs,

645
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,820
 the ambitions, the interests, and constraints

646
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
 of my colleagues, to recognize them

647
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,820
 as people first, and

648
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
 to work with them, not against them.

649
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,820
 In so

650
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,820
 doing, I would like to think that I am a restorative

651
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,820
 presence in my workplace, though, of course,

652
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,820
 you can take some time to ask my colleagues themselves.

653
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,820
 That said, I must also confess that I

654
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
 sometimes fall short of these ideals

655
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
 and let my emotions get the

656
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,820
 better of me.

657
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,820
 But by the power of the Holy Spirit, I recognize

658
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
 my faults and I summon the courage

659
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,820
 to correct and apologize for them.

660
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
 The moral of my

661
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,820
 story is this.

662
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,820
 Ironically, I was only

663
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,820
 able, really, to take satisfaction in

664
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,820
 what I was doing

665
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,820
 after realizing the importance of

666
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
 how I was doing it.

667
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,820
 Maybe you are feeling unfulfilled

668
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,820
 because you are just

669
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
 a paper pusher, or

670
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
 just a stay-at-home parent,

671
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,820
 or just a student.

672
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
 You don't see what impact you're having.

673
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
 But think for

674
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
 a moment about the people God has

675
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,820
 placed around you, your family,

676
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
 your friends, your colleagues,

677
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,820
 even strangers on the street.

678
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,820
 How you

679
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,820
 relate to them can be more powerful

680
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
 than what you do.

681
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,820
 Ask yourself what injustice

682
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,820
 they might be facing, and what

683
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,820
 role you can play in addressing it.

684
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
 You can cultivate community

685
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
 with them, you can cry out

686
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,820
 for the injustices they experience,

687
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
 and you can be a restorative presence

688
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,820
 in their lives.

689
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,820
 Now, as I wrap up,

690
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,820
 beyond what

691
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,820
 the book of Acts, chapter 6,

692
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,820
 verses 1-7 teaches us,

693
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,820
 one thing I like about

694
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,820
 this particular passage is how

695
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,820
 it mirrors the story of Branches

696
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,820
 of Hope. Branches of Hope

697
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
 may not have been founded by the Twelve

698
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,820
 or run by the Chosen Seven,

699
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,820
 although I will say that our founders,

700
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,820
 John Snellgrove and Tony Reed, are old enough

701
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,820
 that they were probably around back then.

702
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,820
 But we were birthed out

703
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,820
 of a ministry of divine church

704
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,820
 in response to systemic injustice

705
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,820
 in our society.

706
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
 And that continues to be how,

707
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
 as an organization, we continue

708
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,820
 to be a restorative presence in the

709
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
 communities we serve.

710
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
 We talked about what it takes to be a

711
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
 restorative presence today.

712
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
 The three primary practices of being

713
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,820
 rooted in Christ, being a cultivator

714
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
 of community, and an advocate

715
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
 of injustice, or an advocate of justice.

716
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
 We also talked

717
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
 about

718
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,820
 what you do not being the only important

719
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
 thing, but that how

720
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
 you do it carries a proportionate

721
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
 amount of importance.

722
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
 I hope that this has

723
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
 encouraged you to become a restorative

724
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
 presence in all of your everyday

725
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,820
 situations.

726
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,820
 Of course, if you'd like to amplify

727
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,820
 your restorative presence, one way

728
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
 you can do that is by partnering with organizations

729
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,820
 who are rooted in Christ, which

730
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,820
 cultivate community, and which

731
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,820
 do the work of advocacy

732
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,820
 by highlighting the injustice in systems

733
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,820
 and structures. In other

734
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
 words, partnering with organizations like

735
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
 Branches of Hope that have a restorative

736
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,820
 presence in Hong Kong.

737
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,820
 That sounds like something that you would like to

738
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,820
 explore. I invite you to talk

739
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,820
 to us the next time that we are in New Long.

740
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,820
 More than anything, we need people to sign up

741
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,820
 as regular monthly donors.

742
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,820
 Any regular amount will help us provide financial

743
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,820
 stability to hundreds of people.

744
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,820
 If just five people

745
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,820
 among you were to sign up today

746
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,820
 to give $100 a month, that would

747
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
 mean that we could support another person through

748
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,820
 our STAR Fund, our

749
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
 monthly financial assistance program.

750
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,820
 Of course, you may also choose to

751
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
 support some of our other programs, for example,

752
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
 our education services or our

753
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,820
 general service fund.

754
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,820
 You can make a one-off donation or you can sign up

755
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,820
 as a volunteer. And you can

756
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,820
 also walk with us in prayer. We have some

757
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,820
 prayer guides available as well.

758
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,820
 Now,

759
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
 lastly, I would like to close

760
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,820
 us in prayer. So,

761
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,820
 if you'll bow your heads with me.

762
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,820
 Lord,

763
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
 I pray that my message

764
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,820
 today has achieved its

765
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,820
 intended purpose of

766
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,820
 helping us discover fresh

767
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,820
 ways to participate

768
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,820
 in your creative, redemptive

769
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,820
 and healing work

770
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,820
 of making all things new.

771
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,820
 May the message today

772
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,820
 have glorified you

773
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,820
 by contributing to the

774
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,820
 broader aim of this sermon series

775
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,820
 of helping us find deeper meaning,

776
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,820
 hope, vision

777
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,820
 and courage for the work

778
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,820
 that we do in our daily lives.

779
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,820
 I pray that we recognize

780
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,820
 the inherent value of how we go

781
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,820
 about our daily work,

782
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,820
 be it in the workplace, be it at home

783
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,820
 or in the school.

784
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,820
 Lord,

785
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,820
 please show us in all situations

786
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,820
 how we can further your kingdom and be

787
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
 a restorative presence.

788
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,820
 Please guard our steps

789
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,820
 and keep us on your path so that

790
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,820
 in the pursuit of your kingdom

791
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
 we may never stray

792
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,820
 and get lost in the brokenness of this world.

793
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,820
 Lastly, Lord,

794
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,820
 I pray that the Holy Spirit should

795
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,820
 show all of us, just like

796
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,820
 he showed the apostles and how he has been

797
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,820
 showing branches of hope, how we

798
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,820
 can be facilitators of community

799
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
 and advocates of justice.

800
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,820
 Help us recognize

801
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,820
 not just the struggles

802
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
 of those around us

803
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,820
 but also how you desire for us

804
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,820
 to partner with you to address them.

805
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,820
 Help us be the light

806
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,820
 in the darkness.

807
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,820
 Amen.

808
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
 Thank you, Yun Long. We're looking forward to seeing you real soon.

809
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
 Thank you for

810
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,820
 such an inspiring message, Alex.

811
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,820
 We hope that

812
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
 you are also encouraged by the message.

813
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
 We hope you're encouraged and we pray

814
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
 that the Holy Spirit will come and guide you

815
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
 to bring his restorative

816
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,820
 presence back to wherever you are.

817
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
 We pray that the Holy Spirit

818
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,820
 will help us bring his

819
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,820
 will, his justice, and so on

820
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,820
 back to our environment.

821
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,820
 So that's it for this week.

822
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,820
 We hope we'll see you again next week.

823
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,820
 Thank you for joining us.

824
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,820
 See you next time.

825
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,820
 Bye-bye.

826
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,660
 Bye.

827
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,240
 (upbeat music)

828
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,300
 you
