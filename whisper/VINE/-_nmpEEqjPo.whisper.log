[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Thank you, church.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   And thank you, worship team.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   You can have a seat and welcome the people around you.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Ah.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Well, welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Welcome, if you're joining us online, a big welcome to you as well.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   We are in week two of our sermon series in James.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And if you haven't caught up with last week, because we had the typhoon,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   the messages up online,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Pastor Philip gave a wonderful, beautiful message to start us off in this series.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And so if you haven't checked that out yet, I highly encourage you to do so.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And so we can continue on our journey today.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So James, chapter two, if you have a Bible, you can keep that open.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   We're going to be reading through the passage together.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   So one thing I figured about out about myself is that people have a hard time sort of placing where I'm from.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So, for example, and I just got back from visiting my wife's family in northeast Texas, small town there.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   But every time I'm there, inevitably people mistake me for being Mexican.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Right. Because there's not very many Asian people there.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Right. And because my complexion, I tan very, very easily.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   In fact, let me show you a picture right now.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   OK, so take a look at this picture.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   OK, can you tell me what that is?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Right. So that is my arm next to my wife's arm.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   OK, this is after. Yeah. Right.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   This is a Stevie Wonder song and a picture. OK, like this.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's incredible. OK, I just tan very, very easily.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   And my wife is very white. OK, but this is that's just you know, that's what happens to me when I spend some time in the sun.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   OK, I get dark and people have a hard time placing where I am.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Right. So in Texas, right in Brittany's hometown, I am Mexican.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   OK, look like Jorge, sound like George.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   OK, so it's like my accent throws people off completely.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   They don't have a clue where I'm from.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   But often here in Hong Kong, too, I get mistaken for different ethnicities, nationalities.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Right. People never think I'm Chinese.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And I know this because when they come and talk to me, they always start a conversation in English.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And so, you know, people think I'm Filipino.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   They think I'm Nepalese or Thai, Indonesian, Malaysian, anything else.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And so it's sort of like a superpower for me, I guess.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So I can be all things to all people. Right. Amen. Yes.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So actually, this comes in super handy, especially when I'm in holiday in Southeast Asia.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So this one time I was in Thailand on holiday in Hua Hin, and I decided to go and check out some local kickboxing matches,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   you know, UFC and kickboxing, wrestling. I love all that kind of stuff.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So I go downtown to Hua Hin. I'm dressed like a local.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Flip flops, faded jeans, faded T-shirt. And everyone thinks I sit down.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   You know, people talk to me in Thai. I try to order the food in Thai.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   You know, just very minimal conversation and trying to get by as a local.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And so when I get down to the kickboxing stadium, you notice this.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I notice there's two lines, one for foreigners and one for locals.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   If you go to the foreigner line, first of all, it's more expensive and the seats are like up in the bleachers.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You know, you're away from all the action. But if you go to the locals line, it's cheaper to get in.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And plus, like you're like right there in the pit around the ring, like ringside seats.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And so I look, people up there seem very conservative and boring, just sitting there down at the pit.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   People were like shouting and like, you know, the fighters were hanging out there.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It just seemed like a more fun place to be. So I thought, OK, I'm going to try.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   OK, I'm going to go into the local line and see what happens.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So, you know, I just stand back, observe what people are doing. And then that's what I do.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I get my money ready, you know, go. Don't say much. Just give them the exact money.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And I let get it let into the local line. Nobody questions me about who I am.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Right. And it was amazing. Right. The atmosphere there was so loud, people shouting all sorts of things, you know.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So every time someone would shout something, I would just shout the same thing. Right.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Probably curse words or whatever it was I was shouting. People taking bets. I was throwing money around.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I had no idea what was going on, but I had the best time of my life. Right.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   So exciting being there. But then the fights were over.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I left the stadium and I was just back to being normal Ellison again. Right.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I was never a Thai local. I just looked the part for a moment.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And so this made me wonder, right, does this happen with our relationship, with our dedication and our faith in Jesus?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Most of us in this room today, most of us watching online would probably profess with our mouth that Jesus is our Lord and Savior.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Most of us would say we have a faith in Jesus. If you remember what Philip talked about last week, he was talking about people asking him and his child what religion they are.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   If people ask you what religion are you, you would probably say, well, yes, I'm a Christian.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Right. And we gather together and we all know how to look the part, especially in an environment like this.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Right. Where we're singing and praising, we can lift our hands, we can kneel down on the floor.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Right. If you're in if you've been in church for a while, you probably know how to speak Christianese.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Right. All these things on the outside we can present as a person who looks like they have a dedicated faith to Jesus.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But throughout the book of James, one of the key things we're going to try to be figuring out is how pure our religion is.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   In other words, how do I know if we really have a faith in Jesus?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   How do you know your faith is genuine? And even if I was to ask this more directly, does the faith you profess match up with the way we live our life?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Do we have the kind of faith that God is looking for? And if so, what are some of the hallmarks that genuine faith in Jesus looks like?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   As we walk through the book of James, you're going to figure out this is the kind of faith that doesn't get tossed and turned around with the trials of life.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It's a faith that's completely countercultural to the ways of this world.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   It's a kind of faith that is accompanied with action.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So, like I said, James, chapter two, we're going to open it up.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   This is what it says.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes, say, "Here's a good seat for you."
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   But say to the poor man, "You stand there or sit on the floor by my feet."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   So one of the first things James is trying to address in this part of his letter is something called favoritism.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now, this isn't saying that as people of faith, you can't have certain preferences at all.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Like, for example, if you like strawberry ice cream instead of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, I'd say you're a crazy person.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   But go ahead, right? Get strawberry if you think that's better.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   This is not what it's talking about.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   What James is talking about is a toxic, evil kind of favoritism.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Favoritism that is rooted in injustice and discrimination.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Favoritism that judges people by worldly standards and values.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And unfortunately, the scenario James is talking about happens all the time in this city, in Hong Kong.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I'm talking about people being judged by their economic status.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   There is a disparity in this city between the rich and the poor, and it's very clearly seen as we go about everyday life.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   We have in Hong Kong the largest wealth inequality in the world.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Consistently, this is something we shouldn't be proud about, right?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   This is one of the top three most expensive places to live, right?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, places like that.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   In Hong Kong, it's 有錢大哂, right?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   If you're rich, you can have it all.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   It's often the rich that get the honor and the privileges.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's often the rich get special treatment and recognition.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And meanwhile, the poor are overlooked.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   The poor have to eke out a living in the world's most expensive city,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   cram their families into these tiny, subdivided flats,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   not being able to afford the many things that we might take for granted.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   But the truth is, and this is not a small part of our population,
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   1.4 million people in Hong Kong live below the poverty line.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   How's this for a statistic?
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Oxfam in 2024 found that the median monthly income for the poorest 10% of households
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   was only $1,600 per month, and this was a drop from before the pandemic.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   In contrast, the wealthiest 10% of households have a median income of $131,000.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   This is a rise in 10% from 2019.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   a disparity of almost 90 times between these two groups.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Now, I felt the sting of this firsthand somewhat.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   When I was a teenager, my mom would make me do all sorts of jobs.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So I've worked at all kinds of--I've delivered food on the street in Central.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I've worked at a carnival.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I've worked at a doctor's office, as a receptionist, all these kind of jobs.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Her idea was to expose me to the different ways that people live
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   from my relatively sheltered and comfortable life that I had,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   so all kinds of summer jobs.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And one of the summers, I found myself working at a warehouse in Kwun Tong.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Now, I got the job there because my uncle was the manager of the warehouse,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   my dad's older brother, right?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And so--and this is the kind of place where, you know, all your sort of dry goods
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   at the supermarket sort of sit there before they get shipped off
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   to the park and shops and welcomes and all that stuff.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So I'm talking about, like, toothpaste, toilet paper, bleach, cleaning products,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   all that kind of stuff is put in these warehouses,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and my job was to pull them off these shelves, put them into boxes ready
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   for them to be shipped to the different locations, right?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And it was dusty, it was dirty, it was hot.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   My salary was HK$25 an hour, okay, HK$25 an hour.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   This is about the year 2000, something like that.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Now, for me, I was just doing it as some sort of an experience.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   But I worked with two lovely old ladies who would sit there with me,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   and I was climbing up, and they were packing the stuff.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   But they were doing this for a living, all right?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   HK$25 to survive in Hong Kong.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And yet, they were some of the most generous people I've ever met.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Every now and then, they would take me out for lunch, right?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   This meant going down to the canteen downstairs where a meal was, like, HK$25 to, like, HK$40.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   So they were spending 40--as much as I insisted I don't need this--
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   40% of their daily income to buy me lunch,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   living on HK$25 an hour.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   They had no idea that my uncle was their boss, right?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   They were just doing it because they loved and they cared,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   because that was their heart.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Now, in the same building, there were the corporate offices in the upper floors, right?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   This space was cool and air-conditioned, right?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   People wore suits and leather shoes, making much more than HK$25 an hour.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So I remember, true story, one time I needed to go up to the office floor to collect something.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I was all dirty and stinky from working in the warehouse.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I needed a drink of water, so there's a water cooler right there.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   So I went to get a drink of water, only to be stopped by a member of staff there
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and said, "Hey, don't do that. Warehouse workers aren't allowed here.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   If you need a drink, you need to go back downstairs, right?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   You're getting everything all dirty up here. Don't stay up here."
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   The way I wanted to say, "Do you know who my uncle is?"
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Okay, like I didn't, okay, so don't do that either.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   But stuff like that happens all the time in this city, right?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I'm sure I'm not the only one who has encountered this.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   If there ever was a city where the poor and the rich live right next to each other,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   yet are treated very differently, it's right here in Hong Kong.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Being rich gets you preferential treatment,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   and it so happens that back then, in the time of James, it was the same thing.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   2,000 years, not much has changed.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Now the question for us is, would we let this happen in our church?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   On a more personal level, would you react this way yourself?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   James tells us in this letter that if we find ourselves being inclined
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   to treat the rich with special attention, but look down on the poor,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   this is discriminatory, it's judgmental, and it's evil
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   because it goes against the very heart of God.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Now of course it's tempting to act in this way.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   We like to cozy up to the rich and the powerful
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   because of the benefits that it might have upon us.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   We honor them in hopes that they will give us some of their money and wealth.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   We do it out of the way for them because maybe one day,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   they're going to help us back.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   You scratch my back, I scratch yours, that sort of mentality.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   But what can a poor person offer us?
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   They're just going to drain our resources, drain our time.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   There is no benefit when we pay special attention to them.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Now listen, church, this might be the way the world works,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   but it is ungodly and incompatible with our faith
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   as Christians for us to act this way.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It's evil because it goes against God's heart.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   And as we look through Scripture, God's heart has always been
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   to side himself with the poor and the needy.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Think about the way Jesus entered into this world.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   He didn't come in might, in pomp, in splendor.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   He could have, but instead he came humbly, meek, with nothing,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   nothing that we look upon that we could desire, physically speaking.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   He chose to identify with the poor as he came into this world.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   2 Corinthians 2.9 tells us that though Jesus was rich,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   yet for your sake he became poor.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And so how God calls us as a people of faith to work is opposite
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   of how the world works.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   He tells us that it is the poor that we should pay attention to.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It is the poor that we should open our hands wide to,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Deuteronomy 15.11.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   It is the poor that we should be inviting to our dinners
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and our banquets, that's in the book of Luke.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   It is the poor that the weak that we must work hard to help,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   or the poor and the weak that we must work hard to help, Acts 20.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   It is the poor that we are called to sell everything
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   and give it to them, Matthew 19.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And this beautifully is summarized in what James calls
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   in his letter, the royal law.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   It is the royal law because he got this from his brother,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Jesus himself, who is the King of kings.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   It's what Jesus calls as part of the greatest commandment.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   You are to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   And our neighbor's church are the needy, the widows,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   the orphans, the poor.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   A genuine faith in Jesus will never show favoritism
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   to the rich in expense of the poor.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   A genuine faith in Jesus will always take action
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   and be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   And by the way, favoritism and discrimination
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   isn't just about rich and poor.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Any form of discrimination and favoritism
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   that dishonors people is a dishonor and an insult to God
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   because we have been made in his image.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   But James is using the rich and the poor here as an example.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And to really drive this point home,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   he goes on to deliver one of the hardest hitting,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   maybe one of the most controversial
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and challenging passages in the whole of scripture.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   He tells us this.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   "if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   "Can such faith save them?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   "Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   "and daily food, if one of you says to them,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   "'Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,'
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   "but does nothing about their physical needs,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   "what good is it?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   "In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   "if it's not accompanied by action, is dead."
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Now I say this is controversial
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   because it seems to contradict what we love about our faith.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Our faith tells us that Jesus loves us no matter what
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   and that there's nothing more that we can do
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   to make him love us.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   We say that salvation is a free gift, right?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   It's salvation, grace and forgiveness.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It's a free gift of God.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   There is nothing we can do to earn that kind of love
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that God has for us.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And I would say yes and amen to these statements.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   But it seems as though right now James is saying
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   that there are certain things actually you do have to do
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   for our faith.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   That faith alone is not enough.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And I would say the answer to that question is also yes.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Because remember the point we're trying to answer
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   with the point we made at the beginning,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   the point Philip pointed us towards last week.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   We are trying to determine whether our faith is real.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   We are trying to figure out what this pure religion is.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And pure religion, real faith has to be backed up by action.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Now don't get me wrong, okay?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I'm not saying that your actions are going to save you.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   That's not the point.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   That's bad theology.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   This isn't what James is trying to say either.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   But what we're trying to say is that those who truly follow Jesus
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   will always be able to show you in some way
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   that the faith is real.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Genuine faith has real deeds behind it.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   This is how, when I was doing some research,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   this is how one of the commentaries put it.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   James is not arguing that works must be added to faith.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   His point rather is that genuine biblical faith
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   will inevitably be characterized by works.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   These are hard-hitting questions,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   but we need to get to the bottom of it
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   because our entire relationship with Jesus is on the line.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   James asks us, "What good is it, my brothers,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   "if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   "Can such faith save them?"
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Let's answer these questions.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Notice first that James says "claims."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Now look, just because we claim something,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   it doesn't always mean it's true.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   People make all sorts of wild claims.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   But if we believed everything that everyone said,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   we would be fools.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I could tell you that LeBron James and I,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   we have the same basketball skills.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   What he can do on the court, I can do too.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I can do a slam dunk and shoot threes.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I can do all that kind of stuff.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   You would rightly say, "Okay, prove it."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   There's a court right down there next to the MTR station.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Bring a basketball, show me your skills.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And it's the same thing when it comes to our faith.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   If someone claims to have a faith in Jesus,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   they should be able to show you evidence of their faith.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Otherwise, how will we know that what they're saying is true?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   We can't unless we see their faith in action.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And the second part of that question is even a bit scarier.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Like I said, these things have eternal consequences.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   One of the main motivations that people have in the journey of faith
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   in becoming a Christian is because they want some sort of assurance of salvation.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   They want to know that after they die,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   they're not going to end up in some horrible place called hell,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   but rather live out all of eternity in heaven where there's joy and bliss
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and all the nice, wonderful things you can think of.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Now, going to heaven, being in the kingdom of God for all eternity after we die,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   salvation, eternal life is a promise and a reward from Jesus.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   But only for those who have a real and genuine faith
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   that demonstrates real acts of service and love to those around us.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   So the answer to the question is no.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   A faith that does not live itself out with deeds
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   is not the kind of faith that leads to salvation.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   James makes it even clearer for us.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   He gives another scenario for us to imagine.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   He says, "Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes or daily food.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,'
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   and does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?"
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   It's not a complicated question.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   The answer is simple.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   The Cantonese translation for this type of situation is "見死不救."
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   It's kind of like an insult we use in Cantonese.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   If you see someone in need but you don't help them,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   it's like a pitiful, shameful thing to do.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   So what good is it, asks James.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   The answer is it's no good.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Faith that is not accompanied by action is a dead kind of faith.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   It's no good just to give people your words and well wishes
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   when the needs that they have are right in front of you.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   It's interesting because this kind of behavior sort of makes sense.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   If you follow on from what James is talking about before,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   well if we're only showing favoritism to the rich and the powerful and the wealthy,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   well they don't really need anything.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And so there's nothing really we can do for them.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And so when the needs of the poor are presented to us,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   we too are inclined to do nothing because it doesn't benefit us.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   There's nothing in it for us.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   But at the same time, of course, we're not monsters.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And so let's give them a prayer.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   We don't want to totally ignore them.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Let's scratch that itch on our conscience and give them our well wishes
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   and send them on their way.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   At least we did something, right?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I've been asking myself and I ask you, church, is that what Jesus would do?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Does that reflect God's heart for his children?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And in preparing the message series in James and in working with our team,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I went through and I'm currently going through a lot of wrestling
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   when it comes to this message.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Because if I'm honest, quite often when it comes to a situation like this,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   I feel like my reaction doesn't always reflect the faith that I claim.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   When there's physical needs in front of me that are to be met,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   sometimes I panic, I shrink back, I don't want to do anything about it.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And I make excuses.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Oh, well, you know, if I help them now, I'm going to be stuck helping them forever.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   I don't have the time and the resources for that.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Or you say, is it really going to help that much if I just do this right now?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You know, it doesn't really help them in the long run.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   So maybe it's better for me not to get involved.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Or maybe, you know, like you say, I've already prayed for them.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Right? God can do immeasurably more than I can do.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   So, you know, I've already prayed for them.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I leave it in God's powerful hands and he'll take care of it.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And then I start to feel guilty and ashamed, right?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Because I knew I was supposed to do and I didn't do anything about it.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And it all gets super overwhelming and anxiety starts to set in
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Maybe you can relate to this too.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And I'm working on it.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Okay.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And this is how I try to resolve it and figure it out.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And I'm just being honest and real with you here.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I don't have the answer to really haven't got it all figured out yet.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   But this is what I feel like God is leading me to in situations like this.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   So, like I said, as people who possess faith in Jesus,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   if we ever come across a situation where we can meet an obvious physical need
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   like if we're taking the words of James literally here,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   something immediate that we tangible that we can do,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   then we have to respond.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   We must respond.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So, for example, one thing that I personally try to practice as much as possible,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   when I see someone on the street that's homeless or sleeping rough,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   someone asking for money, I will stop and ask,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   "Can I get you something to eat?
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Are you hungry?"
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And if the answer is yes, then I go and get them something to eat, right?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Go and get a fine hut from down the road, go to 7-Eleven, get some snacks, whatever.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   If I see an elderly lady, often it is a lady, right, pushing those heavy carts down the street,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I will stop her and say, "Hey, where are you going?"
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   Down to the collection point, let me push it the rest of the way.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   You take a rest and I'll push it for you.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Take a break.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It's hot.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   It's sweaty.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   I can do this much easier.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   All right?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   10-15 minutes out of my day, but that should be okay, right?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's always the right time to do the right thing.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   At the same time, I've also had to learn to let go of the idea that I have to solve all their problems.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I don't think that's the point either.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Also, that's impossible.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I'm just a man.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   I'm nobody.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I'm just a man.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I'm not the savior.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Jesus is their savior, and ultimately, of course, we want to point people towards them,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   but I don't want to do nothing.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   I'm not content with just to leave them with my thoughts and my prayers.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   In that moment, in that space, I've done as much as I could.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I've tried my best to show them Jesus' love.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I've responded in obedience with some sort of action, and I try to be at peace with that.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And I think this is what Jesus is expecting of his followers.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   He knows we can't do everything.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   He is the savior, and his call ultimately is for us to bring people to him,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   and he is indeed able to do more than we ask or imagine,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   but he's also looking for people who are willing to take action.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   If you want to be very clear about this, Matthew 25 lays it down so clearly.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   He says this, "For when I was hungry, you gave me something to eat.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   I needed clothes, and you clothed me.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   I was sick, and you looked after me.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I was in prison, and you came to visit me."
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Jesus tells us that whenever we care for the least of our brothers and sisters
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   in these sort of situations, we are doing it for him.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   These are the people who get to enjoy the inheritance and the kingdom of eternal life.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   But he also gives us a sobering warning for those who ignore these needs.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   When he was hungry, and we gave him nothing to eat.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   We were thirsty, and we gave him nothing to drink.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   He was a stranger, and we don't invite them in.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   They needed clothes, and you did not clothe me.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I was sick and in prison, and you did not look after me.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Jesus tells us that those who fail to respond in love and compassion,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   but yet claim to know him, are not just ignoring people, they're ignoring him.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and the consequences are eternal fire and punishment.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Now, let's remember the main point of what Jesus is trying to say.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   How do we know that our faith is genuine?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   A faith that leads to salvation.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   A faith that matches up with what we profess with our mouth.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Because both these groups of people claim to know Jesus,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   but only one is accepted and welcomed into his kingdom.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   It's not just believing in Jesus that counts as faith.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   James goes on to say, "You believe that there is one God? Good.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Even the demons believe that and shudder."
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Just let that sink in for a moment, church.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It is a brutally honest reflection that we're looking at today.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I get it.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   But if a faith is just words, James is telling us that your faith
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   is no different from the faith that demons have.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   We see this all the time in Scripture as Jesus is casting out demons.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   The demons are declaring, "Yes, this is the Savior. This is the Messiah."
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Jesus has to actually say, "Don't tell anyone about this."
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Because they even know who he is.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Now, wouldn't it be a shame if a group of Christians that profess faith in Jesus
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   to have the same kind of faith that demons have?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Demons that are actively trying to do everything they can to distract people from the Lord.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   Demons who are losers, who have already lost the battle.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   We don't want to be on that side, right, church?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   This is a call to embrace genuine faith.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   A faith of active, working obedience to Jesus.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And yes, part of this is our concern for the poor and the needy,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   but it applies to every single part of how we live our lives.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It's a life that's going to take action and risk and sacrifice.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And for example, James finishes with two contrasting characters, Abraham and Rahab,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   to let us know what God is expecting for those who follow him.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Let's look at Abraham first. James writes,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   "Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?"
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   You see that his faith and his actions were working together
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   and his faith was made complete by what he did.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   and it was credited to him as righteousness and he was called God's friend."
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   If you recall the story of Abraham, right, what he called to do was absolutely wild.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   It was insane, right?
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   Imagine you having to wait till you're 100 years old, right,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   before finally God gives you the thing that you've been hoping for.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   A son that's going to finally, your true son,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   that finally is going to pass down your bloodline, that through this son,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   you're going to have generations and generations, as many as stars in the sky.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Only for then God to say, "Here he is, give him back to me.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Sacrifice him on the altar."
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Now, what would you do?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Now, honestly, for me, I don't know.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   But Abraham had a faith that even if God asked him to do something
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   that made no sense to him whatsoever, he would respond in obedience and do it anyway.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   I was trying to put myself in Abraham's shoes as I was preparing this, right?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I have sons, two boys, right, and as ungentle as my parenting is sometimes, okay?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   I can't imagine the fear, the guilt, the gut-wrenching torture it must have been
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   to take Isaac, bind him up, put him on the altar, to raise the knife.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   It was only at the final second before he plunged that knife into his son's heart
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   that God said, "Stop, do not harm the child."
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Abraham put action behind his faith.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And Rahab is the same.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   She translates her faith into action, even though it was super risky for her.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   She had no idea, if you know the story, if the spies would honor their word.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   But what she had heard about was this God that was able to part the Red Sea,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   that people were able to walk across dry land, right, to be saved from slavery,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   that these people had a God behind them that was destroying all their enemies.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   She had only heard about these stories and she decided,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   "I'm going to put my faith in a God like that, not in these pagan gods
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   that my family and my people have been worshipping.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I'm going to put my faith in this most high, living, powerful God."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And she puts her faith in God and she hides the spies.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   And she and her family are saved because she put her faith into action.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Now on the surface, these two people couldn't be more different.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   We have a male and a female.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   We have the founding father of the Judeo-Christian faith
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and a Canaanite prostitute.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And James does this on purpose.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   He does this because he's saying, "It doesn't matter who you are,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   but these are the people that God is looking for,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   those who have an obedient, action-filled faith,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   faith expressing itself through love of God."
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   So how about us?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Are we willing to take risks for Jesus?
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Are we willing to put our faith into action?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Are we willing to face danger to demonstrate our faith in Him?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   What has God been calling you to respond in obedience to?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   What has God been calling you into action?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Translating belief into action,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   even when it seems impossible or downright dangerous,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   that is the faith that matters.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Faith without deeds is dead.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   So having heard all of this, let me ask you one more time today.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Is your faith genuine?
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Because let me tell you, if you're banking on the fact that you went to a rally one time
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   or at youth camp, you said a little prayer,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   and maybe even you were baptized, and since then, your life hasn't changed,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   you haven't done anything to put your faith in Jesus,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   your actions haven't shown that you live a life that is obedient to Christ,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   your heart does not break for the things that break His heart,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   you're not engaged in looking after the poor and the marginalized,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I'm sorry to tell you that's a dead kind of faith, church.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   But if we serve a risen and living God, a God that has come to give us life,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Jesus loves you too much to let you keep going down that road.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   He loves you so much that He gave His life for you.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   How did Jesus show His love for us?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Not just by telling us with His words, as comforting and as beautiful as they are,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   but they're only comforting and beautiful because He put action behind His words.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Jesus stepped out of His throne in heaven.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   He lived among us.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   He healed us.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   He fed us.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   He served us.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   He washed our feet.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   He embraced us.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   He invites us.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   He spoke up for us.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And ultimately, He went to the cross to die for you, to show you His love.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   He put His love into action.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   And He loves you so much that He perfectly lived on this earth
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   to tell us what an active faith looks like.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   He knows you too well to be content just to watch you waste your life
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   by not putting your faith into action.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And when Jesus comes back, He's looking for those who are truly faithful.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Is this what He's going to find when He comes back for this church?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Is this what He's going to find when He looks at your life?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   So I'm going to ask you to close your eyes for a moment, church,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and just think about those things for a minute.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I know it's been hard.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   We've been wrestling a lot with the book of James as we prepared this.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And in this beautiful gathering of God's children who make up this community,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   and as God has called us into the uncharted, He's calling us into action.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And like I said, all this is rooted.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   This is not a guilt trip.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   This is not a bashing over your head.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   At least I hope not.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   But this is a reminder of the love that God had for you.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   This is a reminder of the potential that lives in you.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   The plans that God had in mind when He created you,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   when He knitted you together in your mother's womb,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   that He had a plan and a purpose for you to live out.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And for sure that's one that includes obedience to Him,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   of doing things in the sake of His name that you never thought you'd be able to experience or see.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   But because you allowed God's love and power to work through you,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   you bring honor and praise to Him and life to others by doing that.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And like I said just now, Jesus loves us too much to let us just be content with this comfy, cozy Christianity that is so easy to embrace.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   But rather it's this life-changing, radical obedience to God
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   that will bring salvation to you and those around us,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   that declares God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And so Jesus, we pray, if I could be so bold in praying on behalf of my brothers and sisters,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   that we would not be content just to have a faith that's based upon lip service,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   that's based upon a few songs that we might sing every now and then.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   But it's a life of obedience.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   It's a life that's constantly looking out for ways that we can show your love to others, no matter who they are.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Knowing, as we saw in the video earlier, that your grace is sufficient for us,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   that even if it's the most challenging, mind-boggling, not-makes-sense thing to this world that you've called us to do,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   that we will have the faith to put that into action and do it anyway, knowing you'll meet us where we are,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   that you'll never leave us abandoned, that you'll never leave us or forsake us,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   that we have a helper in the Holy Spirit,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   and we have the Most High God who fights every battle on our behalf.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   So Jesus, make this our heart, our lives.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   May we be your good and faithful servants, sons and daughters, as we live out our life in this world,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   truly worshipping you with everything we have.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   We put our faith in you, Jesus. In your name we pray. Amen.

[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   [music]
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.580]   (gentle music)
