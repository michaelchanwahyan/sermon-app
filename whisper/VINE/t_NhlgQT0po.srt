1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Ben and I support the same soccer team, same football team,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,040
 so it's good to be up there.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,720
 11 o'clock tonight, right, we'll be ready for the match.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,000
 It's so good to be back in Yuen Long

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,600
 and to have the opportunity to be part of this

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,840
 Living the Kingdom Parable Series.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,780
 A parable is, of course, an earthly story

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,760
 with a heavenly meaning.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,660
 And Pastor Tim has already graciously led us through

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,480
 the parable of the workers in the vineyard

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,640
 and the parables of the lost coin and the lost sheep.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,880
 I'm speaking today about the parable

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,200
 of the Pharisee and the tax collector.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,760
 It is taken from Luke chapter 18,

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,520
 and without further ado, I'd like us to read it.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,320
 To some who were confident of their own righteousness

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,720
 and looked down on everyone else,

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,640
 Jesus told this parable.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,960
 Two men went up to the temple to pray,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,960
 one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,600
 The Pharisee stood by himself and he prayed,

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,200
 God, I thank you that I'm not like other people,

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,480
 robbers, evildoers, adulterers,

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,300
 or even like this tax collector.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,300
 I fast twice a week and I give a 10th of all I get.

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:40,700
 But the tax collector stood at a distance.

27
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,720
 He would not even look up to heaven,

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,940
 but he beat his breast and said,

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,480
 Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:03,040
 I tell you, it was this man rather than the other

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,440
 who went home justified before God.

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,160
 For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,580
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.

34
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,120
 I always think it helps when we study

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,480
 a passage in scripture to see what comes before it

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,680
 and to see what comes after it.

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,680
 I always say, you know, you take a text out of context

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,800
 and all that is left is a con

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,620
 and I'm not here to con you this morning.

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:59,880
 But what I did found interesting as I prepared this week,

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,880
 I discovered that this parable is rather like a bridge

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,680
 and I've put on here, Shenzhen Bay Bridge

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
 just down the road.

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 You see, in the previous chapter, Luke 17,

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,520
 the Pharisees, the religious people were pestering Jesus

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,340
 about the kingdom he had been referring to.

47
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,960
 The kingdom against the backdrop of the oppressive

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,560
 and heartless Roman Empire.

49
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,320
 Jesus had said this,

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,680
 once on being asked by the Pharisees

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,160
 when the kingdom of God would come,

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,720
 Jesus replied, the coming of the kingdom of God

53
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,680
 is not something that can be observed,

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,900
 nor will people say, here it is, there it is,

55
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,800
 because the kingdom of God is in your midst.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,360
 You see, the Pharisees were looking for signs

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,100
 for the coming of the kingdom.

58
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,280
 Jesus tells them not to be looking to signs,

59
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,800
 but to be looking to him.

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,380
 The kingdom of God had already come.

61
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,280
 He was it and they failed to recognize him.

62
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:31,420
 Jesus then turns from the Pharisees to his disciples.

63
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,640
 Remember, he's walking towards Jerusalem

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,440
 where he's going to die on a cross.

65
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,480
 He's gonna raise from the dead and then ascend into heaven.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,920
 It won't be long before all these sweet days

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,040
 of hanging out with Jesus, walking to Jerusalem

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,260
 are going to come to an end for the disciples.

69
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,880
 At the end of this discourse, he tells them two parables.

70
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,280
 The first one is the parable of the persistent widow,

71
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,360
 which we will have to save for another day.

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,000
 But just look how Jesus began it.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,840
 Verse one, chapter 18.

74
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,520
 Then Jesus told his disciples a parable

75
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,040
 to tell them they should always pray,

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,400
 always pray and not give up.

77
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,920
 He then uses the analogy of a persistent widow

78
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,000
 to illustrate the difference

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,280
 between an unjust judge and a just God.

80
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,080
 But you might be asking yourself,

81
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,200
 why have I spent all this time

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
 describing the approach to the road

83
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,040
 rather than the bridge itself?

84
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,860
 To use my Shenzhen Bay Bridge analogy,

85
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,120
 am I enjoying myself in Laofu San eating the seafood

86
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,400
 rather than taking the Shenzhen Bridge?

87
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,420
 I tell you why.

88
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,180
 Because the Pharisees may at this stage

89
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,860
 have put two and two together and made five.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,140
 And they may have concluded

91
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,620
 that long public battling prayers

92
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,940
 would put them on the right road to cross the bridge.

93
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,020
 Follow the rules and you'll be on the right path.

94
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,900
 But what I wanna do now is to skip forward

95
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,980
 to the other side of the bridge.

96
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,340
 Perhaps I'm in Shekho.

97
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,020
 The verses that follow this parable

98
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,060
 and see what we find there.

99
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,340
 Let's move to verse 15.

100
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,980
 And June has already said these words this morning.

101
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,860
 People were also bringing babies to Jesus

102
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,740
 for him to place his hands on them.

103
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,300
 When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,220
 But Jesus called the children to him and said,

105
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,340
 "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them

106
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,900
 "for the kingdom of God belongs to such of them."

107
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,020
 Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive

108
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,020
 the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.

109
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,480
 Anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God

110
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,940
 like a little child would not enter it.

111
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,940
 Now notice, it does not say anyone who has read the Bible

112
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:40,500
 from cover to cover, anyone who prays five times a day,

113
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,860
 attends community group every week,

114
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,820
 and is faithfully tied to the church

115
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,540
 will enter the kingdom of God.

116
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,700
 Now you may not have heard this approach before.

117
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,400
 But the bridge from persistent prayer

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,580
 to childlikeness has apparently come through

119
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,660
 the parable we are studying today.

120
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,780
 You see, the Pharisees could be best described

121
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,860
 as those who trusted in themselves

122
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,980
 and held others in contempt.

123
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,100
 That's what Jesus said.

124
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,460
 Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee,

125
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,540
 the other a tax collector.

126
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,980
 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed,

127
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,380
 "God, I thank you I'm not like other people,

128
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,700
 "robbers, evildoers, adulterers,

129
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,800
 "even like this tax collector.

130
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,980
 "I fast twice a week and give a 10th of all I get."

131
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,820
 I put these verses on the screen again.

132
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,860
 Notice how often he uses the word I.

133
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:06,060
 "God, I thank you that I am not like other people,

134
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,560
 "these various people.

135
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,560
 "I fast twice a week and I give a 10th of all I get."

136
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,380
 Four times in NIV, the word I.

137
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,360
 I went to the ESV this week and it's five times.

138
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,240
 He says, "I give a 10th of all I get."

139
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,860
 Now the Pharisee is saying this,

140
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,840
 "I am not like other men.

141
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:41,880
 "It's all about me, me, me, not me, myself and Irene."

142
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,980
 He is so full of himself.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
 He is doing all the right things.

144
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,180
 And he wants an A plus.

145
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,000
 He wants a gold star.

146
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,380
 He wants a badge of honor.

147
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,080
 We see a lot of this in Hong Kong.

148
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,680
 On reflection, it was fascinating

149
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,620
 that Jesus chose a tax collector

150
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,400
 to compare with the Pharisee.

151
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,440
 If we look elsewhere in the Bible,

152
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,440
 Jesus used the commonly held opinion of tax collectors

153
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,720
 as an illustration of the final stage of church discipline.

154
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:39,140
 When a person is excommunicated, thrown out of the church,

155
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,320
 Jesus said in Matthew 18, 17,

156
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,320
 "To treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."

157
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,560
 In other words, the excommunicant

158
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,520
 is to be considered an outsider

159
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,640
 and a candidate for evangelism.

160
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,280
 Invite them on the Alpha Course.

161
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,360
 By way of background, there are a number of reasons

162
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,920
 for the low view of tax collectors

163
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,760
 in the New Testament era.

164
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,520
 Firstly, no one likes to pay money to the government, right?

165
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,320
 Especially when the government is an oppressive regime

166
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,660
 like the Roman Empire of the first century.

167
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,960
 Those who collected the taxes for such a government

168
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,480
 bore the brunt of much public displeasure.

169
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,640
 Secondly, the tax collectors in the Bible were Jews.

170
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,320
 And they were Jews who were working for the hated Romans.

171
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,800
 These individuals were seen as turncoats,

172
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,560
 traders to their own countrymen.

173
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,900
 Rather than fighting the Roman oppressors,

174
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,460
 the publicans were helping them

175
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,120
 and enriching themselves at the expense of their fellow Jews.

176
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,200
 And thirdly, it was common knowledge

177
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,100
 that the tax collectors cheated the people

178
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,600
 they collected from.

179
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,080
 By hook or by crook, they would collect more than required

180
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
 and keep the extra for themselves.

181
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,280
 Some jacks all right.

182
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:22,480
 Everyone just understood that was how it worked.

183
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
 Remember the tax collector Zacchaeus

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,680
 in his confession to the Lord

185
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,180
 mentioned his past dishonesty.

186
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,360
 But this is where the parable turns itself on its head.

187
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,040
 Verse 13, but the tax collector stood at a distance.

188
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,880
 He wouldn't even look up to heaven,

189
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,600
 but beat his breast, said, God,

190
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,720
 have mercy on me, a sinner.

191
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,420
 Wow.

192
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,240
 Wow.

193
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,680
 Wow.

194
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,560
 Let's pause for a moment and give Jesus the last word.

195
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,060
 I tell you that this man rather than the other

196
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,080
 went home justified before God.

197
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,440
 For those who exalted themselves will be humbled

198
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,440
 and those who humbled themselves will be exalted.

199
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 Let's look at what's happened here.

200
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,280
 The guy who justified himself was humbled.

201
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:55,280
 The guy who humbled himself was justified.

202
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,000
 This my friends is the kingdom of God.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Let me say that again.

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,680
 This my friends is the kingdom of God.

205
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,040
 Now to help us further,

206
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,840
 let me give you a modern version of this parable.

207
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,120
 In the modern version of this parable,

208
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,740
 I chose to call the Pharisee Religious Ron.

209
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,040
 Sorry if there's anyone here called Ron.

210
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,200
 On a given Sunday, Religious Ron

211
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,680
 walked into the church with his head held high

212
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,380
 and his chest out.

213
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,320
 As he walked into the sanctuary,

214
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 Religious Ron spotted the town drug pusher,

215
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:00,760
 the town troublemaker sitting on one of the back pews.

216
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,320
 You wish you hadn't sat on the back pew today, right?

217
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,040
 He had been tried, he'd been found guilty,

218
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,980
 he'd spent time in prison and was recently paroled.

219
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:20,040
 Religious Ron was disgusted to see such a man in church.

220
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:27,600
 So he told the head usher to keep a close watch on the man

221
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,040
 who we will call Larry Lowlife.

222
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,480
 (congregation laughing)

223
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,480
 Larry Lowlife had finally realized he needed

224
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,240
 to change the road on which he'd been traveling.

225
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,080
 He desperately needed God's help and he was in church.

226
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,180
 At the beginning of the pastoral prayer time,

227
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,440
 the pastor always gives at least 30 seconds

228
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,320
 for the congregation to quietly pray

229
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,360
 before he began his prayer.

230
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,980
 Religious Ron's silent prayer was more about

231
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,600
 his own goodness than about his spiritual need.

232
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,240
 Heavenly Father, I thank you that I've been a deacon

233
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
 of this church for more than 20 years.

234
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,000
 Oh, you've blessed my business so much,

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,260
 I'm able to give more of the tithe to the church.

236
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,280
 I haven't missed Sunday service for 10 years

237
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,660
 even when I was sick.

238
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,120
 And you know that I used to sing in the choir.

239
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,120
 I don't smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or cuss on Sundays.

240
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,560
 I don't use or sell drugs like the drug pushing punk

241
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,200
 on one of our back rooms who has the audacity

242
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,120
 after getting out of prison to attend our church today.

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,780
 And Lord, please help our football team.

244
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,320
 That's soccer for US people.

245
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,900
 Help our football team clobber the local Baptist church

246
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,660
 in the church football league on Tuesday night, amen.

247
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,560
 Religious Ron was so full of pride,

248
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,580
 he could strut even when he was sitting down.

249
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:32,440
 Meanwhile, Larry lowlife on one of the back rows

250
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,640
 was praying this.

251
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,100
 God be merciful to me for I'm a sinner.

252
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,760
 I desperately need your help to get my life turned around

253
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,740
 so that I can go in the right direction.

254
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,700
 Lord, please forgive me and cleanse me.

255
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:06,600
 I open my life to you.

256
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,180
 Let me read verse 14 again.

257
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,960
 I tell you it was this man rather than the other

258
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,620
 who went home justified before God.

259
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,240
 For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled

260
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,340
 and those who humble themselves will be exalted.

261
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,080
 Hopefully this modern parable of religious Ron

262
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,160
 and lowlife Larry will help us, you and me,

263
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,200
 to enter the worship services here at the Vine

264
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,160
 with a desire to primarily focus on three things.

265
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
 Firstly, the goodness and the greatness of God.

266
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,120
 Secondly, to genuinely worship him

267
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,620
 by focusing primarily upon your spiritual needs.

268
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,280
 And thirdly, to offer your life,

269
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,320
 to serve him in the ways that bear witness

270
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 of his love to others in specific ways.

271
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,440
 In the original parable of the Pharisee

272
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,020
 and the tax collector, Jesus said,

273
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,120
 there are two attitudes that people

274
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,560
 generally display in worship.

275
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,880
 Number one, I'm proud of my goodness.

276
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,440
 Pride loves to use the personal pronouns I and me.

277
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,320
 It seldom omits a need.

278
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,740
 It does not focus on the needs of others.

279
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:50,720
 Or secondly, I desperately need God's mercy.

280
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,760
 I've got a question for you.

281
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,520
 Which of these two attitudes,

282
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,480
 which of these two attitudes best describes your spirit

283
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,740
 as you enter church on a Sunday morning?

284
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,300
 Before I finish, I wanna push this a stage further

285
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,140
 if you don't mind.

286
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,220
 I wanna get really personal.

287
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,620
 I wanna give you a question.

288
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:24,540
 If you were to die tonight and stand before the Holy God,

289
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:30,980
 on what basis would you seek entrance

290
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,820
 into heaven?

291
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,220
 Think about it, I'm gonna say it again.

292
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,620
 If you were to die tonight and stand before the Holy God,

293
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:51,340
 on what basis would you seek entrance into heaven?

294
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,460
 I mentioned earlier the parable of the persistent widow

295
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,220
 or the ungodly widow.

296
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,940
 The parable of the persistent widow or the unjust judge

297
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,380
 that preceded this parable.

298
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,980
 It ends with the question.

299
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,580
 However, when the Son of Man comes,

300
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,480
 will he find faith on the earth?

301
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,400
 Since now we're getting very serious,

302
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,760
 we're talking about our eternal destinies.

303
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,260
 I cannot think of anything more important

304
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,860
 for us to hear the truth of Jesus' message in this parable.

305
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,460
 You see, if we were to go out from here today

306
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,420
 and ask people in Yoho Mall,

307
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,340
 even those who are regular church goers,

308
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,640
 are you sure of your eternal destiny

309
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,540
 that you'll go to heaven when you die?

310
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,700
 I guarantee that the prevalent answer would be,

311
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,320
 no, I'm not sure.

312
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,660
 If we probe a little bit further and ask them why

313
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,780
 they were not sure.

314
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,060
 We'd probably hear things like,

315
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,020
 I'm not sure I'm good enough.

316
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:11,300
 Reinforcing a widely held belief that somehow,

317
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,420
 somehow our good deeds will be measured up

318
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,740
 against our bad ones on some kind of spiritual scorecard.

319
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,500
 Salvation by KPIs, you might say.

320
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,980
 That we somehow need to earn our way into heaven

321
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,220
 by being good.

322
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:34,440
 Even though we know we are just not able to achieve this.

323
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,780
 The ultimate difficulty that any human being

324
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,300
 will encounter is this.

325
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:49,420
 How can any unjust person in the presence of a just God

326
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,940
 stand at the last judgment?

327
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,280
 (congregation laughing)

328
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:04,460
 The only way, the only way we can stand

329
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,860
 is to be justified.

330
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,720
 To be declared just.

331
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,160
 And when we say that justification is by faith alone,

332
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,260
 that is simple shorthand for justification

333
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,940
 by Jesus Christ alone.

334
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,500
 Faith is the sole instrument by which we can grab hold

335
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,180
 of Christ and his justice is transferred to us.

336
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:38,180
 God imputes or counts the righteousness of Jesus

337
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,920
 to those who put their trust in him.

338
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,260
 But I tell you today,

339
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,780
 if you trust in yourself,

340
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,620
 you stand by yourself.

341
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,620
 The only way you will ever stand before a just

342
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,500
 and holy God is as one clothed in the righteousness

343
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,340
 of Christ.

344
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,820
 You add nothing to it.

345
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:13,820
 Jesus ended this little parable by saying,

346
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,700
 I tell you that this man, the tax collector,

347
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,340
 went home justified before God.

348
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,620
 The man couldn't even look up to heaven.

349
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,780
 He couldn't get near to the holy of holies,

350
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,940
 could only beat his chest and repent in sin,

351
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,020
 plead for the mercy of God and throw himself

352
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,740
 at the mercy of the court.

353
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:47,260
 He walked out the door and went home justified.

354
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,580
 My friends, do not leave here today

355
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:02,580
 until you tell the Lord God almighty that you are a sinner

356
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:08,100
 and cannot stand apart from his mercy and grace.

357
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,300
 If you throw yourself and your soul to him

358
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,900
 and his mercy clinging to Christ,

359
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,380
 you will go home justified.

360
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,740
 Jesus said of the spiritual man, the Pharisee,

361
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:32,060
 the one who came so close, so close to the holy place,

362
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,420
 the tax collector went home justified rather than the other.

363
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:45,900
 The Pharisee went home that day and he continued to tithe

364
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,540
 and he continued to fast.

365
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,340
 But he remained an unjustified person.

366
00:25:53,340 --> 00:26:00,100
 If you were to die tonight and stand before God

367
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,980
 and God said to you, why should I let you into my heaven?

368
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,500
 What would you say?

369
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:15,260
 I hope you would say, because of Jesus.

370
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,340
 Because he's my only hope, I put my trust in him.

371
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,500
 Everything else is sinking sand.

372
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,740
 Then he will look at you.

373
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,500
 He'll say, please come in.

374
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,580
 My son is already here.

375
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,220
 He's prepared a place for you

376
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,380
 that you might bask in his glory now and forevermore.

377
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:58,540
 Let's close our eyes and ask the worship band to come back.

378
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:09,660
 We're gonna be singing that song, Come to the Altar, again.

379
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,540
 I joked about it before I preached the sermon.

380
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,020
 I think the song had already done my sermon for me.

381
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
 It's a middle song.

382
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:23,180
 I want you to use that song

383
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:29,980
 to come back to the altar on your knees before Jesus

384
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,180
 where the place is forgiveness.

385
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,700
 But I wanna give an opportunity right here and now

386
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,420
 for anyone who's here today, a friend may have brought you.

387
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,620
 You may have been coming to church for a while,

388
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,820
 but you've never said,

389
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,060
 Jesus, I want you to be the savior of my life.

390
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,300
 You come here, you love the music,

391
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
 you love the fellowship, the friendship,

392
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:06,180
 but you've never asked Jesus to be the savior of your life,

393
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,220
 trust in him for your salvation.

394
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,380
 Can I tell you it's the only way?

395
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:19,100
 Don't go home from this sermon

396
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,180
 and read the Bible from cover to cover,

397
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,300
 pray for three hours, put on worship music all night

398
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,900
 to try and do things to get close to God.

399
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,860
 None of those things are bad by the way,

400
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,980
 but they are if you think that's the way

401
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,260
 that you're gonna get right with God.

402
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,460
 The only way today that you are gonna get right with God

403
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,500
 is to be like that tax collector.

404
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,140
 Father, I'm a sinner.

405
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,260
 That's not too difficult, we've all sinned.

406
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,620
 We are all sinners.

407
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,620
 Father, I am a sinner, I am in need of your forgiveness.

408
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,500
 And just what every eye is closed

409
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,300
 and please respect this for a moment.

410
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,700
 If there is anyone here

411
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,180
 who wants to pray that prayer for themselves,

412
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,900
 who wants to pray that prayer to say,

413
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,900
 Jesus, I'm a sinner, I need you, come into my life.

414
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,980
 I want you to do something very, very simple,

415
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,500
 just what every eye is closed.

416
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,100
 I'd love to pray for you.

417
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,340
 And just to know who I'm praying for, if that's you,

418
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,660
 I'm gonna ask you one simple thing.

419
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,020
 Just to pop up your hand, raise your hands, thank you.

420
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,740
 Raise your hand.

421
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,340
 This is only if you wanna pray this prayer, right?

422
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,060
 I'm not asking everyone to raise their hands,

423
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,380
 but if that's you, you want to ask Jesus

424
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,100
 into your life this morning.

425
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,780
 You want to say sorry for the things I've done wrong.

426
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:02,660
 If you do that, you go home justified.

427
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,500
 If you die tonight or if you die in 40 years time,

428
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:14,060
 God will have heard your prayer.

429
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,460
 So maybe as a church, we could pray this all together

430
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,620
 just for the people who put their hands up.

431
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,500
 Church, repeat after me, Father God,

432
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,140
 I come before you now,

433
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,460
 I come before you now,

434
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,580
 I recognize that I am a sinner.

435
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,660
 I'm in need of forgiveness.

436
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,260
 Jesus, I believe you're the Son of God.

437
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,260
 You died for me.

438
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,140
 Jesus, forgive my sins.

439
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,580
 Come into my life, fill me with your spirit

440
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,900
 and help me to live a life for you.

441
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,700
 I pray this now in Jesus' name.

442
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,540
 Amen.

443
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,140
 Let's welcome those who's prayed that for the first time.

444
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:11,780
 And church, we all have an opportunity now.

445
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,060
 Don't be thinking now what you're gonna have for lunch,

446
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,180
 where are you gonna go?

447
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,060
 Come to the altar.

448
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,540
 Look at these words as you sing them.

449
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,660
 I could have not preached this sermon

450
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:29,740
 this morning, this chorus does it all for me.

451
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,060
 Look at these words and my friends,

452
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,660
 just come to the altar and say,

453
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:40,660
 Lord, I need your forgiveness.

454
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,340
 Come into my life.

455
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,340
 Let's stand and sing.

456
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,740
 (soft music)

457
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,320
 (gentle music)

458
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,900
 (upbeat music)
