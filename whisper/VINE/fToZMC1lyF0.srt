1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 - Well, good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 - Good morning.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,460
 - Everyone doing okay?

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,300
 - Yeah.

5
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,140
 - Great.

6
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,200
 I brought some things with me today

7
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,440
 that I want to show and tell you guys about.

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,020
 There are two specific things, okay?

9
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,740
 These two things are pretty important to me.

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,800
 They've shaped the way that I see life, myself, God.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,400
 They've been with me for a long time.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,340
 Well, one of them is new.

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,700
 The other's been with me for a very long time.

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,000
 But they've really impacted my perspective.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,200
 These two things are surrounded by two stories,

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,720
 two very distinct contexts and situations

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,900
 in which these two things will find their meaning.

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,680
 So I'm pretty excited to share them with you.

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,760
 One of these things I never, ever share

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,080
 'cause it's quite close to the chest,

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,340
 but it's pretty important.

22
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,460
 So the first thing, I have to roll up my sleeve to show you.

23
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,380
 I have this scar on my arm.

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,280
 It's not a birthmark.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,600
 I actually don't have any birthmarks.

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,800
 I have just a scar.

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,240
 I also took a lovely photo so you guys could see it

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,720
 since you're not super close to me.

29
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,680
 This scar is a reminder.

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,600
 I was born in Monrovia, Liberia in West Africa.

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,960
 In 1990, in the middle of a civil war,

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,060
 my mother, who is a living saint,

33
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,800
 had to endure one of the most horrific civil wars

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,840
 while pregnant.

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,200
 This scar reminds me of God's provision and protection.

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
 See, my mother had many instances,

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,520
 I was talking to her this morning

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,000
 to make sure I got this story right,

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,180
 many instances where she was shot at.

40
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,000
 There was one moment where she was running for her life,

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,760
 eight months pregnant after laying on the floor,

42
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,700
 running for her life.

43
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,400
 And the step that she took, if she hadn't stopped,

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,620
 a bullet would have completely went through her stomach,

45
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,480
 killing her and killing me.

46
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,240
 This was one of many instances

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,680
 where my mother experienced God's provision.

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,600
 Multiple times, the village that we were living in,

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,080
 we were moving from village to village,

50
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,360
 we'd wake up and find that everyone around us

51
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,080
 had been killed except for my family.

52
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,520
 A very ridiculously disgusting and horrific place

53
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,560
 is how I was brought into this world.

54
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,240
 I was brought into this world with no doctors,

55
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,600
 with no hospitals, outside in the rain, in a bush.

56
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,120
 This scar is from one of those stories.

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,460
 And it just reminds me regularly,

58
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,180
 man, God has seen me through.

59
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,080
 I wouldn't physically be here

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,080
 had it not been for the work of God in my life.

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,520
 And it's something that I'm so glad I have this scar

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,880
 because I know God has seen me through,

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,200
 I know God is working for me,

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,100
 but this scar is a physical reminder

65
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,240
 that God is doing impossible things for me.

66
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,320
 He's fighting battles that I can't fight for myself.

67
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,680
 That's my first piece of show and tell.

68
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,840
 I have a second piece that I keep in my wallet.

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,840
 I've kept it with me since July 6th, 2021.

70
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,880
 This is the little thing that they put on babies

71
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
 when they're born.

72
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,960
 My son was born here in Hong Kong on July 6th at a hospital

73
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,520
 and his birth was very different than mine.

74
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,840
 He was actually born in a hospital.

75
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,640
 I was born in a field outside a hospital in a bush,

76
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,000
 very, very different situations.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,360
 He had doctors and midwives.

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,280
 My wife was able to get the epidural

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,760
 so that it wouldn't hurt as bad,

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,620
 still painful, but not as bad.

81
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,820
 Whereas my mother had absolutely nothing.

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,680
 She had no doctors.

83
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,200
 My grandmother was the person that delivered me

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,440
 and had no medical experience whatsoever outside.

85
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,160
 My son was born into a very great situation.

86
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,200
 My wife went into labor and it was intense and it was hard,

87
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,360
 but she got to the hospital at two o'clock that afternoon

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,640
 on July 6th and Elias came out at 4.16 p.m.

89
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,300
 So she had a pretty great, she's very grateful for it,

90
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,400
 a pretty great labor.

91
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
 But I tell you these details in these stories

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,940
 because these two show and tell pieces are very different,

93
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,440
 yet they're connected.

94
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,440
 Like the idea that God would see me through all of this

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,680
 and then allow me to have a kid

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,160
 who I would have never expected,

97
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,920
 my mom who's watching today would have never fathomed

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,480
 that I would live, that I would survive,

99
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,560
 and that I would be able to have a kid who's healthy,

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,840
 who was born in a hospital, who had doctors,

101
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,920
 who my wife was able to be taken care of.

102
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,000
 It's a ridiculous story of the reach of God

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,400
 across multiple generations.

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,300
 And I keep it with me 'cause it's very important.

105
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,000
 These two little details in my life

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,400
 have produced something in me.

107
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,200
 They have shaped the way that I see things.

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,500
 The context around these stories and these specific times

109
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,400
 have impacted me so much that I live in response

110
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,480
 to the revelation that they've created in my life.

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,140
 These circumstances and experiences

112
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,280
 have shaped how I worship.

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,600
 See, God ends up showing us something.

114
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,480
 He showed his faithfulness.

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,200
 He showed that he's good.

116
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,080
 He showed that he can fight battles for me,

117
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,080
 and I can't help but respond by telling of that goodness,

118
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,360
 of speaking of what God is.

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,200
 And when God works in a miraculous way,

120
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,920
 when you see the favor of God,

121
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,000
 can you not but share it, but tell it, but speak it?

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,860
 This show and tell concept is a very basic,

123
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,100
 but it's one of the most fundamental ways

124
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,880
 in which we worship.

125
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,280
 Show and tell worship is oftentimes rooted

126
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,360
 in a specific set of circumstances.

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,640
 Something happened at a certain time

128
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,800
 where it was challenging and God showed up,

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,760
 and we respond to that in our worship.

130
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
 Show and tell worship isn't arbitrary.

131
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,920
 It's deeply rooted.

132
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,760
 It starts off where we note something about God,

133
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
 we observe something about God,

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and it continues as we respond

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,520
 and speak and tell of that thing.

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,200
 This kind of worship is a response to the God that we see.

137
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,960
 We put it in the language that's pretty similar

138
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,680
 to this sermon series.

139
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,760
 And Pastor Andrew has been asking us the question

140
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,320
 throughout this series, what will we see?

141
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,840
 What will we see?

142
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,640
 God is doing a new thing, but will we see it?

143
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,080
 See, if our worship can be a response to what God is doing,

144
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,760
 then we have to be able to see the new thing God is doing.

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,360
 Will we see it?

146
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,440
 Seeing that new thing that God is doing,

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,400
 unfortunately, isn't always easy.

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,000
 So the passage that we've been studying,

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
 we've been rooted around this passage in Isaiah,

150
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,800
 and the context of what these people's lives were

151
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,160
 were pretty frustrating.

152
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,040
 They once were a kingdom that was sufficient,

153
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,440
 that was ruling at the height of their level,

154
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,000
 and they now live exiled from their kingdom,

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,520
 destroyed homes, burnt city, temple, completely ransacked.

156
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,680
 They've got nothing.

157
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,960
 It's like God is far away while they're in a foreign land.

158
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,040
 They've heard situations, and they know the stories,

159
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,080
 they have the scriptures of where God parted the Red Seas,

160
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,120
 four people, but God hasn't parted their Red Sea yet.

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,040
 They're still stuck in exile.

162
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,000
 It feels like they're defeated.

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,320
 It feels like God is distant, like God is silent,

164
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,560
 and they're wondering will we ever see the good days again?

165
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,200
 And it's in this context,

166
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 it's in this stuck, frustrating exile context

167
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,640
 that God speaks to the prophet of Isaiah saying,

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,440
 guys, behold, I'm about to do something new.

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,280
 I'm doing something new, something different than before.

170
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,600
 Do you perceive it?

171
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,680
 Can you see it?

172
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,440
 Or better yet, will you see it?

173
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,400
 And Isaiah, throughout all of these verses

174
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
 that we've been studying, has shown us

175
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,600
 that there's multiple things that prevent us

176
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,240
 from being able to see that very new thing

177
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,920
 that God has for his people,

178
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,320
 that very new thing that we're so desperate of.

179
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,880
 We have a hard time seeing for multiple reasons.

180
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,240
 Week one, we talked about how in the past,

181
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,920
 when God has worked in such a miraculous way,

182
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,760
 we sometimes limit him in our mind,

183
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,880
 expecting him to part Red Seas

184
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,160
 when he's ready to send the Messiah to save all of humanity.

185
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,880
 Our limitations can be a barrier between us seeing

186
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,920
 the very thing that God has for us.

187
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,240
 In week two, we looked at how our fasting

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,160
 and our response to God is not just a ritualistic thing.

189
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,120
 It's not just about depriving yourself of food

190
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,760
 or of Instagram or of whatever you choose to fast,

191
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,160
 but instead, God is calling us into a fast of justice,

192
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,540
 a fast of love where we provide for those around us

193
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,200
 a new kind of fast.

194
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,560
 And in week three, Pastor Andrew did this weird

195
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,640
 and disgusting illustration with water

196
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,000
 and with soy sauce and all this nasty stuff.

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,160
 And he showed us what our sin looks like,

198
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,680
 how it ruins our ability to see clearly.

199
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,280
 And he showed us that because we couldn't look

200
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,680
 through the glass and see clearly.

201
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,080
 And he showed us what happens when we deal with our sin

202
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
 and we bring our sin before God,

203
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,640
 which is something that separates us from seeing him.

204
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,760
 The Holy Spirit comes in and the water went

205
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,320
 into the little tub thingy and it poured out

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,520
 and the water got cleaner and cleaner and cleaner.

207
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,280
 Not perfect, but very, very, very clean

208
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,800
 to the point where we were finally able to see.

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
 Illustration being that our sin can block us

210
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
 from seeing the truth of who God is.

211
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,880
 And then this week, we kind of turn the page a little bit.

212
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,120
 We kind of pivot a little bit.

213
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,960
 This week, Isaiah is calling us to see something new,

214
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,400
 to understand and perceive something a little different.

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,060
 So I'm gonna take us straight to the text,

216
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,880
 looking at Isaiah 42, verses 10 through 13.

217
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,080
 And it reads like this.

218
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,160
 Sing to the Lord a new song,

219
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,680
 his praise from the end of the earth.

220
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,620
 You who go down to the sea and all that is in it,

221
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,600
 you islands and all who live in them.

222
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,440
 Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voice.

223
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
 Let the settlements where Kadar lives rejoice.

224
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
 Let the people of Selah sing for joy.

225
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,320
 Let them shout from the mountaintops.

226
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,000
 Let them give glory to the Lord

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,760
 and proclaim his praise in the islands.

228
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,440
 The Lord will march out like a champion,

229
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,480
 like a warrior he will stir up zeal.

230
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,400
 With the shout, he will raise the battle cry

231
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
 and will triumph over his enemies.

232
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,120
 Isaiah is going to use this passage to show us

233
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
 that God is actually calling his people into something new.

234
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,320
 But it's something new that's somewhat similar

235
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,920
 to what they are used to.

236
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,040
 It's a new type of singing.

237
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
 He's calling them to sing a new song,

238
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,400
 inviting them into a new worship.

239
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,160
 So he says, he opens it with this.

240
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,900
 Sing to the Lord a new song.

241
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,240
 He doesn't say sing a more happy song.

242
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,400
 He says, sing a new song.

243
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,840
 Could have said sing a praise song or more upbeat song,

244
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,680
 but he says, sing a new song.

245
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,720
 And if our worship can be a response

246
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,480
 to the situation in the context,

247
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,680
 perhaps Isaiah is saying that sing of a new circumstance

248
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,720
 that your God is about to lead you into.

249
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,640
 Because there's a new moment of God acting

250
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,420
 on the behalf of his people on the horizon.

251
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,320
 If they could just see it,

252
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
 if we could just see that God is still acting,

253
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
 that God is acting for us, that he is working for us,

254
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,680
 it would erupt in us something new.

255
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
 A new song would come from our mouth.

256
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,860
 He says, sing to the Lord a new song.

257
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,000
 And this idea of singing is something

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
 that we do quite often in church,

259
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,880
 where we sing songs, it comes from our lips.

260
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,320
 And that's what Isaiah is speaking about.

261
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,080
 The words that we sing, the words that we say,

262
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,880
 the words that come out of our mouths,

263
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,840
 sing of the goodness and the newness

264
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,240
 of what God has for us.

265
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,580
 This idea of singing is just a component

266
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,580
 of the show and tell concept of worship.

267
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,140
 It's the telling part of it.

268
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,920
 And show and tell, just let me break it down

269
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,140
 in case it's something you've never experienced.

270
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,000
 Show and tell is this cute little thing

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,740
 that kids do in school or in classes

272
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,340
 where they bring a fluffy little bunny

273
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,160
 and they're like, hi, this is my fluffy bunny.

274
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,060
 It's really important to me.

275
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,180
 And I cuddle with it.

276
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,020
 And they're trying to help their friends

277
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,780
 understand and perceive and value

278
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,420
 something that they would have not naturally done.

279
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,140
 And in show and tell worship,

280
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,140
 God does this showing and we get to do this telling.

281
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,820
 It's a delicate balance in showing and telling.

282
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,940
 God has his job.

283
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,140
 Like I shared in my story, God shows his faithfulness.

284
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,580
 He shows his goodness and we have a role.

285
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,180
 And in our role, we get to respond to that goodness,

286
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,060
 to that faithfulness, to the things that he's done.

287
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,900
 And the response that Isaiah is telling them to give

288
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,220
 is one of their mouth in verse 10.

289
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,260
 He says, sing a new song, sing a new song.

290
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,140
 Songs, words that come from our mouth.

291
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,500
 And here at the Vine, we do that every Sunday, right?

292
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,940
 We have the normal set of stuff, some announcements.

293
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,580
 We do tithing, then we go into a singing time.

294
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,140
 The words that come out of our mouth, sing songs.

295
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,820
 And in those moments on Sundays

296
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,580
 when we get a chance to sing songs, they're super important.

297
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,220
 Because in those moments, our mouths get to confess

298
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,220
 and speak of realities that sometimes we forget.

299
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,580
 We get a chance together corporately

300
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,180
 to declare of God's goodness, of his faithfulness,

301
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,480
 that God is loving and kind and full of compassion.

302
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,900
 What we're doing are giving testimonies

303
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,940
 of who God has been, the things that he has done.

304
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,860
 God is faithful because he did a certain thing.

305
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,300
 God has stood with us, God has taken care of us,

306
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,620
 he has carried us through.

307
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,100
 We sing these songs about the goodness of God

308
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,580
 and the things that he has done for us,

309
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,580
 testifying of what God has done.

310
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,340
 This is one of the dimensions of what our worship looks like.

311
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,660
 We sing because God has done something and we respond to it.

312
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,900
 And I think this paradigm of us singing and responding

313
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,680
 to what God has done works.

314
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,260
 It's good for us to respond to God.

315
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,820
 That's a good kind of worship.

316
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,060
 That's the worship that we should be engaging in.

317
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,780
 But I think the question we have to ask ourselves

318
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,420
 is what happens when we feel like

319
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,240
 we have nothing to respond to?

320
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,140
 What happens when your story isn't like mine?

321
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,820
 What happens when you're still stuck in the moment

322
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,700
 where your troubles haven't been overcome yet?

323
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,820
 When you're still facing mountains?

324
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,180
 How do you respond to what you've not seen yet?

325
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,520
 It's easy to respond when God has done the big,

326
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,500
 but when you're still in exile, which these people were,

327
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,900
 how do you then sing this new song of hope?

328
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,100
 And what Isaiah is doing here is he's inviting the people

329
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,200
 to understand worship in a new way, a new understanding.

330
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,220
 He's wanting them to understand that worship

331
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,920
 is not only rooted in what God has done before,

332
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,920
 but a worship can exist when we haven't seen God move yet,

333
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,260
 when we haven't seen God speak in a long time.

334
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,480
 Isaiah is about to show them that worship can exist

335
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,100
 when God has been silent.

336
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,660
 Worship can bring something forth,

337
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,780
 not just respond to something.

338
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,600
 This kind of worship is new.

339
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,340
 This kind of song, it's new.

340
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,120
 It's a worship not rooted in who God was,

341
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,140
 but a worship rooted in who God is and who God will be.

342
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,420
 It's prophetic worship.

343
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,740
 Isaiah's saying, look, there's all these reasons.

344
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,220
 In the passage, he gives them all these reasons,

345
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,620
 so many reasons to sing a new song.

346
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,620
 It hasn't happened yet.

347
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,840
 He's speaking of future things,

348
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,920
 but look, the idea is that God is going to.

349
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,200
 God isn't far away.

350
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
 God isn't stuck in yesteryear.

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
 So he writes it like this.

352
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
 The Lord will, key word here, will.

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,520
 The Lord will march out like a champion.

354
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,600
 Like a warrior, he will stir up his zeal.

355
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,680
 With a shout, he will raise a battle cry

356
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,080
 and will triumph over his enemies.

357
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,320
 Isaiah is highlighting a promise.

358
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,600
 What God is going to do is going to be incredible,

359
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,620
 but beyond that, the hope is built on the fact

360
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,280
 that God will do something.

361
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,980
 Verses 14 and 15 hammer this point even further.

362
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,180
 It says, I will lay waste to the mountains and hills.

363
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,000
 I will turn rivers into islands.

364
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,560
 I will lead the blind by ways they do not know.

365
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,780
 I will guide them.

366
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,360
 I will turn darkness into light before them.

367
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,660
 These things I will do.

368
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,080
 I will not forsake them.

369
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,920
 This word, this verb, will,

370
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
 speaking of something that's going to happen,

371
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,920
 takes place 15 times over that five verses.

372
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,160
 Like that's the key word, will, will, will, will.

373
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,600
 God isn't just the things he did.

374
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,880
 God will, he will, he will for his people.

375
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,600
 Isaiah is saying that God is making a clear statement.

376
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,720
 He is not simply the God of the past.

377
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,560
 Please hear this.

378
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,360
 His best days are not behind him.

379
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,480
 So sing a new song because God is active,

380
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,320
 because God is at work.

381
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,320
 Our living hope is still alive.

382
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,280
 He's still doing things now and he's still going to do.

383
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,240
 He will do things in the future.

384
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,880
 So we can sing a new song prophetically

385
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,580
 of the things that he will do.

386
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:22,080
 So how does that work with us in Hong Kong, not in exile?

387
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,000
 Well, we've been in this conversation,

388
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,520
 in this tension about the past three years.

389
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,880
 Has anyone heard that phrase before?

390
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,240
 The last three years, it should be pretty familiar, right?

391
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,000
 COVID happened, everything went crazy.

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,480
 The last three years has been stressful.

393
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,920
 It's been challenging.

394
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,420
 There's been battles and difficulties for everyone.

395
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,420
 So I don't want to gloss over it.

396
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,520
 Like it's not an important aspect of our lives.

397
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,680
 There was, there were challenges.

398
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,060
 There were lots of struggles, but while all that is true,

399
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,460
 this is, this is the key.

400
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,800
 God is calling us to sing a new song,

401
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,520
 a new song over Hong Kong, over his city,

402
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,280
 for his church to sing a new song,

403
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,280
 a song looking ahead to a God who fights for his people,

404
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,120
 to a God who is working for his people,

405
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,100
 a song of hope that he will be our light.

406
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,840
 Next year and tomorrow and the next day to come,

407
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,240
 God will be working for us.

408
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,580
 It's not just that the past three years has been challenging

409
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,400
 but there is a God who is still good,

410
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,720
 who is still on the throne,

411
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,500
 and he is still working on the behalf

412
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,140
 of every single one of us here in this city.

413
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,440
 God is for his people.

414
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,120
 He will not forsake us.

415
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,760
 He will do these things for us.

416
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,980
 So if you're in here and the past three years

417
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,020
 has been absolutely ridiculous

418
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,560
 and you're still stuck in that,

419
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,840
 can I just speak some hope that there is still a God

420
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
 that's fighting on your behalf

421
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,800
 and your future is still bright.

422
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,680
 He still has plans for you.

423
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,980
 If you're here and you're in broken relationships,

424
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,340
 perhaps you're in broken family dynamics

425
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,620
 where things are deeply unhealthy,

426
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,780
 can I tell you that God's best days aren't behind him?

427
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,300
 God can still work and move even in your life.

428
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,620
 Now he can, now he will.

429
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,540
 Because we serve a God of the will,

430
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,340
 not just a God of the has.

431
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,660
 And the hope we have in God is for today

432
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,260
 and it's for tomorrow.

433
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,380
 See, that's why the worship staff, Emma and Jethro,

434
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,140
 sang the song that they sang today.

435
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,260
 One of the songs that they actually wrote

436
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,860
 for us as a congregation,

437
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,400
 the words to that song are super important.

438
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,700
 It fits perfectly well with this sermon.

439
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,900
 It says, "Hallelujah, praise the one who was,

440
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,800
 "acknowledging that God has done great things."

441
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,840
 We can testify to that.

442
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,620
 But also, "Hallelujah, praise the one who is."

443
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,020
 God is still here, still moving, still working today.

444
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,660
 And it ends with, "Hallelujah, he'll forever."

445
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,580
 Forever, that means tomorrow,

446
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,180
 that means the next hurdle you face,

447
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,540
 that means the next big global thing that comes,

448
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,540
 that means the next challenging situation.

449
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,860
 God will forever be with us.

450
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,340
 He will forever be our God.

451
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,580
 Our hope hasn't run out.

452
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,980
 Our hope is not stuck in the pre-COVID days.

453
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,220
 Our hope is here and now

454
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,980
 because we can sing a new song of hope

455
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,540
 because God is still working.

456
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,140
 - Yeah, right.

457
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:27,180
 - But for us to sing a new song,

458
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,260
 there has to be a shift, there has to be a bit of a change,

459
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,500
 and a shift in our worship.

460
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,980
 And I wanna be careful,

461
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,080
 I don't wanna say a correction in our worship

462
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,380
 because our other way of worshiping isn't incorrect.

463
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,500
 Hear this, a shift in our worship

464
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,080
 'cause God gives us a song for every season.

465
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,900
 The people of Israel, they had experienced many seasons,

466
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,440
 some highs and some lows, and their songs had changed

467
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,140
 when they were in these moments of deep anguish

468
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,220
 where they were exiled and they were frustrated

469
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,820
 and they were at their rock bottom

470
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,780
 where they felt like it couldn't get any worse.

471
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,060
 They had songs for that.

472
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,540
 God, they were laments.

473
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,500
 And they worshiped God through lamenting,

474
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,300
 lamenting being such a gift of the scripture,

475
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,620
 so much so that we have a whole book

476
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,260
 titled Lamentations of these songs,

477
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,500
 of these worship moments from Israel to God.

478
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,060
 Laments are basically these songs of sorrow

479
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,940
 expressing grief, expressing disappointment,

480
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,120
 expressing regret.

481
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,140
 Laments have seasons, and we have seasons

482
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,420
 where these lament songs can bring so much comfort,

483
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,060
 and I think I'm not alone when I say

484
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,660
 that it has been a comforting thing for us

485
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,860
 over the past three years.

486
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,120
 [sniffles]

487
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,940
 These songs are right for a season,

488
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,580
 but these songs are not the song

489
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,920
 God is calling us to sing in the new season.

490
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,260
 See, he's doing something new.

491
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
 Will we see it?

492
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,100
 Will we sing of the new he is doing?

493
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,420
 See, Isaiah is writing and saying

494
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,300
 we must shift the way that we worship.

495
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,580
 He's saying that God is shifting Israel

496
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,340
 out of laments and into praise,

497
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,300
 and I believe God is shifting the church in Hong Kong

498
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,700
 out of the lament of the past three years

499
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,380
 and into something bright and beautiful,

500
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,260
 into an expression of God

501
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,140
 where his presence fills this place,

502
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,660
 where there's revival in this city,

503
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,480
 where people come to know God,

504
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,580
 where there is goodness in the land.

505
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,940
 He has that for us, but we're never gonna see it

506
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,960
 if we're still singing the old songs,

507
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,140
 if we're not looking for his goodness,

508
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,380
 if we're not looking ahead.

509
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,540
 You can't sing the old songs in the new season.

510
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,300
 See, God's not shaming our laments.

511
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,420
 He's not saying don't lament.

512
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,780
 He's not saying get over it,

513
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,280
 but he's saying let me trade you.

514
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,660
 You have sorrow, bring it to me.

515
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,760
 I'll exchange it.

516
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,900
 Let me trade your shame and your guilt.

517
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,780
 Let me trade your disappointment and your regret for hope,

518
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,860
 for something new, for something to build upon.

519
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,860
 That is the promise that he's bringing us,

520
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,780
 and the question is will we see it?

521
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,180
 Will we look even if we can't see?

522
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,340
 Will we look with the eyes of our heart?

523
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,720
 Will we look in faith, believing in God himself?

524
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,520
 Will we see?

525
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,860
 So worship requires us to shift,

526
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,140
 shift out of the laments and into praise,

527
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,620
 but that's still not a complete understanding of worship.

528
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,020
 Even if we sing the newest songs, right?

529
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,860
 Sing a new song.

530
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,420
 This title is a new song.

531
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,940
 If we sing the new songs every week, every Sunday,

532
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,020
 if we come in here, we worship our guts out,

533
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,020
 hands in the air, people, hands on the knees,

534
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,740
 band going on over and over and singing for 30 minutes,

535
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,060
 45 minutes, an hour, if we do that,

536
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,660
 our worship can still be incomplete.

537
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,560
 Did you know that?

538
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,480
 Our worship can still be flat.

539
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,300
 It can still be empty if our worship

540
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,660
 just stays in our mouths.

541
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,660
 This is a serious risk in churches as a whole,

542
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,740
 to speak of what God is doing

543
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,100
 and to think that a new song is acceptable in worship.

544
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,620
 That error occurs when we relegate worship

545
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,620
 to just the stuff that happens on the stage

546
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,160
 with the band and the piano and the pads and the drums.

547
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,900
 That happens when we relegate worship

548
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,820
 to just the times that we have Emma and Jethro and Kay

549
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,680
 and whoever leading us in worship.

550
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,780
 The moment that the band steps off stage,

551
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,880
 worship isn't over.

552
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,200
 Worship doesn't end because the song has ended.

553
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,520
 Actually, I dare say that more worship takes place

554
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,040
 Monday to Saturday, not just here on Sunday.

555
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,200
 Worship that comes from just our mouths

556
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,480
 can easily become the worship that God rejects.

557
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,600
 And he would say that, right?

558
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,960
 Jesus would quote Isaiah a couple hundred years later.

559
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,440
 He would say this, "These people honor me with their lips.

560
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,920
 "They honor me with their songs.

561
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,940
 "Their new songs are great.

562
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,820
 "They honor me with it.

563
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,760
 "They sing the right words, but their hearts,"

564
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,220
 ah, their hearts, "are far from me."

565
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,440
 So in Isaiah, he would put it like this in verse 15,

566
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,760
 continuing in this story.

567
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,980
 He would say, "Yes, God is gonna be a warrior.

568
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,400
 "He's gonna rescue his people.

569
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,660
 "He's gonna fight for you guys.

570
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,480
 "There is hope.

571
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,440
 "You can believe in that.

572
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,560
 "You can take that to the bank.

573
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,400
 "God is good.

574
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 "He's going to rescue.

575
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,120
 "He's gonna do all these great things."

576
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,820
 But he ends such a hopeful text

577
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,720
 with this one sentence.

578
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,980
 He says this, "But those who trust in idols,

579
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,840
 "who say to images, 'You are our gods,'

580
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,660
 "will be turned back in utter shame."

581
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,100
 What's Isaiah saying?

582
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,480
 God's gonna do all these great things.

583
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
 He's gonna come and he's gonna fight for his people.

584
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,340
 Hurrah, there's hope there.

585
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,560
 He's gonna be a warrior.

586
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,760
 He's gonna rescue us.

587
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,640
 But that hope and the boldness and the peace

588
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,340
 that it brings to our reality is only ours.

589
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,560
 It can only be felt and transform us

590
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,360
 like a new song is meant to do

591
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,280
 if we put our faith in him.

592
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,740
 If our trust is in him,

593
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,860
 which means that worship must include

594
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,540
 what we do with our faith,

595
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,940
 not just what we say with our words.

596
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,520
 True worship is not just about singing.

597
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,340
 True worship is about surrender.

598
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,940
 True worship includes where you put your faith.

599
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,220
 And the temptation when sin is blocking us,

600
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,440
 when things are difficult,

601
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,020
 is to sing of a new song

602
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,460
 and sing of all the hope that God has for us

603
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,060
 while putting our faith in lesser gods,

604
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,780
 even the good things around us,

605
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,340
 placing and building our faith on that.

606
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,740
 Worshiping creation,

607
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,480
 worshiping the things that God has given us

608
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,980
 more than we worship him,

609
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,560
 which is an easy, slippery slope.

610
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,240
 Isaiah is saying that the worship God is looking for

611
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,960
 is holistic.

612
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,000
 It's gotta be both.

613
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,880
 It's gotta be both what we say and what we do.

614
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,200
 Worship with our heart and our soul.

615
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
 Yes, our words, our minds, our strength,

616
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
 with how we live.

617
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,440
 Worship that incorporates our words and our trust

618
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,720
 because honestly, what's the alternative?

619
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,160
 Building your hope and putting your faith in something else,

620
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,840
 in lesser gods and idols,

621
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
 in anything other than God

622
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,840
 is literally setting yourself up for failure.

623
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
 It's a ticking time bomb

624
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,440
 because the reality is the hope that it's meant for us

625
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,200
 to put in our faith, that we're meant to put in God,

626
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,040
 can never be secure in anything else.

627
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,100
 So that means no matter how good your family is,

628
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,880
 you can't build your hope on that.

629
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,420
 It means no matter how good your job might be now,

630
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,720
 you can't build your hope on that.

631
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,480
 Whatever you think you need to reach

632
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,240
 to reach financial stability,

633
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,720
 you can't build your hope on that.

634
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,920
 A specific political climate,

635
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,480
 you can't build your hope on that.

636
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,320
 You know why?

637
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,640
 Because those things were never meant to be

638
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,880
 where our hope and our trust is built.

639
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,520
 But Christ alone, the words we say in Christ alone,

640
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,280
 my hope, my strength, that's where our hope is.

641
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,680
 When we worship completely, yes, we say the words,

642
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,920
 but then we place our trust in him

643
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,640
 because only he can satisfy, only he can deliver.

644
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,560
 No lesser God can do what only God can do.

645
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,160
 So to worship is to put ourselves back in his hands

646
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,400
 and it's to do it daily, to do it regularly.

647
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,000
 It's not a one-time thing.

648
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,700
 Perhaps the most famous passage in the Bible about worship

649
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,000
 from most worship pastors comes from Romans 12.

650
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,720
 It says this, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,

651
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,920
 "in view of God's mercy,

652
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,320
 "in light of what you've seen of him,

653
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,200
 "offer your bodies as a living sacrifice."

654
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,480
 Key word here, living.

655
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
 Doesn't mean that you do it one time and it's over.

656
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,080
 Living things has to repeat,

657
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,560
 it has to be something you do over and over and over again.

658
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,360
 True and proper worship, according to this passage by Paul,

659
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,480
 includes the consistent offering of yourselves,

660
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,040
 of ourselves to God.

661
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,320
 It's not something we do once.

662
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,320
 It's a living sacrifice, much like he is our living hope.

663
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,960
 It's to offer ourselves to God today and tomorrow.

664
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,200
 Every day that we have breath must be how,

665
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,560
 a day for us to engage in this kind of worship.

666
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,320
 And if this is what true and proper worship is,

667
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,540
 then worship can't end at 1230.

668
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,280
 Worship can't end when the band finishes.

669
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,480
 Worship has to be, you're gonna be breathing tomorrow.

670
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,640
 You're gonna be around people,

671
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,520
 you're gonna be given a chance.

672
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,480
 I think what God is saying, this new song that he has,

673
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,120
 don't fall for just half worship

674
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,480
 when he has a whole thing for you.

675
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,560
 And the whole includes the Monday through the Saturday,

676
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,940
 where you put your trust.

677
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,120
 Where you put your trust matters.

678
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,000
 God has a new song for us to sing,

679
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,360
 a new worship that's meant to build you,

680
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,560
 it's meant to equip you, it's meant to fill you with hope,

681
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,140
 give you a future.

682
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,780
 It's meant to be a song for us as a people,

683
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,060
 us as a church, us as a city,

684
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,540
 to see what God is doing.

685
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,180
 If we could just see it, the anticipation in us

686
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,500
 would have us going crazy with hope, crazy with joy,

687
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,200
 because God is still working, God is still acting,

688
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,700
 God is still doing, he's still mending hearts,

689
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,260
 he's still healing relationships,

690
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,060
 he's still doing above and beyond the things

691
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,700
 that we could ever imagine.

692
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,220
 The question is, will we see it?

693
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,460
 Will we see it?

694
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,580
 I think there are two kinds of people here today.

695
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,980
 Actually, the band can go ahead and come up at this point.

696
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,140
 There are two of us in the room today.

697
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,180
 There's two different groups.

698
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,220
 There's one group of us who are, if we're honest,

699
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,580
 we're really struggling to see God,

700
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,140
 because all we see are the mountains around us.

701
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,180
 It sounds like a very easy thing to do

702
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,860
 when you're living in green pastures and everything's okay,

703
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,960
 but if you're someone who is dealing

704
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,740
 with deep financial struggles

705
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,180
 and you don't know what next this year looks like,

706
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,920
 perhaps it becomes very, very more challenging.

707
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,280
 Maybe it's because the relationships are still broken,

708
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,380
 so it's hard to see God.

709
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,500
 You have these circumstances that seem impossible.

710
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,860
 Maybe it's a marriage that's literally hanging by a thread.

711
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,420
 How do you see God in that?

712
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,900
 Here's the good news.

713
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,800
 This is why this passage is so powerful.

714
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,780
 This is why this series is so powerful.

715
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,740
 That might be your current existing reality,

716
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,100
 but there's a new that God has.

717
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,500
 There's a new song that he wants to sing over us.

718
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,900
 There's a new song he's calling you to sing.

719
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,260
 There's a song of hope because God is your God.

720
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,460
 God still fights for you, so if it feels impossible,

721
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,940
 he's good at those kinds of things.

722
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,820
 That's his specialty.

723
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,180
 The challenging things that you feel

724
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,900
 like you can't find an answer to, God can.

725
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,500
 God can do, and he's calling you to bring your anxiety,

726
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,380
 bring your fear, bring the battles that you can't win,

727
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,420
 and watch him guide you through it.

728
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,980
 Maybe you'll never get to see the fullness of that,

729
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,640
 but he will walk with you, he will be your God,

730
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,380
 he will go before you, and he will fight battles

731
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,400
 on your behalf.

732
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,140
 There's a second group of us here today

733
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,380
 who God is calling us just to open our eyes.

734
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,860
 See, show and tell worship is this idea

735
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,200
 that we tell of what God is doing,

736
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,500
 but we'll never tell of what God is doing for some of us

737
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,580
 if we don't look around.

738
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,920
 See, it's not just a future thing of hope,

739
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,700
 God is doing things now.

740
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,380
 Like in this room, I'm convinced that God has worked

741
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,820
 in crazy ways.

742
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,980
 There are stories just like mine,

743
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,500
 there are stories all around here of God providing,

744
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,540
 of God comforting, of God speaking and reminding us,

745
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,760
 and if we could hear them, if we could look and see them,

746
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,700
 what faith that would do to our community,

747
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,380
 what faith that would build in us,

748
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,340
 and we'd be reassured again, we'd stand up tall,

749
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,980
 confident as a people, that our God is active,

750
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,860
 our God is now.

751
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,820
 And so that group of people,

752
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,380
 he's calling you to open your eyes,

753
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,160
 be in community, talk to one another,

754
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,280
 share of the good that God is doing,

755
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,420
 because you don't know how your words,

756
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,060
 your testimony of God's faithfulness in your life

757
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,600
 can bring hope to a dire situation.

758
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,540
 It's a new song, God has a new for us.

759
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,740
 He's calling us to see with our hearts,

760
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,980
 or to see with our eyes,

761
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,080
 either way he's gonna lead us through.

762
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,120
 He's got something for all of us here,

763
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,980
 but will we align ourselves to that?

764
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,300
 Will we see it?

765
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,900
 That's the question, that's the call.

766
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,340
 So why don't we stand and we'll pray together.

767
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,340
 God, we thank you for your goodness,

768
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,820
 we thank you for, I mean, the scriptures are just full

769
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,940
 of all the things that you have done.

770
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,060
 You've done so much in the past,

771
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,660
 even in our lives we have stories of the things you've done,

772
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,300
 you've done so much, you've gotten us this far,

773
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,840
 we thank you for that.

774
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,380
 But God, if this word is true,

775
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,620
 then that means that you are doing things even now.

776
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,900
 And so God, give us the strength to hold to that promise

777
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,820
 that our God isn't stuck in yesterday.

778
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,260
 Our God isn't the God of the past,

779
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,500
 but he's a God of today and tomorrow.

780
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,300
 God, give us the strength,

781
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,220
 give us the courage to see your work around us.

782
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,120
 God, for those of us who don't have the ability to see,

783
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,240
 will you give us eyes and our hearts, God?

784
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,360
 May we see by your spirit,

785
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,820
 may you strengthen the areas that are weak.

786
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,700
 God, for those of us who just need to know

787
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,820
 of the other testimonies, will you loosen our lips, God?

788
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,100
 May we be a people that speak, that sing of your goodness,

789
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,320
 that tell of your goodness, may it inspire one another,

790
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,120
 may others be filled with hope,

791
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,620
 hearing about a God that's still active,

792
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,780
 a God that's still working.

793
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,420
 God, we're not stuck in the past three years, God,

794
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,580
 we declare that new things are coming for this city.

795
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,740
 We declare that new things are coming for your people,

796
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,380
 and you're going to lead us forward,

797
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,080
 that you will still be our God,

798
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,420
 no matter what obstacles come,

799
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,380
 and life can be good because you are good

800
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,100
 and you are with us.

801
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,060
 So God, show us how to hold on to that.

802
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,100
 Show us how to hold on to you as we walk forward,

803
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,780
 as we shift our worship, as we shift our words,

804
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,500
 and as we place our trust in you daily,

805
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
 will you be glorified in our lives,

806
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,540
 and may we see the new that you have for us.

807
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,760
 It's in Jesus' name, amen.

808
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:06,760
