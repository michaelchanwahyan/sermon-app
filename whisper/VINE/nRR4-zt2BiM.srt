1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 One more.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 That was very convincing.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,600
 Well, hey, listen, I want to talk about the elephant in the room.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,040
 I cut my hair.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,040
 We've noticed.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,040
 Yeah, we've noticed.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,960
 And in this hair cutting adventure, I've heard some rumors.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,360
 So we're going to address the rumors today.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,720
 There have been some speculation as to why I cut my hair, and I want to make sure before

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,840
 I dive into God's word that I am up front with you and we clear the air.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,600
 So the first rumor is that it was a wig.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,880
 Y'all, listen, this was real hair.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
 It took me four to five years to grow it.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,840
 Okay, I've got pictures of the whole journey.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,000
 They were natural dreads.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 They were beautiful, but I did cut them.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,200
 So they were real, not a wig.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,840
 Second rumor, this one tickles me, was that I'm going through a midlife crisis.

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,880
 Y'all, come on.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,760
 I'm younger than Allison, right?

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,160
 Like, come on.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,160
 I'm still like vibrant.

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,720
 You know, I'm 34.

24
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,640
 I've got so much left ahead of me.

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
 So no, I did not cut my hair because I'm going through a midlife crisis, and my hair is real.

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,960
 It has not been a wig, but maybe it's not a bad idea if I want to bring it back.

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,440
 Okay, Emma says no.

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
 Whatever.

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,760
 Let me explain to you the reason I cut my hair, because it's, you know, just so you

30
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,840
 know, because I think once we know that, we can stop worrying about that and actually

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,080
 focus on God's word.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,600
 My wife and I had a daughter back in June this past year, little Remy, and I love being

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 a dad.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 This is my second kid.

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
 My first one is Elias, the perfect little boy.

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,640
 And I have the perfect little girl, Remy.

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:40,320
 And I am about 99,000% convinced that my daughter thought my dreads were her father.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
 Let me explain this to you.

39
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,800
 So I, you know, her being tiny and a baby, you know, I look over her and I see her, and

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,680
 every time I would see her, I would talk to her, and I would be animated, and I would

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,440
 smile, we'd be making eye contact.

42
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,880
 And I realized at some point that actually I'm making eye contact with her, but she's

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 looking a little higher.

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,440
 And so I would like swing my dreads and just watch her eyes go there, and I'd like move

45
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
 over here.

46
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
 And my dreads were quite long.

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,000
 And I realized she loved my dreads.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,960
 She thought her father were these beautiful dreadlocks that I had.

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
 And I refuse to let anything come between me and my daughter.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So I cut them.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And that's the story.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So they're gone.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 They're not coming back.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Remy now makes...

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,360
 Someone asked me this after the first service.

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,880
 They're like, "But does she actually make eye contact with you?"

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
 Yes, she does.

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,520
 She does make eye contact with me, and all is well again in the Armstrong household.

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,800
 But all three of us, my son, my wife, and I are adjusting to now being a family of four.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,440
 Having a little girl has been fun.

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,720
 My son, he's three years old, and he is learning, man.

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,160
 He's never had a sibling before.

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
 He's the oldest, so he's learning.

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,960
 He's trying to figure out, "How do I engage?"

65
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,400
 He doesn't know, "How do I play with a tiny little baby?"

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
 He goes to school.

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,520
 He has all the energy in the world, and she's just like, "Man."

68
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,400
 So it's a bit of a journey for him.

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,160
 And I realize that he's been watching me.

70
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,880
 He's been watching me when I didn't realize he was watching me.

71
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,640
 He's been learning from me.

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,720
 He's been spying on me.

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,280
 A few weeks ago, I walked into our living room, and Remy's in her space, and I see,

74
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,960
 but I hear Elias over her little Moses basket.

75
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,400
 He's like, "How you doing, my little girl, girl?"

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
 In a high-pitched voice, and he's got his nose next to her nose, and he's tickling her

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
 feet, and he's doing all my mannerisms.

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,640
 And I'm like, "Yo, dude is stealing."

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,320
 First of all, "Girl, girl," that's what I say, okay?

80
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,320
 Kayla, my wife, is girl because she's number one, the number one woman in my life, so she's

81
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
 my girl.

82
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,240
 Remy is my second most important woman in my life, girl, girl, so she's my girl, girl.

83
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,360
 Elias doesn't know this.

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,600
 He's three years old, but he's referring to her as his girl, girl, and I'm just getting

85
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,960
 a little bit jealous and annoyed as a father.

86
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,200
 Like, pray for me.

87
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's a whole thing.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,480
 But I'm realizing he's catching on to the things that we are doing, and I'm not trying

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 to be an example.

90
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,280
 He just happens to learn from me, and he's listening, and this is slightly problematic

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,760
 because he's in school now.

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,760
 And so every so often, he takes the things that he hears from home to school, so I'm

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,160
 already a pretty holy man, but just know I am being even more holy.

94
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,920
 When I stub my toe, I quote scripture just to make sure that Elias doesn't say anything

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,200
 inappropriate, and we get emails at small world.

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,760
 But I am now properly recognizing the impact and the example that I am to my son.

97
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,200
 You know, my wife and I are both pretty big examples for him.

98
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,360
 He copies what we do.

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
 He listens when we know he's listening.

100
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,680
 He listens when we don't know he's listening, and he's repeating after us, and we're pretty

101
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,640
 much the biggest example in his life.

102
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,760
 Now he, one day, will be the biggest example in Remy's life because he's the oldest, right?

103
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,400
 Are there any firstborns here?

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,760
 Anyone who's a firstborn and have siblings?

105
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,880
 No, no, only children.

106
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,000
 Just firstborn with siblings, right?

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,480
 So I'm the firstborn of three, right?

108
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,320
 My brother Jeremy is great but not as cool.

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,760
 My sister Jasmine's great but nowhere as cool.

110
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,120
 I'm the oldest, and I remember growing up, my mom, I can still hear it to this day.

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,840
 My mom would be like, "Now be careful what you do because, you know, Jeremy is watching

112
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
 you.

113
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,360
 He's looking up to you as an example."

114
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,040
 And actually, I didn't share this in the first story, but let me just tell you guys what

115
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,920
 kind of example I've been to my brother.

116
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,800
 So I played baseball.

117
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,160
 I'm five years older, just so you know.

118
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
 There's plenty of space.

119
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,200
 I played baseball.

120
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,640
 My brother played baseball after me.

121
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,640
 I started playing guitar self-taught.

122
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,520
 Jeremy started playing guitar self-taught.

123
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
 I ended up marrying a white woman.

124
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,560
 My brother ends up marrying a white...

125
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,720
 Like he literally has copied every single thing.

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,200
 I have been such an example, you guys.

127
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
 It's been a good time.

128
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,600
 Jeremy, I love you if you ever watch this, for the record.

129
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,040
 But yeah, so the way that he operates, my son will have to be an example at some point

130
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,840
 to his sister, Remy.

131
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,720
 And examples are super helpful.

132
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,960
 Having a guide, having someone who has gone ahead of you, who can give you a bit of a

133
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,880
 template, who you can look at when things are challenging is helpful because times do

134
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
 get challenging for us.

135
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,800
 Things are tricky, and sometimes we don't know the answer.

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,720
 And rather than trying to blaze the trail yourself and figure it out, we have templates

137
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
 in life.

138
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
 We have examples.

139
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,440
 And as we sit in this second week of our forgiveness series, I want to pretty much premise everything

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:28,520
 on the idea that Jesus was perhaps the greatest example of what forgiveness looks like.

141
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,480
 If we want to know what forgiveness looks like, perhaps the first step is to be like

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:40,520
 my son and to watch, to analyze, to examine the things that Jesus did to truly be able

143
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,320
 to understand what forgiveness really is.

144
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,520
 It's not something that we've created in the 21st century.

145
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,120
 We don't have to set up how to forgive.

146
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,920
 Actually, we have a pretty good template of the most powerful example of forgiveness found

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
 in Christ.

148
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,720
 Extreme and radical forgiveness is meant to serve as a template to the church on how we

149
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,280
 ought to forgive one another because forgiveness is a hard thing.

150
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,560
 Forgiveness is not an easy thing.

151
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,160
 I think sometimes we get the misconception that we should just like do it.

152
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,840
 It's a pretty challenging thing, especially if we're going to forgive the way Jesus forgave.

153
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,800
 No, we've got to be able to see him, hear him, examine his example to be able to draw

154
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,840
 strength and guidance on how to forgive.

155
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,320
 Perhaps there's no better place to really set up the forgiveness of Jesus than with

156
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,440
 the idea of the gospel.

157
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:49,360
 The gospel is this, that Christ offers forgiveness to all, to all people for all things.

158
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,400
 He offers, he's put on the table the chance for forgiveness.

159
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,640
 All who have sinned and have fallen short, who's not been enough, who've messed up, this

160
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,600
 forgiveness ends up being the fabric of our salvation.

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,040
 It ends up paving the pathway for our reconciliation.

162
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,960
 It ends up being the foundation of our redemption.

163
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,200
 This is powerful forgiveness.

164
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,560
 Based off of what I've heard from this community, we need powerful forgiveness when it still

165
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,320
 hurts and you still carry the hurt of the offense that was done to you.

166
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,480
 You need powerful forgiveness when you still have to look the other person in the eye who's

167
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,160
 wronged you painfully or still live in that space.

168
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,680
 You need powerful forgiveness when the words spoken over you still mark and direct you

169
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,680
 to today.

170
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,520
 You need a powerful forgiveness, not some simple stuff.

171
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,400
 You need the powerful stuff.

172
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,840
 And luckily enough, we have the example of Jesus and the kind of forgiveness he gives

173
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,960
 us as a template of something to look at.

174
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,920
 When your offense cuts deep, you have the powerful forgiveness of Jesus as your template.

175
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,480
 So I think it's best that we examine the gospel and the tenets of it because it will provide

176
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,640
 us both a blueprint and a guide to give us strength in the kind of forgiveness that we're

177
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,200
 looking into.

178
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,460
 So the scriptures are quite clear on what the gospel is, but I think for most Christians,

179
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,880
 we don't use the word gospel every day.

180
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,440
 It's just not a conversation piece.

181
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,000
 You don't use the word gospel when you're talking to your friends.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,600
 So probably for that reason, we don't properly understand all of what it means.

183
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
 Just a way for us to understand the word gospel.

184
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,160
 I'm not going to go into all the Greek around it, but the simple Greek translation of the

185
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,520
 word gospel is the phrase good news.

186
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,160
 So rather than thinking of the gospel of Jesus and it just being kind of like church jargon,

187
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,560
 think the good news of Jesus.

188
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,240
 Something good has happened and we are in response to that good news.

189
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,800
 When we say the gospel of Jesus sets you free, it's the good news that he offers that sets

190
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
 you free.

191
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
 Gospel is good news.

192
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,040
 For the Christian, it's the gospel proclamation and the inauguration of the reality of the

193
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
 good news of Jesus.

194
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,600
 And that good news is pretty clear.

195
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,360
 It's that this because of Jesus, if we now will confess our sins, he is faithful and

196
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,760
 he is just to forgive us of all our sins and he will cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.

197
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,840
 So gospel, the good news is that we can be forgiven, that we can stand forgiven and are

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
 new.

199
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,280
 And I know a lot of this probably isn't going to be new information for you.

200
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,240
 I'm not trying to teach you anything new today.

201
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,640
 I'm hoping that as we examine the gospel, as we remember what it is that Christ has

202
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,520
 done for us and what it means to live in that gospel, that God will just shed light on it

203
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,520
 for us to properly understand what these terms are and what it means for us.

204
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,440
 So we're going to examine it closely today.

205
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,600
 We've been forgiven.

206
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,300
 Our sins are not just canceled, but our debt is paid.

207
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,040
 The scales have been balanced.

208
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
 God remains a God of love and of justice simultaneously.

209
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,120
 And we have to understand the elements and the tenets of what this gospel means.

210
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,480
 So in one column, you've got sin.

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,760
 In the other column, we're going to talk about what exactly Jesus did for us, how he actually

212
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 forgives us.

213
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,480
 And then lastly, we're going to look at what does all that mean?

214
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,800
 What does that actually offer us?

215
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,480
 What are the benefits of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and what he forgives

216
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,640
 us from?

217
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,320
 So when we look at sin and we understand sin, sin ends up being one of the first major players

218
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,640
 in this concept of our existence.

219
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,480
 And I think for lots of us, we don't fully understand what sin is.

220
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,920
 Like we understand some of the fruit of sin.

221
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,040
 We understand like the things you're not supposed to do, but like what is sin at its core?

222
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,920
 And I think we have to understand it if we're going to have any chance of doing what Paul

223
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
 tells us.

224
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,380
 He says that you should flee from sin.

225
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,600
 Not like inch away, not like go to like where's the line of what can I do and what I can't

226
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,520
 do, build my house here and say, "Oh, look, I'm still good."

227
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,080
 No, if you understand sin the way Paul understands sin, then you flee from it at all costs.

228
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,760
 You run away from it.

229
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,000
 You avoid it.

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,960
 You want to remove it from your life.

231
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,200
 So we're going to start with understanding what sin is.

232
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,760
 Sin tempts us.

233
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
 It entices us.

234
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,040
 Then it traps you and it entangles you.

235
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,200
 It's meant to separate you from God, introducing elements like shame and guilt.

236
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,520
 And we've all fallen susceptible to this.

237
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,480
 Scripture would say that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

238
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,320
 We are all guilty of this.

239
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,680
 And when we break down what sin means, in our sin we end up doing this concept where

240
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,240
 instead of having God as the one in charge of our lives, instead of having God as the

241
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,320
 one who rules and reigns over all things, we have exchanged that and put ourselves on

242
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 top of it.

243
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,040
 Any sin you can think of, it has been an exchange of God for you.

244
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,540
 We've replaced God.

245
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,360
 In the Garden of Eden, we've chosen for ourselves our definition of what good and what evil

246
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,480
 is versus God's definition.

247
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,640
 And we still see that to this day.

248
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,960
 We don't know what truth is anymore.

249
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
 Everything is subjective.

250
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,480
 Everything is your own truth.

251
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,520
 Live what you think.

252
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,680
 Live your own peace.

253
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,600
 We've exchanged what God says is good and evil for our definition.

254
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,840
 Secondly, we've exchanged the way for human flourishing.

255
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
 God has a way.

256
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,440
 He has set up a design so that all would flourish.

257
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,160
 In sin, we have exchanged that method for our own methods, a me first method, a me and

258
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,040
 my clan doing whatever I can to help myself get ahead.

259
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,320
 We end up exchanging his method.

260
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,640
 It ends up hurting people.

261
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,280
 It ends up hurting his creation.

262
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,120
 It robs us, or at least it challenges our understanding of our morality.

263
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,080
 It pushes us.

264
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,960
 We exchange God's definitions.

265
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,240
 We exchange his way.

266
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,880
 So boiling down, sin is this.

267
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,560
 It's replacing God with ourselves.

268
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
 It's an easy way to think of sin.

269
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,480
 Sin is replacing God with ourselves where we've decided that we know better, that our

270
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,060
 lives are too precious to leave into someone's hands, so we take charge.

271
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,980
 We do it our way because, you know, this is me we're talking about.

272
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,340
 This is me and my family and the things that I need.

273
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,680
 We do whatever we can to make sure we get what we need.

274
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,280
 The basic nature of that is what sin is.

275
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,040
 We filled ourselves with the things that are opposed with God.

276
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,600
 We've labeled somehow these subjective things as the ultimate good, and we find ourselves

277
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,000
 as a people striving after achievement and after earnings, and we've labeled that as

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,140
 like this is the indicator.

279
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,560
 This is the metric of what a good life looks like.

280
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,240
 If you can earn this much, if you can achieve this much, if you can live in this house,

281
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,960
 if you can have this car, if you can marry this person, you've achieved, but that is

282
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,160
 not God's definition of what a good life looks like.

283
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,240
 In our sin, we've exchanged.

284
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,480
 We've twisted and poisoned the good that is here, trying to preserve ourselves, trying

285
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,040
 to get ahead, and the thing that we're aiming for, the thing that we're trying to attain

286
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,200
 ends up trapping us, ends up ensnaring us, ends up entangling us, and we find ourselves

287
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,920
 not actually achieving those things or earning those things.

288
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,680
 We find ourselves ultimately becoming slaves to those things where we work and live and

289
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,880
 breathe just to get ahead, just to make a certain milestone in a financial setting,

290
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,560
 just to earn a certain amount, just to live in a certain place, just to be a certain like

291
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
 that.

292
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,840
 That is not the reason we are here.

293
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,440
 Genesis would tell us that when God created us, he had a mandate for humanity.

294
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,520
 He had a purpose in why we would exist.

295
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,720
 Yes, we bring him glory, but he actually had a mission for us.

296
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,500
 He created us, and he wanted us to have dominion over all creation.

297
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,120
 He had a purpose for us to reflect his image, to live as his image bearers, his representatives

298
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,880
 on earth, and when we fall into sin, when we take our lives into our own hand, when

299
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,240
 we define what is good and what's evil for ourselves, we end up becoming a slave to ourselves,

300
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
 to our desires.

301
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,240
 We end up being controlled by creation, and what a tragedy.

302
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,840
 What an absolute tragedy.

303
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,640
 We end up morally and spiritually spiraling while living in the consequences of poor decisions,

304
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,200
 dethroning God and replacing him with a lesser God who is subject to temptation and gives

305
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,160
 in.

306
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,800
 Scripture would tell us that this is sin, and sin has a price.

307
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,040
 Sin has a consequence.

308
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,800
 There is a response.

309
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,760
 The wages of sin is death, right?

310
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:55,020
 So when we sin, the consequence of that is death, and our world experiences this now.

311
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,720
 How much sin in the world causes death?

312
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,960
 Causes the decay of humanity.

313
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,760
 Causes the decay of our love for our neighbor, even our love for ourselves, and it's not

314
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,920
 just a physical death that we are spiraling into.

315
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,960
 There's also the eternal state that God has created us to be in starts to corrode, and

316
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:24,080
 we find ourselves in this cosmic battle between God and his goodness, and our sin and death.

317
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,120
 This is sin.

318
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,320
 This is sin, and its impact is so strong.

319
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:38,080
 But God, in his goodness and in his love, steps in.

320
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,720
 He interjects.

321
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,720
 He intercepts us as we are headed for disaster.

322
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,600
 I normally speak pretty exaggerated and poetically in just all the things because I'm a musician,

323
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 right?

324
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,840
 I want to clarify that what I'm about to say next is not something I came up with.

325
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,160
 This is how scripture defined God intercepting our sin, okay?

326
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,520
 Scripture uses very poetic, very intense and weighty words so that we can get a picture,

327
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,200
 a clear picture and understand exactly what he does.

328
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,560
 It says that yet while we were still sinner and while we were still away from him, while

329
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,040
 we were still dead in our sin, God sent Christ for us.

330
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,880
 So before we did anything right, before you thought, "Oh, maybe I could be a better person,"

331
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,200
 before you reconciled yourself and decided to overcome whatever the temptation is in

332
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,980
 your life, before you said, "Sorry," God has sent Jesus.

333
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,000
 This is where the gospel, the good news of Jesus shines into our world that despite all

334
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,160
 being lost and all being broken, Christ has come.

335
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:54,360
 And he's not just come to erase our sins, he's come to forgive you and to make you new.

336
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,680
 This is what he's aiming for.

337
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,780
 This is what his forgiveness is meant to look like.

338
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,980
 If we confess our sins, he is faithful like we sung a minute ago.

339
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:09,920
 He is faithful and he is just to forgive us of those sins and cleanse us of all unrighteousness.

340
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,120
 There is no death.

341
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,600
 There is no death that's too low.

342
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,720
 There is nothing you can do that is so bad that Christ's blood cannot cover.

343
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,080
 This is what his forgiveness looks like.

344
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,700
 You remember when I said that Christ offers us a powerful forgiveness?

345
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,920
 This is what I'm talking about.

346
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,440
 That is a powerful forgiveness.

347
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,960
 Don't we wish we knew how to live in a way where we could forgive others like that?

348
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,400
 The scripture would tell us that God loves us, right?

349
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
 I think we know that.

350
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,360
 God loves us.

351
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,160
 His forgiveness is not a siloed act.

352
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,520
 It's not just him responding to the fact that we made mistakes.

353
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,480
 No, but it tells us that God's forgiveness is an intentional act of love.

354
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,120
 John 3, 16, perhaps the most famous passage in scripture says what?

355
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:02,400
 For God so loved the world that he sent his son.

356
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,160
 And through his son, we get the forgiveness of our sins.

357
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,700
 In order to forgive us, God gives us Jesus.

358
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,320
 This is what his love looks like.

359
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,600
 He could have outsourced it.

360
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,880
 In the scripture, you read about like Michael the archangel or Gabriel who visits.

361
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,240
 He could have sent one of those guys.

362
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,520
 No, he sends Jesus.

363
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,160
 And just to clarify, Jesus, God, same, okay?

364
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
 Same thing.

365
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,200
 Jesus is God in flesh.

366
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,000
 So scripture in Isaiah 7, we call him Emmanuel, God with us, God incarnate.

367
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,760
 So God doesn't just send some dude named Jesus.

368
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,920
 God puts on flesh and blood and he comes still being divine, still being God, and he walks

369
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,480
 among broken people.

370
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,160
 He comes and he lives with us and he understands us.

371
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,080
 He walks our journey.

372
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,160
 God sends Jesus.

373
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,200
 He ultimately sends himself.

374
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
 What does that mean?

375
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,120
 It means this, that God made a sacrifice.

376
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,000
 It means that forgiveness isn't just something you do.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
 Forgiveness is a sacrifice you make.

378
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 Right?

379
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 Because in Philippians 2, Paul writes it super beautifully.

380
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,960
 We understand Paul's other epistles.

381
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,440
 We know that he would tell us to imitate him while he imitates Christ.

382
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,600
 The Christian life is, even call yourself a Christian, is Christ-like.

383
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,080
 We're meant to imitate Christ.

384
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,280
 But Paul is going to push this idea significantly further.

385
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,840
 Don't just imitate Christ's actions.

386
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,440
 He's going to pull us and tell us that there's something even bigger, probably a precursor

387
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,800
 to imitating Christ's action that we have to understand.

388
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,680
 He would tell us that we need to imitate the same mindset as Christ.

389
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,580
 We have to think like Christ.

390
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,080
 We have to see things like Christ.

391
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,720
 We have to take on his mindset, how he approached things.

392
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,000
 He took on a mindset of deep humility.

393
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,200
 Deep humility.

394
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,600
 Christ-like forgiveness requires this Christ-like humility.

395
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,200
 So I'm not, I'll just read to you what Philippians 2 says so that you get why I'm saying this.

396
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,800
 Philippians 2, verses 8.

397
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,880
 "Christ, who being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to

398
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,280
 be used to his own advantage.

399
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,680
 Rather instead, he made himself nothing."

400
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
 Big word there.

401
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,160
 He made himself nothing.

402
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,760
 "Taking on the very nature of a servant."

403
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,520
 I use the, I think the ES or the NIV on this.

404
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 I should use the ESV.

405
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,960
 It says, "He made himself a slave."

406
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,120
 Talk about humility, right?

407
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,880
 "Taking on the very nature of a slave, being made in human likeness and being found in

408
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,400
 the appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death, even death

409
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,000
 on a cross."

410
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,520
 This is a wild kind of humility.

411
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,480
 Who lives this way?

412
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,600
 Who steps into such a radical, like this is what God's Christ forgiveness looks like.

413
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,160
 This is how he forgives us.

414
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,560
 He is executed through a radical humility.

415
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:19,760
 So you can't forgive others like Christ forgives without this posture of humility.

416
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,040
 Forgiveness is not something you do to pat yourself on the back.

417
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,240
 It's not something you do to show the world, "Look, I'm a bigger person.

418
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,800
 Am I forgiven?"

419
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,880
 That's not what it's about.

420
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,200
 Consider that forgiveness is rooted in this mindset and this framework and this posture

421
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,800
 of humility.

422
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,480
 And this mark of humility is a bit of a scandal.

423
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:49,840
 It's pretty challenging because I know there's quite a few of us, understandably so, who

424
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:59,840
 would feel that for the offenses done to us, our offenders deserve our anger.

425
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,280
 They deserve our bitterness for what has been said to you, what has shaped your identity.

426
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,600
 They deserve some frustration for how you've been treated, for how you've been hurt.

427
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,080
 The fact that you're still carrying this wound still from a close family loved one, they

428
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,480
 deserve your anger, right?

429
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,640
 They deserve our frustration for the way they've said things and treated you and hurt you.

430
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,040
 We feel that others deserve.

431
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,840
 It's only just that they get what's coming to them.

432
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,000
 This is the natural way of thinking, but let me flip it on its head because Scripture uses

433
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,480
 the word about deserving as well.

434
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,320
 Christ would say that, the Bible would say that we were once children of wrath.

435
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:51,040
 We were enemies of God deserving death.

436
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,360
 We too deserve the thing.

437
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,880
 We deserved death.

438
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:07,200
 But while we were still sinners, before we said sorry, before we repented, forgiveness

439
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,320
 is offered.

440
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,320
 God sends himself to come and take the place of the things that you've done wrong, the

441
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,760
 consequences that you deserve, God sends himself to take that on.

442
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,040
 While we were still sinners, before we get our act together, God substitutes.

443
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
 He exchanges.

444
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,020
 Now remember, when we defined sin, we said that sin was this exchanging of who is God

445
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,960
 in your life from it being God to it being you.

446
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,240
 And in Christ's forgiveness to us, there is another exchange.

447
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,760
 It's an exchange of who is guilty.

448
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,920
 Christ comes in and you are supposed to stand guilty for the things that you've done and

449
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:51,120
 his forgiveness offers an exchange where he stands in the place of our wrongdoings, our

450
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,800
 shortcomings, where we failed, where we've been on purpose and where we've just not been

451
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,820
 strong enough to do the right thing.

452
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:07,000
 He takes our place, which leads us to our salvation, but it's done through the path

453
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,960
 of the cross and the blood of Jesus, which we say if you grew up in church, you've heard

454
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,480
 something about the power of the blood of Jesus, nothing like the blood of Jesus, which

455
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
 kind of doesn't make sense because the idea is that the blood is supposed to wash you

456
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,400
 clean, but if you put blood on something, it doesn't make it clean, it makes it more

457
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
 dirty.

458
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,560
 So I just don't want us to be living in a world where we hear Christian jargon, we sing

459
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
 about it, but we don't understand it.

460
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,880
 So I'm going to take a few minutes to help us understand a little bit more why do we

461
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,240
 say his blood makes us clean?

462
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,920
 How does his blood actually clean us?

463
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
 What does that even mean?

464
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,120
 Are you still tracking with me?

465
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,280
 We're all here?

466
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,720
 So in the Old Testament, for the price of sin, the consequence is death.

467
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:55,440
 God sets up this, I don't know how you want to call it, a system, a sacrificial system

468
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:04,400
 where the place of our sin and the death that we had acquired would be passed on to something

469
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
 else.

470
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,240
 Something had to die in place of our sin.

471
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,120
 So the whole sacrificial system exists.

472
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,200
 You hear about people killing goats and sheep and pigeons or turtle doves or whatever it

473
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
 is.

474
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,920
 They had all these animals that they had to kill, and the animals had to be clean.

475
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,120
 They had to be pure, but you really can't tell the motives of a chicken, can you?

476
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,580
 That might be a little much.

477
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,160
 So God sets up this system where they need to optically be pure.

478
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,200
 That's why they said no animals with blemishes, only the clean ones, the ones that were normally

479
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,080
 young and innocent to some extent.

480
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,960
 And these optical purity, when the animal was killed, that blood, that sacrifice would

481
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,680
 take the place of the death that was upon us for our sins.

482
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,400
 So they had a whole system around this, right?

483
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,360
 And in that system, you had to offer up certain animals for certain sins, but not every animal

484
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,640
 could cover every sin.

485
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,760
 Not every sin could be covered, and at best, what was covered was a temporary cover, because

486
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,240
 after all, it's a sheep for a human, and nowhere is that fair.

487
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,600
 Nowhere is that just or balanced.

488
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,800
 And so God sees this.

489
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
 God knows this.

490
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
 God understands this.

491
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,480
 This is his temporary solution while in the meanwhile, he has his plan, and he sends himself.

492
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,960
 He sends Jesus, and we all know that God dies for us, right?

493
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,040
 Jesus dies for our sins, and we're made clean, but I want to look at the controversy of the

494
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,560
 fact that Jesus actually lived for us to be saved, right?

495
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,400
 So it's not just that he needed to die, but in order for Jesus to be clean, it wasn't

496
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
 about what he looks like.

497
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,840
 It was about the fact that Jesus had to live a life of no sin.

498
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,480
 So that's why you will hear people in the Christian tradition talk about how Jesus lived

499
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,560
 a sinless life.

500
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,600
 If he doesn't live a sinless life, his death doesn't mean anything.

501
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,200
 He had to be pure.

502
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,320
 He had to be clean.

503
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,400
 So Jesus's day in and day out, when Jesus was thirsty and hungry in the desert, being

504
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,160
 tempted by Satan, do you know why he was saying no?

505
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,440
 Yes, because he was God, but because he was remaining clean and pure so that when he would

506
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:16,600
 die and be a sacrifice for us, our sins, all humanity's sins could be covered.

507
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:26,740
 In his forgiveness, Jesus's death covers us and frees us, but it's also in his forgiveness

508
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,380
 that he lives for us.

509
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:35,760
 This blameless life that we get from him gives the blood power.

510
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,560
 It gives, and that's why we sing and we celebrate and when we take communion, we've got the

511
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,280
 little tiny cup with juice in it, right?

512
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,760
 It's because the blood of Jesus has done something for us.

513
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,720
 He lived and he died so that we could properly be forgiven, so that you no longer have to

514
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,280
 be guilty for the sins that you commit.

515
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,920
 That's the whole exchange here.

516
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
 He's stepping in.

517
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,080
 He's taking the place.

518
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,040
 He's exchanging, and I could go on forever around this, but instead I want to give us

519
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 a chance to sit and think.

520
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,920
 Normally here at the Vine, around, I don't know, the 30-minute mark after the service

521
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,600
 or the hour and 30-minute mark, we have a response song and lots of you get up and you

522
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,120
 sprint out for lunch.

523
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
 I get it.

524
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
 It makes sense.

525
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,200
 We're going to, instead of doing that, we're going to sit in this.

526
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,200
 The sermon's not done.

527
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,320
 We'll come back in a minute, but I want us to sit and we're going to put up some words

528
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,680
 and we're going to have a moment.

529
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,360
 This moment is built around the hymn, "How Deep the Father's Love for Us," which portrays,

530
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:43,440
 I think, flawlessly what the exchange looks like.

531
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,600
 For Jesus to hang in our place, for Jesus to take upon himself the wrath of God poured

532
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,240
 out in our place, for Jesus to be the one who stepped in.

533
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,600
 I know you're going to be tempted to sing it because you know the melody, but you'll

534
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,120
 see there's no microphone here.

535
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,320
 There's no singer here.

536
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,640
 We're not singing right now.

537
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,760
 I just want us to sit because I think sometimes when we sing, we sing and we don't think sometimes.

538
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,520
 I think when we sit and we just read, there's a chance that this might hit you differently,

539
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,760
 even if you've been a Christian for 20 years.

540
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:26,160
 There's a chance that you might see and remember and feel just what Jesus did for you.

541
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,040
 So I'm going to hand it over to Jethro.

542
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
 Don't sing.

543
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:36,040
 Take a minute and sit.

 [Music]

576
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:30,040
 The cross is the most powerful expression of Christ's forgiveness for you and for me.

577
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:42,040
 It was a ridiculous display of humility, a commitment to love, and ridiculous obedience.

578
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,040
 It was our sin, it was our debt that he pays with his life and with his blood.

579
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:57,040
 Christ's unforgiveness is actually unfair, because it's unearned,

580
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:11,040
 but it's this beautiful exchange where God himself would take upon him the consequences of the mistakes we've made.

581
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,040
 I mean, I'm preaching this sermon three times, but even as I think about it now,

582
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:24,040
 I don't know, there's just something about really sitting in the reality that God would do that.

583
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,040
 Like, I think we know it, we do know it, but not enough do we sit in it.

584
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:37,040
 And I'm just thankful. I'm just really thankful.

585
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,040
 Beyond what it does for me and all the things that might get after it, I'm just thankful that his love looks like that,

586
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,040
 that his forgiveness is that powerful.

587
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:57,040
 When we consider the weight of our sin, the re-exchange that takes place here,

588
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,040
 the God-sized mistakes that we've made, the God complex which we live within,

589
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,040
 when we consider just how deep our sin was and is, it gives us a great opportunity to see how much greater

590
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:20,040
 the forgiveness of God is to cancel the debt, to satisfy our debt.

591
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:27,040
 Then we understand what Christ did for us. Then we understand that his forgiveness isn't something that you earn.

592
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,040
 You don't behave good enough and now you get forgiven.

593
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,040
 You don't come to church enough and now you're forgiven.

594
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,040
 You don't not say bad words and now you're forgiven.

595
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:45,040
 No, it's not something you can earn. It's something he has given to you of his own accord.

596
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:53,040
 It's a grace. And it's because of that that we can boast in no thing, no power, no wisdom, no gift, no nothing.

597
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,040
 Nothing we've done, but it's a free gift given to all of us.

598
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,040
 It's a ridiculous thing God has done. That if we confess our sins, he would be faithful

599
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,040
 and he would be just to forgive us those sins, cleanse us of all unrighteousness.

600
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,040
 The gospel is a proclamation of good news.

601
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:19,040
 This is good news that Jesus is willing to forgive all people of all things.

602
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,040
 And when we see that our sins are now forgiven, when we see the way in which he forgives us,

603
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:30,040
 the type of humility that he has to have, the kind of sacrifice he's willing to make,

604
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,040
 we have to ask ourselves, what does it produce?

605
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,040
 We are forgiven. What does that actually mean?

606
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,040
 We understand sin, we understand his sacrifice, but what does it mean that we are forgiven?

607
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,040
 His forgiveness makes available to us a reconciled relationship

608
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:54,040
 and it reawakens our spirits and it reaffirms our identity into God's family.

609
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,040
 In short, Christ's forgiveness is our salvation.

610
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,040
 When you hear people say, "Are you saved?" or "I was saved on this date,"

611
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,040
 this is what we mean by saved. His forgiveness leads us to that salvation.

612
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,040
 It is our salvation. In our sin, we lived as hostile towards God.

613
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,040
 We lived as enemies towards God, but what Jesus's forgiveness does is that it brings you in.

614
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,040
 He doesn't forgive you and say, "Now, never come back again. I've forgiven you. Now just leave."

615
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,040
 No, he forgives and he draws you into himself.

616
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,040
 He makes a channel, a pathway available that you can commune and know the heart of God

617
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 to where the most sovereign being, the creator of everything, will speak to you,

618
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,040
 will inspire you, will talk to you, will comfort you.

619
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,040
 This is what his forgiveness does for us.

620
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,040
 It's another exchange where...and before Christ's forgiveness,

621
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
 if God would look upon us, he would see our sin.

622
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,040
 He would see where we've fallen short because of Christ's forgiveness.

623
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,040
 And if we will accept that salvation, when God looks at you and exchange takes place,

624
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:13,040
 there is an imparted...Christ puts his righteousness, his perfect, flawless living,

625
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,040
 his sinless, pure life, he puts all that he has actually done upon you

626
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:25,040
 so that when God looks at you, God's not angry. You know that?

627
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,040
 As Christians, the mistakes you've made, when God looks at you, he's not annoyed.

628
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,040
 He's not like, "Oh, you did it again." But I think a lot of us feel that way.

629
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,040
 It probably makes us hesitate to come close to God

630
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,040
 because we think he sees us for what we've done, but the freedom that is found

631
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,040
 in Christ's forgiveness is that he sees you based off of what Jesus has done.

632
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,040
 That's powerful forgiveness.

633
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,040
 His righteousness, Christ's righteousness has been imputed towards us.

634
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 Another gift that we get is this reawakening of our spirits.

635
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,040
 Right? So God could have forgiven us and left us be.

636
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,040
 Okay, he draws us in and he now looks at us the way that Christ behaved.

637
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:15,040
 But then he gives us a spirit. He gives us his spirit that acts as our counselor,

638
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,040
 as our comforter, as our companion.

639
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,040
 It's the one that helps us understand scripture and the word of God.

640
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,040
 He gives us this beautiful gift of himself.

641
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,040
 Like how many times do you forgive someone and say, "Also, I have a gift for you."

642
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
 This is not very common, right?

643
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
 This is how Christ's forgiveness looks like.

644
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,040
 He draws you in and then he gives you stuff.

645
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,040
 He gives you himself, his spirit.

646
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,040
 Not just the breath that we see in Genesis where he breathed his spirit and we're alive.

647
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,040
 Now he sends his spirit to forever dwell in us.

648
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,040
 And it says that with this spirit of God in us,

649
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 we would be able to do even more than Christ has done.

650
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,040
 Oh, he lived perfect.

651
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,040
 That's just wild, right? Like what a gift.

652
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
 This is what he gives us in his forgiveness.

653
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,040
 Our spirits are reawakened and we end up becoming people who live by the spirit.

654
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,040
 Most of Paul's books would have some section in his epistles

655
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,040
 about living by the spirit, being new in the spirit.

656
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,040
 And it's because of this idea that Jesus' forgiveness doesn't--

657
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,040
 I think a lot of us think it wipes the slate clean, right?

658
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,040
 It wipes the sins that we had here. It just wipes it.

659
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
 I wish I had a whiteboard. I could show you it.

660
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,040
 He doesn't wipe it. He like throws the board away and he gives you a new one.

661
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,040
 It's not about like cleaning it off.

662
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,040
 It's Jesus gives you a new--this is why it says that in Galatians,

663
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,040
 "The old is gone, the new has come in Christ Jesus."

664
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 He's not trying to clean off how bad your sins are.

665
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,040
 He's giving you something new. He's giving you a new life, a new spirit,

666
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
 a newness that we can now live in the spirit.

667
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
 We can now walk in the spirit.

668
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,040
 We can set our hearts and our eyes on things of the spirit.

669
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,040
 He's giving us a new slate. We are made new.

670
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,040
 And the last thing he does, which I just think is absolutely wild, genuinely crazy,

671
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,040
 is this idea that he brings us into his family.

672
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,040
 I just can't imagine a scenario where you forgive someone of a tremendous debt

673
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,040
 and then after you forgive them, you say, "Also, here's my will.

674
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,040
 I'm writing your name on it."

675
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,040
 Like think about this stuff.

676
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,040
 Like this is the gospel that Jesus not only forgives you of his sin,

677
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,040
 but he brings you into his family.

678
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,040
 He says, "You used to be sons and daughters of wrath and you deserve death,

679
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
 but now you are children of God."

680
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,040
 First John, where we get our anchor verse we've been reading like three times today,

681
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,040
 in the few verses or the few chapters that are there,

682
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,040
 John refers to us as children 13 times.

683
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
 Like it's really clear that God wants you in the family.

684
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,040
 He doesn't want you thinking, "I have to earn this. My son doesn't earn my love.

685
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 Remy will never have to earn my love because they're my children.

686
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,040
 And if I can love my kids this way, how much more will God love you?"

687
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
 He brings you in.

688
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,040
 Modern day forgiveness is you say you're sorry, maybe I'm a little angry, but whatever.

689
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
 I don't have to see you again. We forgive and we forget.

690
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
 That's not God's playbook.

691
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,040
 This is not how we've been forgiven.

692
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,040
 The forgiveness offered to you is he forgives you and he brings you in

693
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,040
 and he floods you with gifts, with his spirit, with an awakening in your spirits

694
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
 where you can sense the things of the spirit.

695
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,040
 He puts you on the list. You are now a child of God.

696
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,040
 You inherit the goodness and all that God has.

697
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,040
 The power of God resides in you.

698
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,040
 Like this is why we have to, the crux of the sermon,

699
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,040
 this is why we have to look at Christ's example of forgiveness

700
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,040
 because this is the only place that we see forgiveness that looks like this.

701
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,040
 No other religion, no other culture, no other story

702
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,040
 has a forgiveness that looks like this.

703
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,040
 This is like not even heard of anywhere.

704
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,040
 It's absolutely one of one.

705
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
 This is how Christ forgives.

706
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,040
 He brings you into the family.

707
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
 He doesn't treat you like family.

708
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
 Paul would say he grafts you in.

709
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,040
 You become his children.

710
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,040
 And this is why he would say you must be born again, born into the family of God.

711
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
 This is, it's so important that we get it.

712
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,040
 The family of God, you are in God's family.

713
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
 Stop trying to earn it.

714
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,040
 Don't think you can lose it.

715
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,040
 If you accept his forgiveness, if you will walk that path to salvation,

716
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,040
 if you will journey with him, he puts you in the family.

717
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,040
 You don't have to beat yourself up all the time.

718
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,040
 You don't have to worry about your status.

719
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,040
 No, he loves you. He loves you.

720
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,040
 He loves us.

721
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,040
 I feel like this sermon, and I feel like you probably think the same thing as well,

722
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,040
 could have been boiled down to like a three-minute idea

723
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,040
 because it's just been the same thing over and over again about the gospel.

724
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,040
 But ultimately, what it's saying is that despite what you've done,

725
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
 despite what you're prone to do,

726
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,040
 despite how big the mistakes you made

727
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,040
 or how terrible the choices you chose to make,

728
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,040
 despite how short you've come up,

729
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,040
 despite the frustrations that you might have caused,

730
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,040
 God is armed, and I use that word on purpose,

731
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,040
 he is armed with forgiveness,

732
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,040
 ready, quick to forgive, slow to anger.

733
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
 This is our God.

734
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
 This is the gospel.

735
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,040
 This is why we call it good news, right?

736
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
 This is good news.

737
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,040
 Not a clean slate, a new slate, fully new.

738
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,040
 And I tell you this gospel story because it is of the utmost importance,

739
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,040
 and we have to remember, we have to remember.

740
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,040
 In our world, we're flooded with so much stuff, we forget.

741
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,040
 We have to sit and remember what he's actually done for us,

742
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,040
 what it actually looks like, the fact that it cost him things.

743
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,040
 And forgiveness won't just be something that we muster up with our strength

744
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
 and we remember this.

745
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,040
 If we can remember correctly, if we can remember what we've been forgiven from,

746
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,040
 perhaps it's going to impact the way that we forgive.

747
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,040
 And I want to, before it comes out weird and you think I'm saying something else,

748
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,040
 I want to clarify, I'm not saying that, you know,

749
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
 if you just trust in Jesus, all of a sudden,

750
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,040
 the way you are hurt won't hurt no more.

751
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,040
 I'm not just saying that if you just trust in Jesus,

752
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
 forgiveness becomes easy overnight.

753
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,040
 That's actually nowhere in the 66 books of Scripture.

754
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,040
 No, forgiveness is hard, and because it's hard,

755
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,040
 we need a strength that we don't find in ourselves.

756
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,040
 I have, if you were here for Converse, I just chose a few.

757
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,040
 We had a prayer station where you got a chance to write the things

758
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
 that you were dealing with when it came to forgiveness,

759
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,040
 some of the offenses, some of the hurt that you're living with.

760
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,040
 Forgiveness isn't easy because we've had hurt in our lives.

761
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:19,040
 Someone wrote, "I forgive blank for betraying my trust and my love for you."

762
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
 That causes deep hurt.

763
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,040
 You can't just will your way or Jesus coat that, right?

764
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,040
 Someone wrote, "Forgiving myself, even though I know I'm sinful,

765
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,040
 God has already forgiven me, and I need to quit the shame

766
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,040
 because I'm a new person."

767
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
 Someone else just wrote, "Forgiveness towards God."

768
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,040
 Someone wrote, "Forgiving themselves."

769
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
 Two people wrote, "Forgiving themselves."

770
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,040
 Someone said, "Forgiving my ma and my pa."

771
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,040
 "I release forgiveness.

772
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,040
 The things you did hurt, but I know you did your best."

773
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,040
 Forgiveness, when it's that close, is hard.

774
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,040
 "Lord, help me let go of the way my in-laws treat me."

775
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,040
 I know most people make a joke about that, but that will impact your life, right?

776
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,040
 "My dad, my grandmother, my country, my old friends, my family."

777
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,040
 Guys, forgiveness isn't something that a sermon fixes.

778
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,040
 It's something that Jesus helps us with.

779
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:22,040
 So, forgiveness is still going to be super hard after this.

780
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,040
 So, I do want it to be debunked.

781
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:34,040
 I want it to be clear that you don't have to have the strength to forgive on your own.

782
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,040
 That forgiveness isn't something that you just do,

783
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,040
 but that forgiveness is actually something that requires supernatural strength.

784
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:48,040
 When we still carry the pains of our hurt, we need God's help to forgive.

785
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:53,040
 When we still live with the scars of what's been done to us, we need God's help to forgive.

786
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,040
 In order for us to come close to this "forgive your brother 70 times 7" concept,

787
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,040
 we need God's help.

788
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
 And that's what the gospel shows us.

789
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,040
 So, look, I have two points, super simple.

790
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,040
 The goal of this sermon is to help you remember.

791
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:16,040
 It's to create space for us to remember the gospel, what Jesus has done,

792
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,040
 and to see it real, real clear.

793
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,040
 And so, the two things I want you to take with you,

794
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:26,040
 I want us to remember so that we know what forgiveness truly looks like, okay?

795
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,040
 Remember so that you know exactly what you were forgiven from,

796
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,040
 exactly who forgave you, and what that sacrifice cost them.

797
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,040
 Remember so that you can know what forgiveness looks like.

798
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:48,040
 The second thing is remember so that we know where to go for our strength,

799
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:57,040
 so that we don't go to other places thinking that this person or this thing is going to help me forgive.

800
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,040
 There's no other forgiveness story out there like this.

801
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,040
 Only in Jesus can you find this kind of forgiveness for yourself

802
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:13,040
 and find the strength to lean on him and that spirit in him that is now in you

803
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,040
 to forgive others of the things that they've done.

804
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,040
 Forgiveness is important.

805
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,040
 It's very important to all of our hearts.

806
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,040
 And so, today, I want to create space for us not just to stand up and sing,

807
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
 so I'm going to again ask you not to stand up.

808
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,040
 You can sing if you want, but we're going to create space to sit for a minute

809
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,040
 and just think and just reflect because there's some of us here who,

810
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,040
 if we think about it, if we ask ourselves and we're honest,

811
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:48,040
 today is a chance for us to realize it's not about how hard we try to earn God's forgiveness.

812
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,040
 It requires God's help to forgive others.

813
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:58,040
 There are some of us today who this is just a chance to slow down and stop striving.

814
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,040
 There are some of us today who don't know Jesus,

815
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:08,040
 and this is a chance to come in closer and ask him to reveal himself to you,

816
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,040
 that this gospel, this good news, because it's not for all people.

817
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,040
 It's for those who will confess their sins.

818
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,040
 There's a condition to believe in him, not believe in yourself.

819
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:26,040
 So maybe you're here today and this is your first time hearing the gospel.

820
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:31,040
 Maybe you're here today and you just need help.

821
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,040
 He is our ever-present help.

822
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,040
 That's such a good phrase, like always present, always available,

823
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,040
 never taking a nap, never on vacation.

824
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,040
 He's always present, ever-present help.

825
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,040
 Maybe today's a chance for you to lean upon that ever-present help.

826
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,040
 I don't know what kind of work he needs to do, but I'm going to get off stage.

827
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,040
 The band's going to sing that song.

828
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,040
 Don't get up. Don't rush out, guys.

829
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,040
 We're not just going to wait.

830
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,040
 Sit in this.

831
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,040
 Ask God, what is he saying?

832
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,040
 What is he revealing?

833
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,040
 What is he unearthing?

834
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,040
 What is he building in you?

835
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,040
 Let him do a little bit of work in you today.

836
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
 That's why we're here.

837
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,620
 (gentle music)
