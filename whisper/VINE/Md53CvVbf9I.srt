1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Amen. Amen. Hey, can we thank our worship team as always just for all that they are. Why don't you have a seat?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And my name is Andrew, one of the pastors here, and we're so glad you're here with us. If you're here online, welcome guys.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 If you're here particularly online for the first time, maybe you're checking this out either live right now in this moment,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 or you're watching sometime in the week ahead, we're so glad you're with us as well.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I am healthy and back. That's nice to know. Thank you so much for, yeah, thank you for your prayers last week.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I had a lip infection. You might notice that there's a little scab on my lip right now. Don't worry, I'm not contagious anymore.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 But I had a really bad lip infection. My lip swelled up like a sausage. It was the most ugliest thing in the world.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And yet I'm back now. My lip is not as swollen. And I'm excited to be with you and to open up a really important topic to us, I think.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I wonder, have you ever had a moment in your life, right, where you're having a conversation with someone,

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 and that conversation takes a turn, and maybe the person you're talking to says something,

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 and it completely changes, shifts your perspective about something.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Have you ever had one of those conversations where somebody says something, and the conversation goes somewhere,

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 and suddenly you have a new way of thinking, a new way of understanding something,

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 and it shifts the perspective, and it brings in a revolutionary way of thinking about something.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Anybody ever had one of those conversations? Yeah? Just me?

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I had one of those conversations just a couple of months ago.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I was talking with a really good friend of mine. Her name's Madeline Miller.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Madeline and her husband, Nick, were a part of the Vine for many years, part of the old-school Vine crowd that were with us back towards the time at the beginning.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And Madeline now currently lives in London with her family, and she's studying right now to become an Anglican priest.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And Madeline and I, we were talking on Zoom recently, and we were talking about a shared topic of passion that we have, which is suffering and faith.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I know it doesn't sound very exciting, right? But we're passionate about this suffering and faith.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And as we were talking about this topic, Madeline says something that completely arrests me.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 She says this. She says, "Have you ever wondered why, when somebody that we know who is grieving,

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 and perhaps somebody in their family has passed away or died or something, and we're at the funeral of that person,

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 and our friend is really grieving for the person that they've lost, have you ever wondered why is it that we show up and we bring flowers to the funeral?"

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And I thought to myself, I know that that's the practice. Like, I know that's what we do.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Like, if you've ever been to a funeral, I'm a pastor, I've been to quite a few funerals.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I'm sure you guys have been to funerals and memorials. When you do it here in Hong Kong,

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 often you go into a funeral home and there's flowers, there's lilies like this all over the room.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Have you ever stopped to wonder, why is it that we have an inclination to bring something like a flower into the moment of somebody's great suffering?

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And I had to admit to Madeline that I'd never really thought that one through.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 I knew the practice, but I didn't really understand the purpose.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And she said, "Well, I think it's got something to do with the reality that God has designed beauty to come alongside and be a partner with suffering."

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 That conversation with Madeline and the subsequent discussion that we had resulted in this two-week series that I'm starting with us here today.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Because I think Madeline is right.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 That I think God has designed there to be something significant about beauty and suffering.

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I mean, have you ever wondered why?

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 In moments of great struggle and trial, in moments of great pain and suffering for our friends,

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 we have this innate desire in us, don't we, to do something beautiful for them.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Like to buy a car that has beautiful writing in it, that we write something beautiful to encourage inside.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Or that we want to buy those flowers and we want to go into their hospital room and put that vase of flowers right there by the side of their bed.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Or maybe we want to buy a piece of art and hang it up in a room somewhere.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Or we want to buy some jewelry or something.

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 We have this desire to bring beauty into moments of abject pain and hurt and suffering.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And if that is true, that beauty has been designed by God to somehow come alongside and transform and renew the realities of our suffering.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Could it be then, that in this hour here in Hong Kong, in this history moment that we're in in our city,

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 a city that is still suffering much, a city that is still wondering what its identity is,

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 a city that is still trying to struggle with the mourning and the grief of all the things that have happened.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Could it be that perhaps the one thing Hong Kong needs the most in this hour is more beauty?

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Could it actually be that beauty could save the world?

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Well, maybe not the kind of beauty that we often think of when we hear that word.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 You know that kind of beauty, right?

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 You know the aesthetic, subjective kind of beauty?

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 The beauty that gets thrown at us by advertisers and the media,

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 and the beauty that seems to fill our social media feeds,

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 the beauty that's trying to tell us and shape us and to make us think that this particular look,

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 this particular way, this particular trend is what is now deemed and classified as beautiful.

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Is it that kind of beauty that can have something to say to suffering?

59
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 I don't know, because that beauty for me seems very fickle.

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 That beauty seems to be at the whim of everybody's opinion.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 That beauty we've been taught from a very young age is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 In other words, that beauty is defined by the one who defines it.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Like you see something and you define it and declare it beautiful,

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 but somebody else might see the very same thing and might see it as ugliness.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Is it really that fickle beauty that could save the world?

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I think we see this so much in the art world.

67
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I went on to Google this week and I just looked for a random piece of art,

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 and here's what I found.

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Probably the most famous piece of art that has ever been created.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa in 1517.

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 He was painting, apparently, the wife of a merchant.

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Her name was Lisa del Giocondo.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 When he showed this painting, when he released this painting,

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 it really was a showstopper.

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 People were really wondering what this was all about.

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 You can still go and see this painting.

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 I had the privilege on my sabbatical in 2019 to go to the Louvre.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 You queue for hours and you wind yourself up this staircase,

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 and you get into this room, and it's a big, massive room,

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 and you're only allowed to stand about 15 meters away from this painting.

81
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It's a pretty small painting.

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 It's like a postage stamp right in front of you, and you're staring at it,

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 and you're thinking, "Is this what it's all about?"

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Like this?

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Let me ask you a question.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Is she beautiful?

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Some of you in this room might say, "Well, yeah, she is.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 She's a timeless beauty. There's a timelessness.

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 There's a wonder to her, her expression, who she is.

90
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 There's lots of questions she raises for us.

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Yeah, she's beautiful."

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Some of you in this room might say, "She's beautiful for 1517."

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Maybe back then in 1517 to be a bit morose and dark and down

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 and not really smile was hot.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Maybe she was hot in 1517.

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Or some of you are sitting in the room here, and you're looking at this,

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 and you're like, "No. She is not beautiful.

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 There is nothing beautiful about her at all."

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 In fact, there's actually--this is a true story--

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 there's actually a whole group of people in art history

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 who believe that she's so ugly that she cannot be the wife of a prominent merchant,

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 and instead Leonardo was actually painting his male apprentice,

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 whose name is Salide.

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 It's a true story.

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So let me ask you a better question.

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Is the painting beautiful?

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Like is this actual work of art beautiful to you?

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And again, some of you in this room would say, "Well, I think it is.

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It's a masterpiece."

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I mean, look at how Leonardo painted this thing,

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 the colors that he brought out, the depth of it, the beautiful shades,

112
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I mean, the brush strokes.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 It is an absolute masterpiece.

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 But some of you, again, like this group of art historians,

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 would look at it and go, "Well, you know what?

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 There were a lot better pieces that he painted.

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 In fact, this is one of the worst things that he ever did."

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And we realize that beauty is so fickle.

119
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It's so up to interpretation.

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 It's so subjective.

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 How can this idea of beauty have anything at all

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 to say to the profound universality of suffering,

123
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 suffering that is felt by all of us?

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 How can the fickleness of beauty have anything to say to that?

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Well, maybe we're actually defining beauty wrong.

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Maybe actually the Bible has something to say about beauty

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 that we all need to re-remember.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 The Bible actually has a lot to say about the concept of beauty,

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 even though we don't preach and teach much about it in our pulpits.

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 In fact, beauty is mentioned in Scripture over 1,000 times,

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 some 600 times in the Old Testament,

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 about 400 times in the New Testament.

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And when it's mentioned, it has very little, often,

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 to do with aesthetic, subjective, physical beauty.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 What it's actually much more about

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 is the idea of the description of what feels and what looks

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 and what is beautiful.

138
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It's actually to do with something far grander and bigger

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 than just your opinion about something.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 In the last month or so as I was preparing for this series,

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I did the hard work of looking at the majority of these references,

142
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 and I boiled them all down to two slides.

143
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Are you ready?

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 This is beauty in the Old Testament.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 These kinds of words--impressive, glorified, splendor, agreeable,

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 this wholeness, coveting, pleasant, goodness, perfection--

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 at the top there, glory.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 The overarching emphasis in the Old Testament about beauty

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 is the idea of the concept of splendor and majesty and wonder and glory.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Like beauty is not subjective aestheticism.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Beauty has something to say or is about something

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 that is objective and in the world.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And often when beauty is spoken about,

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 it's directed to the wonder, the glory, the majesty,

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 and the splendor of God.

156
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 In the New Testament, a similar theme continues.

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And so we see free from defect, agreeable, as it should be,

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 radiant, fame, glory, honor, structure, sublime, appropriate,

159
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 lovely, fine.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 The idea here is that things are as they should be.

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 In other words, the concept of beauty in Scripture

162
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 is not about how you feel about looking at something.

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 The concept of beauty is whether something is as it was originally created

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 and designed to be.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 If it is, then there is beauty in it

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 because it represents something of the way God had always intended for it.

167
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 See, beauty in Scripture is a lot less to do

168
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 with this idea of physical aestheticness

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 and so much more to do with the concept of glory.

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Something is beautiful if it projects beyond itself

171
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 to some objective divine goodness.

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 If our lives project beyond ourselves to some objective, defined, radiant,

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 incredible divine goodness,

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 then our lives are deemed in God's biblical concept to be beautiful.

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And I wonder whether you're going to wake up tomorrow,

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 you're going to look in the mirror, and I wonder what you'll see.

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Will you see something beautiful as God would declare and design it

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 and declare it to be, or will you see something

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 that you see reflected back in you, all the wrinkles,

180
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 all the things that you don't want to see, the excess flab,

181
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 and all of that stuff?

182
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And is that going to actually define who you are?

183
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 The Bible would say that beauty points us to the goodness

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 and the orderness and the shalom and the peace of God.

185
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 This concept is right there at the start of our biblical story.

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Genesis 1 and 2 is a story of beauty.

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 We see right at the beginning of Genesis 1, there's this devoidness,

188
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 there's this darkness, the world is formless and shapeless.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 It's like a void, but we're told that the Holy Spirit

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 is hovering over the shapelessness, the formlessness of darkness,

191
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 waiting to bring it into action.

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And God speaks, and in that speech, the Holy Spirit moves,

193
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 and out of chaos comes some order.

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And God creates, and He forms, and He shapes.

195
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And at the end of the first day, He declares something

196
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 over what He's made.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Do you remember what He declares?

198
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 He says, "It is..."

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Come on.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Those are the people who are on staff who got paid who made that answer.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Come on, guys. Let's go. Sunday School 101.

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Sunday School 101. He declares, "It is good."

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Now, when God says, "It is good," at the end of the day of creation,

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 He's not making a moral, ethical statement.

205
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 He's not saying, "This is morally good."

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 No. What God is saying is, "There was chaos, formlessness, darkness, void.

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Now there's land and water and animals and birds and trees,

208
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 and it's just as I designed it to be.

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 This is good."

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 The word "good" there is actually translated in Hebrew, "beauty."

211
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 This is God saying, "This is beautiful."

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 He's not saying, "Morally good."

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 He's saying, "Wow! Can you check out what I did?"

214
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I mean, "This is amazing. It's beautiful."

215
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Why? Because it was chaotic.

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Now it's ordered and structured, and there's life,

217
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 an interrelational relationship in it.

218
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 This is why at the end of the sixth day,

219
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 He creates the pinnacle of His creation, humanity, you and me.

220
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And at the end of that day, He doesn't say, "It's good."

221
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 He says, "It's very good."

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Like there's an extra emphasis of beauty in humanity.

223
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And you might ask yourself, "Why?" when you look around this room.

224
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And it's because all of us have been made in the image of God.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 And what the Bible says in Genesis 1 and 2 is,

226
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 not only has God created a beautiful world,

227
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 He's then created beautiful humanity, and He tells them to do something.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 You remember? He says, "I want you to go now and steward all of creation.

229
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I want you to multiply, fill the earth, and look after all of creation."

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 In other words, you've seen me take nothingness and bring it into orderness.

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Now go and look after that creation by partnering with me

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 to continue to bring order and structure and shalom and peace in the world.

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 So I want you to know this.

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Right at the fabric of what it means for you to be human

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 is to be a purveyor of beauty in the biblical understanding.

236
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Because beauty is this work of taking things that are broken and wrong

237
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 and messy and suffering and all of that stuff

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 and bringing it into a place of order and goodness and shalom and peace.

239
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And when we as humans participate in that, we are beautiful.

240
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Which is a real problem.

241
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Because in Genesis 3, we have the story of humanity being given the great task

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 of turning the world into more and more beauty.

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And what do we do?

244
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Through our own choices, we take order and we move it back into chaos.

245
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 We undo a lot of what God had done right there in Genesis 1 and 2.

246
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And what was beautiful and right and good and shalom,

247
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 humanity chooses to take back into a place of disarray and chaos.

248
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And from Genesis 4 onwards, the rest of the biblical story

249
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 is basically God coming again through the work of humanity

250
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 and eventually through the sending of His Son Jesus

251
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 to show us this movement once again from chaos into order.

252
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Because that movement beautifies the work of God.

253
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 This is why beauty is about glory.

254
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 This is why humanity has been called to be beautiful.

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Not to be aesthetically pleasing.

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 But to dedicate our lives to bringing order.

257
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 So, if I was to give you a biblical definition of beauty,

258
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I would say this, beauty is the objective creative force of God

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 to bring order out of chaos.

260
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Think about that for a second.

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Beauty is the objective creative force of God to bring order out of chaos.

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And we get to see this ultimately in the person of Jesus Christ.

263
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Because Jesus, fully human and fully God, comes to this earth

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 and through His life and His death and His resurrection,

265
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He shows us what it is to actually finally take that chaos

266
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 and bring it back into order again.

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And that through Jesus' work on the cross and the blood that He sheds,

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 what He's offering to humanity is to step into that place of beauty.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 To step into that place where the chaos of our own lives

270
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 and the sin that we struggle with and all the stuff that's going on for us

271
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 can be exchanged by His mercy and His forgiveness and His salvation

272
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 so we could know life again.

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 The whole biblical journey and the story is one of beauty.

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Can beauty save the world?

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Oh, yes, it can.

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And in fact, beauty is currently at work in you.

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 This is why when you read all the scripture passages about beauty,

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 it's pointing towards this idea of order out of chaos.

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Let me give you some quick examples.

280
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It starts in Isaiah 52 verse 7.

281
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Isaiah 52 verse 7 says, "How beautiful are the feet of Him who brings good news."

282
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's not talking about some aesthetic perfect pedicure.

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 It's not saying, "Wow, look at your feet. Aren't they beautiful?"

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 It's saying, "Your feet are bringing good news, the gospel,

285
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 the hope of the life of the world, the idea of order coming out of chaos

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 to anybody who moves on the mountains,

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 anybody who moves in their offices, moves in their homes,

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 moves in their relationship to offer hope and order and structure

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 and peace and renewal and revival through the hope of Jesus.

290
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You are beautiful because you're partnering with that movement of God

291
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 from chaos to order.

292
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 This is why Ecclesiastes in chapter 3 says it this way,

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 "He has made everything beautiful in its time

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 for He has set eternity in the human heart."

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 God stands over all of time, holds eternity in His hands,

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 and He looks at everything, and He says, "I might see some darkness still.

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 There might be some shapeless and formlessness,

298
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 but my Holy Spirit is hovering over it right now,

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 hovering over your life right now, all the stuff that's going on for you.

300
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 The Holy Spirit is hovering right there, and He's set eternity in our hearts."

301
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 In other words, we long to be renewed.

302
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 We long. We have that hole in our hearts

303
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 that longs to say, "I don't want to be a part of this brokenness.

304
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I need salvation. I need redemption. I want life."

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And that eternity is set in our hearts, and God stands over that,

306
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 and He says, "It's beautiful because I'm moving you from chaos to order."

307
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Have a look at what Peter says to the early church.

308
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 "Your beauty should not come from outward appearance,

309
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Rather, it should be that of your inner self,

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 the unfading beauty of a gentle and ordered spirit,

312
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 which is of great worth in God's sight."

313
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Here is beauty, a gentle and ordered--note that word--

314
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 not chaotic, not stressed out, not causing lots of division,

315
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 not annoying everybody around you, not being that prickly friend,

316
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 actually being ordered, structured, sensible,

317
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 having allowed the Holy Spirit to continue to work on your flaws.

318
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 We know none of us are perfect, but submitting ourselves

319
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 to the chipping away of the work of the Spirit of God in our lives,

320
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 as we do that, that's beautiful in God's sight

321
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 because we show something of the beauty of His glory,

322
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 things just as they were designed to be,

323
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 which brings me back to flowers and funerals, to suffering and beauty.

324
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Can suffering change the world?

325
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Can beauty actually have something to say to our brokenness and our pain and our hurt?

326
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Not ascetic, subjective beauty, no,

327
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 but the kind of beauty that the Bible defines as bringing order out of chaos.

328
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 When we take that flower to the funeral, we're not being offensive to those in the room.

329
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 What we're saying is this is a prophetic reminder that the Lord is still at work.

330
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 This is a prophetic reminder to you that it isn't all this brokenness and this hurt and this suffering.

331
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Look at the wonder and the beauty of this flower.

332
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It points to the reality that is beyond the moment being felt now,

333
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 that there is something good in the heart of God, and He is at work.

334
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 We want to give something beautiful to remind ourselves and those around us in the moment.

335
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 It's the hardest moments in life.

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 That that suffering is not the full reality.

337
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 There is something else, and beauty has something to say to our suffering.

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 This idea is embedded in Scripture so deeply and so beautifully,

339
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 and it's one that I think as Christians, if we begin to reimagine and re-understand,

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 that we begin to redefine the world's perspective of beauty into biblical understanding,

341
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 we actually begin to understand the power that God has placed in us by His Spirit to bring hope into the world.

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Let me just share one real quick passage with you to give you a sense of this.

343
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 This is from Isaiah 61, verse 3 onwards.

344
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Let me read this to you. Is everybody okay?

345
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Yeah.

346
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 She's crying out in beauty. That's beauty.

347
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Isaiah 61, verse 3.

348
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 "For the God will provide for those who grieve in Zion,

349
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,

350
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 the oil of gladness instead of mourning,

351
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.

352
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord,

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 for the display of His splendor."

354
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Or you could say, "a display of His glory."

355
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 The word there in the Hebrew could be translated,

356
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 "a display of His beauty."

357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Isaiah is prophesying into Israel at a moment of their history where for 70 years they've been in exile.

358
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 70 years they've been struggling in exile, having been ripped out of their home in Jerusalem,

359
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 many of them killed, now in captivity in Babylon.

360
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And Isaiah writes them in a time of national mourning and grieving.

361
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 In a time where Israel is wondering, "What's next for us?

362
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 How do we change? How do we grow?

363
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 How do we actually rebuild our relationship with God?"

364
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And God shows up and He says, "I'm going to do something.

365
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I'm about to act again to take you out of your chaos and bring you back into order."

366
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And He prophetically declares the start of that with some beautiful imagery.

367
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 He says, "I'm going to replace your ashes for a crown of beauty."

368
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 There we go. He uses the concept of beauty and suffering,

369
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 and He brings them side by side.

370
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And He says an exchange is about to take place.

371
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 This imagery is important.

372
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 You see, in Israel when you were suffering or you were mourning or grieving in those days,

373
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 you would do it publicly.

374
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So often in our kind of Western and Eastern backgrounds we would do it privately.

375
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 In the Middle Eastern traditions they did it publicly.

376
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And the way they did that was by covering their head with ashes,

377
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 literally like pouring on top of their head, all over their clothes, ashes.

378
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And they would sit often in the center of the town square

379
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 and they would mourn publicly.

380
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And it was a way of declaring that mourning,

381
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 but it was also a way of inviting others in that community to come and join them in that mourning

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 because the mourning was a community experience.

383
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 And the ashes symbolized publicly that mourning was taking place.

384
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And it's like God is saying, "I know in your 70 years of exile, Israel,

385
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 that you're in this time of mourning.

386
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 You've got ashes on your head.

387
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 But I'm about to replace those ashes with this idea of a crown of beauty."

388
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 The Hebrew word there is like a tiara.

389
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 It's actually the idea, and it was used often in Israelite weddings,

390
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 a tiara for the bride in the wedding.

391
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And he says, "Rather than heaping ashes on your head,

392
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I'm going to actually give you a tiara like what you would get at a wedding."

393
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 In other words, the thing that symbolizes love and life and hope and goodness, beauty.

394
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I'm giving it to you as a replacement for those ashes.

395
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Now, I want you to see something really important here.

396
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 There's a small word.

397
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 It says "instead."

398
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 He doesn't say, and this is how we so often interpret this passage,

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 he doesn't say, "I'm going to take your ashes,

400
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 and I'm going to gather them all up.

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I'm going to shape and mold them.

402
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I'm going to work on them with my hands.

403
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 I'm going to chip away at them,

404
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and I'm going to create something beautiful out of your ashes."

405
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 That's often how we translate this passage,

406
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 and I actually do think God works that way.

407
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 There are other biblical passages that show us that work of God

408
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 to take our brokenness and to reshape and reform it.

409
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 But in this moment, that's not what God's speaking about.

410
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 He doesn't say, "I'm going to gather up your ashes and reshape them."

411
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 He says, "I'm going to completely replace them.

412
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 Instead of the ashes gone completely,

413
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I'm going to place on your head a tiara of beauty."

414
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Because beauty has the power to exchange the grip of suffering and death.

415
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Because beauty is about the restoration of order

416
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 where there has been before chaos.

417
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 This is why at the end of the passage it says

418
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 that we might then become a display of His splendor.

419
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 There is nothing more beautiful in this world

420
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 than jars of clay like you and I,

421
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 who can testify to the beauty in us

422
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 because God has taken some of our chaos,

423
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 and by His grace, He's made it a little bit more ordered.

424
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And this beauty is exchanged

425
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 because what God is doing here is He's pointing forward prophetically

426
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 to the work of Jesus on the cross.

427
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Because on the cross, Jesus doesn't gather up all of our sin.

428
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He doesn't try to reshape it and reform it

429
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 and chip away at it and kind of go, "Okay, here's you 2.0."

430
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 On the cross, Jesus exchanges our sin for His liberation and grace.

431
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 He exchanges our death for His life.

432
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 This is why when Paul writes of it, he says,

433
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 "In Christ Jesus, we are new creations."

434
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Not just a little bit better versions of the old stuff,

435
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 completely made new because there's an exchange that happens on the cross.

436
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 That's the power of the beauty of God.

437
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Are you with me?

438
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So when God moves in that way, it's an invitation to us

439
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 to think about our lives and ourselves as these objects

440
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 and these worth and these movements of beauty

441
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 that we get to, like it was called in Genesis 1 and 2,

442
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 to be purveyors of beauty in our context right now.

443
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 And that's very good news, my friends, for Hong Kong.

444
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 See, I think the church in Hong Kong needs to recapture the vision of beauty.

445
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 I think we need to actually begin to gather around ourselves

446
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 and say, "How do we walk and move and live more beautifully in this time

447
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 than ever before?"

448
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And those moments where we partner with the Holy Spirit

449
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 to see little things come into order out of the chaos in our lives

450
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 are the things that testify most beautifully and powerfully

451
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 to the glory of God.

452
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 So we do this in small and big ways.

453
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 Imagine that moment where you're sitting there with your child

454
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 and your child's hair is all messed up and knotted,

455
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 and you take your hairbrush and you gently and lovingly

456
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 knot out all of those knots into the straight, beautiful hair.

457
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Guess what? You're ushering in beauty.

458
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Or how about when that broken relationship in your life,

459
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 that you've decided to take the time to humble yourself

460
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 and work on that relationship to admit where you've been wrong

461
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 and to ask for forgiveness and to work hard at restoring that relationship,

462
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 you're ushering in beauty.

463
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Or that moment in a business meeting where suddenly you get this revelation,

464
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 this idea, and you get some idea that helps to navigate the company

465
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 beyond the things that was happening right now

466
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 and take it into that new place or that new project

467
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 or begin a new life there, you're ushering in beauty.

468
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Next week, I'm going to take this to the next step and say,

469
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 "What does it actually mean for us to be these ushers of beauty in Hong Kong

470
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 in this time?"

471
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 I'm going to share some things next week that will help you to understand

472
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 what that next step is for you in this area of beauty.

473
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 But before then, tomorrow when you wake up and look in the mirror,

474
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 what are you going to see?

475
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Are you going to see all your wrinkles and imperfections and pimples

476
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 and excess flab?

477
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 Are you going to see just ashes and declare yourself ugly?

478
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Or are you going to be able to stand back from that

479
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 and actually recapture a biblical vision of beauty

480
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 and say that despite my imperfections, despite that excess flab,

481
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 there is structure and order and shalom and goodness and repentance

482
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 and renewal and revival and change and restoration going on in my life.

483
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I am not the same person I was a year ago.

484
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 By the grace of God, that is beautiful.

485
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 That I might see something in my life go from chaos to order.

486
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 But not only that, I might partner with the Holy Spirit to come around

487
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 and see other people in my life move from a place of chaos

488
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 into a place of order.

489
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 When that takes place, God stands back and He goes,

490
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 "That is very good."

491
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 I wonder if you'd pray with me. Let's pray.

492
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Father, I thank you for each person in this room.

493
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Lord, I thank you for who we are, the diversity, the uniqueness,

494
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 men and women of Christ, people of yours in this moment.

495
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Father, we come now just before you.

496
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 And we know this area of beauty is challenging for each one of us.

497
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And there are some of us in this room that really struggle with this.

498
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 And maybe you've never even been able to ever look at yourself

499
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 or declare yourself beautiful.

500
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 But you only ever see the things that you perceive as being wrong with you.

501
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 In some ways, being stuck in Genesis 3,

502
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 taking order and bringing it into chaos again.

503
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Some of you do feel like ashes are over you.

504
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 My prayer for you this morning is that through what we've been sharing,

505
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 there might be a shift for you in how you perceive yourself.

506
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 That you might begin to think of beauty in a different way.

507
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And it will be hard. It will take practice.

508
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Because we're so ingrained in what the world is trying to tell us

509
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 about aesthetic subjective beauty.

510
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 But you need to know that there is an objective divine goodness

511
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 and glory and splendor and majesty that is beauty in this world.

512
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And that you, as his beloved child, redeemed by his Savior Jesus,

513
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 given grace and hope in life, you are his work of art.

514
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 You are beautiful.

515
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And for some of you, that's going to be a liberating idea.

516
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 For some of you, that's hard to receive, but it's still truth.

517
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 And I want to encourage you this week

518
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 to allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you about yourself.

519
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 How you perceive yourself.

520
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And allow him to begin to show you the ways that he has brought

521
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 so much order out of the chaos in your life.

522
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And it's easy for us to continue to see chaotic things taking place in our lives.

523
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 But ask him to give you his perspective.

524
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 He has set eternity in your heart.

525
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Ask him to show you where you've come, the journey you've been on.

526
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Who you are today versus who you were five years ago.

527
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And glorify him, worship him because of that.

528
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 That his Spirit has been in work, taking you from chaos to order.

529
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And maybe just this week, it's a chance for you to worship him in a fresh new way.

530
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And perhaps in that, you might begin to then reflect

531
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 on what we're going to be talking about next week.

532
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 How might you then be partnering with the Spirit of God

533
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 to see more beauty come in this world?

534
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 To see more order come in the chaotic things around us?

535
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 For our city, for our neighborhoods, our communities, for this church.

536
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 How might we begin to live out this call to partner with God

537
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 to see order come through chaos?

538
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Father, we thank you so much that your power and your presence is with us.

539
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 We thank you that you are shaping and forming each person here.

540
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And we thank you that it is all for your glory.

541
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 You are so beautiful, Lord.

542
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Would you replace our ashes, exchange them for your glory.

543
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

544
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Everyone says, "Amen."

545
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 Would you stand with me?
