2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,600
 Imagine with me for a moment a church.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,560
 This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,440
 but a church in the plural, united across a nation, joined in purpose,

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,400
 focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,760
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,360
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,840
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,680
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,480
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,080
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,880
 transforming God's people for God's work,

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,920
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,680
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,600
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,880
 as integral to all that it's called to be and do,

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,760
 involving intentional, committed, and authentic relationships

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,000
 across all levels.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,680
 It is the sort of place where both the young and the old

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,480
 feel cared for, supported, and equipped.

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,760
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,560
 come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic that honors and embraces

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,040
 the richness and diversity that marks us as the body of Christ.

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,920
 It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,800
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,800
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,520
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,360
 where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,240
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,880
 A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,360
 mark of its existence, but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,040
 a time of service, love, and engagement that inspires and emboldens

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,320
 all equally for the conversation that lies ahead.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,480
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

36
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,760
 This is our city.

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
 This is our church.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
 This is our home.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,440
 And good morning, everyone.

40
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,240
 You guys OK?

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,160
 I know it's pouring outside, so I'm so glad you could all made it here safe.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,440
 Can we put our hands together just to welcome those around you?

43
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,520
 I know how hard it is to come in here today.

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
 I know.

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,360
 I was just tapping on Tim's shoulder, and I'm like, oh, it's all wet.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,320
 So I understand the effort you have to put in in order to make it here today.

47
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,080
 I really, really appreciate that, and we're so happy to see you all.

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,880
 And we'll be praying for those who are still on their way.

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,240
 We can see today, like, the weather, the rain is definitely

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 one of the things that are trying to stop us from coming here.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,200
 But anyway, we're here.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,920
 You know, we've been talking about healing in our church

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,520
 in the last couple of weeks.

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,320
 And I just want to see if anybody, like, you've

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,560
 been prayed for in the last couple of weeks,

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,240
 and you felt, wow, like, God really touched me.

57
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,120
 He really, like, spoke to me.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,600
 Or even He really healed me.

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,760
 Is there anyone, like, you feel that?

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,000
 OK, one or two.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,120
 Yeah, great.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,800
 And has any one of you said, hey, I want more of that.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,680
 Like, I really want to experience that kind of healing.

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,040
 Can I invite you to stand?

65
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,400
 This is really between, like--

66
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,680
 first of all, this is really between, like, you and God.

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,560
 But last week, Pastor Ivan in the Cantonese service,

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,960
 he mentioned something.

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,040
 He said that healing is not just about the individual.

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,920
 When one of us experience that healing,

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,120
 God actually wants the whole community,

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,920
 the whole spiritual family to experience that together.

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,760
 And this is why we're here.

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,680
 Maybe you are the one who needs that healing.

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,960
 Maybe it's the person right next to you.

76
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,600
 But as their neighbors, as a spiritual family, a community,

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,360
 this is something that God calls us into together.

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,320
 So we're here to welcome the presence of God.

79
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,040
 Maybe you're only-- maybe you said,

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,880
 I'm really doing OK, Chapman.

81
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,320
 I'm happy for you.

82
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,360
 But your posture, your attitude to welcome the Spirit of God

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,840
 into this room, that helps the person next to you

84
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
 to experience God as well.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,480
 Can we do that for ourselves or for the neighbors?

86
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
 Is that all right?

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
 Shall we pray together?

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,920
 Let's close our eyes.

89
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,480
 And why don't you, in your own words, in your own language,

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,960
 why don't you welcome God's Spirit?

91
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,320
 You welcome His presence into this room.

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,880
 Why don't you do it, church?

93
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,440
 Let's just spend 30 seconds.

94
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,680
 Let's just lift up our voice and say, God,

95
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,560
 we welcome you in this place in your own way.

96
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,480
 Let's do that, church.

97
00:05:42,480 --> 00:06:03,280
 God, we want to make room for you.

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,800
 We want to encounter you in this place.

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,600
 We're not here to rush through a program.

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,960
 We're not here to go through the motions.

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,200
 We're here just to make sure we're making time for you,

102
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,200
 we're making room for you.

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,080
 And so come, Holy Spirit.

104
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:31,560
 I pray you would usher in that healing, that joy, that love

105
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,440
 that we already have, that we already

106
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,280
 seen on the cross of Jesus.

107
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,240
 We just pray that you would make that our reality today

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,840
 in our worship, in our service, in our hearing of your word

109
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,520
 here today, Lord.

110
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,440
 We pray that every heart be open in this room to you today,

111
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,480
 Lord.

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,800
 Let us lift up a shout to you.

113
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,760
 We rejoice with heaven that we have a Savior that

114
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,160
 cares about us, that loves us, that is right here,

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 right now with us.

116
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,120
 We love you, Jesus.

117
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,760
 We thank you for being here by your Holy Spirit.

118
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,680
 Let's sing, church.

119
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,560
 Let's worship him.

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:26,560
 Sing with Jesus.

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:40,360
 My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:51,760
 All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.

123
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,760
 My comfort.

124
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,760
 My comfort.

125
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,240
 My shelter.

126
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,240
 Tower of refuge and strength.

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:17,760
 Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.

128
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,720
 Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.

129
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,720
 Power and majesty praise to the King.

130
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,720
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roll

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,720
 at the sound of your name.

132
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,720
 I sing for joy at the work of your hands.

133
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.

134
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.

135
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:21,720
 My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.

136
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:32,720
 All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,720
 My comfort.

138
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
 My shelter.

139
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,720
 Tower of refuge and strength.

140
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.

141
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,720
 Let's sing it out.

142
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,720
 Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.

143
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,720
 Power and majesty praise to the King.

144
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,720
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roll

145
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,720
 at the sound of your name.

146
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,720
 I sing for joy at the work of your hands.

147
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,720
 Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.

148
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,720
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.

149
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 Shout to the Lord on the earth, let us sing.

150
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,720
 Power and majesty praise to the King.

151
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,720
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roll

152
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,720
 at the sound of your name.

153
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 I sing for joy at the work of your hands.

154
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,720
 Forever I love you, forever I'll stand.

155
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,720
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.

156
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,720
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.

157
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:38,720
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.

162
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 You give life.

163
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
 You are love.

164
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,720
 You bring light to the darkness.

165
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,720
 You give hope.

166
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:36,720
 You restore every heart that is broken.

167
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,720
 Great are you, Lord.

168
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
 Sing again.

169
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,720
 You give life.

170
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 You give life.

171
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
 You are love.

172
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,720
 You bring light to the darkness.

173
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 You give hope.

174
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:08,720
 You restore every heart that is broken.

175
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 Great are you, Lord.

176
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
 It's your breath.

177
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,720
 It's your breath in our lungs.

178
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,720

 So we pour out our praise to you only.

234
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:46,720
 Singing great are you, Lord.

235
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 Singing great are you, Lord.

236
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 Singing great are you, Lord.

237
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,720
 Singing great are you, Lord.

238
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 It's your breath.

239
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,720

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:35,720
 So we pour out our praise to you only.

244
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 >> Let's just remain in this spirit of worship.

245
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,720
 Remain in this place.

246
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,720
 As we were worshiping, I just had this sense that God's telling us, hey, no rush.

247
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 It's okay.

248
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
 I know it's raining heavily outside.

249
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 I know it feels like a bad day today.

250
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,720
 I know things don't work according to what you have planned.

251
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 That's okay.

252
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
 No rush.

253
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,720
 We don't have to rush through the songs or, you know, go through the program.

254
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,720
 Come enjoy his presence.

255
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,720
 >> Church, I just want to invite you as we were singing just now, it's your breath in our lungs.

256
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 Right now I just want to invite us to take a deep breath together.

257
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,720
 And you sense that it's God's breath in our lungs.

258
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,720
 You sense his presence even inside your own body.

259
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,720
 It's his presence, it's his breath, it's his Holy Spirit.

260
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 In Genesis it says God breathed his holy breath.

261
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:01,720
 God breathed his holy breath into a powder of mud and that became a person, a living being.

262
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:10,720
 It's his breath inside of us that gives us life, that made us really, really alive.

263
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,720
 And maybe some of us we need that today.

264
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,720
 Maybe you are going through this thing called life but you don't really feel alive inside.

265
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:29,720
 Maybe you're going through like you have your job, you have your duties, you are just trying to drag yourself through the week and you don't really feel alive.

266
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,720
 But today God says I want to breathe inside of you so you will be truly alive here in this place.

267
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:48,720
 If that's you church, let's just take a deep breath right now and allow the Holy Spirit to come fill you up once again.

268
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:57,720
 When we were singing just now I heard God is saying, you know what Chapman, I want to encounter you guys more than you guys want to encounter me here today.

269
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,720
 I want to encounter you guys. I want to breathe my breath into every one of you here today.

270
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,720
 I want every one of you to be truly alive today.

271
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,720
 It's no rush. My sons, my daughters, you don't have to rush.

272
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 I'm here. I want to spend this time with you.

273
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,720
 God is your breath in our lungs.

274
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:39,720
 Worship it's not work. Worship it's not the thing we do, the songs we sing because it's a Sunday morning.

275
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:46,720
 Worship it's just us realizing God is you.

276
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 It's your breath in my lungs. I'm going to use that breath to bring worship to you, to sing to you, to bring praise to you today here.

277
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:09,720
 Let's do that church. Let's worship Him.

278
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 You give life.

279
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,720
 You are love.

280
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 You bring light to the darkness.

281
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
 You give hope.

282
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:32,720
 You restore every heart that is broken.

283
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,720
 Great are you Lord.

284
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,720
 It's your breath in our lungs.

285
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 So we pour out our praise.

286
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 Pour out our praise.

287
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
 It's your breath in our lungs.

288
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,720

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:34,720
 Great are you Lord.

361
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:44,720
 Great are you Lord.

362
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:54,720
 Great are you Lord.

363
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:04,720
 Great are you Lord.

364
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:14,720
 Great are you Lord.

365
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:24,720
 Great are you Lord.

366
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:34,720
 Great are you Lord.

367
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:44,720
 Great are you Lord.

368
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:54,720
 He that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you.

369
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,720
 It's this word that quicken that's really kind of catching in my spirit.

370
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,720
 We need God's spirit that lives in Tim, in this man, in this man of God.

371
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:15,720
 We need that spirit to quicken, to speed up his work of healing in his mortal body at this time.

372
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:37,720
 Lord it has been long enough, months now, where this affliction has really caught him and laid him low and has really hampered his ability to really perform and to give his most and his utmost and his best to this church.

373
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:46,720
 Father I wanted to stand alongside this church and pray for our pastor Tim, for his complete and total healing.

374
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,720
 That the spirit that lives in him will quicken his mortal body in Jesus name.

375
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,720
 Thank you Father. Amen.

376
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
 Thank you.

377
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
 Bless you man.

378
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,720
 Appreciate it.

379
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
 Love you Tim.

380
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,720
 Thank you Nigel.

381
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
 That's the end of our worship.

382
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,720
 Thank you.

383
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
 We put our hands together to thank our worship team.

384
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,720
 Thank you for putting in the hard work to come and practice and come in early in the morning.

385
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,720
 Please grab a seat everyone.

386
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
 So good to see you all.

387
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
 Storm is really bad outside right?

388
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,720
 That means we're at the beginning of the spring or the summer season.

389
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
 I guess we're going to get more of that.

390
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,720
 So everybody just you know get ready for more storms.

391
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
 And that's why we need Jesus right?

392
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,720
 We need Jesus so he's with us when we're in the storms.

393
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,720
 And I also really want to extend a warm welcome to all of us.

394
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:51,720
 Welcome back once again for all of you who call the Vine like your home, your spiritual family.

395
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,720
 But I would also love to extend a warm welcome to those if you're visiting for the very first time or just want to come and check us out.

396
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,720
 I wonder if there's anyone you're new here in this community.

397
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
 We just want to say hello.

398
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
 Okay hello.

399
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
 I saw someone pointing at the other.

400
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
 Hi.

401
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
 Can we put our hands together to our friends?

402
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
 Hi.

403
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,720
 Good to see you.

404
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
 My name is Chapman by the way.

405
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,720
 I am one of the pastors here.

406
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
 I'm so happy to see you all.

407
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
 And you see this light behind me.

408
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
 It's been up there for a while.

409
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
 And there's a QR code.

410
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,720
 So we actually as a church we do have a WhatsApp channel that we normally like.

411
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,720
 It's kind of like a one-way kind of communication.

412
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,720
 We would update you all with information about the church here regularly.

413
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,720
 So you can scan this QR code if you would like to stay in touch with us.

414
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,720
 Your phone number will not be exposed.

415
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,720
 So we totally respect your privacy.

416
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,720
 And if you have previously, if you've been here maybe a couple months ago, sign up to the link.

417
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
 Just want to remind you that there's a new channel.

418
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
 There's some technical issues.

419
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
 So we started a new channel.

420
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,720
 If you haven't signed up to the new one, here's your chance.

421
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,720
 And yeah, we're just so happy to see you all here on a rainy day.

422
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,720
 I know like our kids, they're very excited to go to K4C right now.

423
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,720
 So without further ado, before we send them off, I also want to pray for them.

424
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,720
 So if you see any children around you, could you lay hands on them?

425
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,720
 Like just bless them or just stretch out your hands towards them.

426
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,720
 Father, we want to bless the children here.

427
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,720
 Father, we know that they're full of joy.

428
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
 They're full of energy.

429
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,720
 And Father, we know they're a very important part of this church.

430
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
 And so Father, we pray for them today.

431
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,720
 We pray that Lord, they will receive your Holy Spirit.

432
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
 They will receive your truth.

433
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,720
 And they will have so much fun in K4C today.

434
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
 We pray for our teachers, Father.

435
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,720
 We pray you anoint them with your wisdom, with your love.

436
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
 In Jesus' name we all pray.

437
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
 Everybody say, "Amen."

438
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
 All right, kids, see you.

439
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
 All right, K4C, who's leading K4C today?

440
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
 Teacher June and Jason, they're standing there.

441
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
 So, yes, go ahead.

442
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,720
 Have fun today.

443
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,720
 Yeah.

444
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
 Cool.

445
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
 And so for the rest of us, we're here.

446
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,720
 Why don't we just turn around, say hi to your neighbors.

447
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,720
 If they need a little bit of encouragement on a rainy day, just give them a bit of encouragement.

448
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,720
 Or just tell them how your week has been.

449
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,720
 All right.

450
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
 How was your week?

451
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,720
 Let them know.

452
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
 Or introduce yourself.

453
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
 I'll come back in a moment.

454
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
 [music]

455
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720

456
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720

457
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720

458
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720

459
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720

460

461

462

463
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,720
 [music]

464
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,720
 [music]

465
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,720

466
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,720

467
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,720

468
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
 [music]

469
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,720

470

471
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,720
 [music]

472
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:32,720
 Yeah, you know, some smiles, it will help brighten up the day, although it's still raining outside.

473
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,720
 Or if you need a cup of coffee, if that makes you better, remember now we have a coffee team.

474
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,720
 I think they're very happy to serve you coffee or they're very happy to give you a cup of happiness after service.

475
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
 Of course, you can always receive the Holy Spirit.

476
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,720
 That works as well.

477
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
 All right.

478
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
 A couple of announcements for us.

479
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:59,720
 First of all, we have a youth group volunteer session this afternoon at 2.30.

480
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
 We'll be meeting in the library.

481
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,720
 So if you have signed up already, just go grab lunch and come back at 2.30.

482
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,720
 If you haven't signed up but you're still interested, you're very welcome to join us as well.

483
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
 2.30, we'll see you there.

484
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,720
 And next week, we have a bring your own lunch.

485
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,720
 If you're here for the first couple of times, we do this every month towards the end of the month,

486
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,720
 or perhaps normally last week of the month.

487
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,720
 We gather as a church across the English and the Cantonese service.

488
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
 People would join together.

489
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,720
 We will have lunch here in this building.

490
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,720
 So bring your own food means, yes, you have to go and either pack your food or you cook and bring it back,

491
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
 and we'll enjoy lunch here together.

492
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,720
 It's a great opportunity to meet people you don't normally see.

493
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,720
 Or sometimes you sit in the service, you're on this side, but you never get to meet people on that side.

494
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,720
 So that's a great chance for you to meet different people in the church.

495
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,720
 Because we're a community, because church is not about coming to hear somebody speak for 30 minutes,

496
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,720
 it's about the community of God.

497
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
 Amen?

498
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,720
 Okay.

499
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
 There's one more thing.

500
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,720
 Any parents here?

501
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,720
 Any parents?

502
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,720
 Any parents?

503
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
 Any parents?

504
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
 No parents here?

505
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
 All the parents are gone?

506
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
 Oh, wow.

507
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
 Okay.

508
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
 That's okay.

509
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
 No parents here.

510
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
 Okay.

511
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,720
 If the parents are not here, it's even more important for you to hear this,

512
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,720
 because you have to pass this on to all those parents who are missing right now.

513
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
 Okay.

514
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,720
 Another parenting workshop, and this time it's in English.

515
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
 Can we get an amen?

516
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
 All right.

517
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,720
 Three months ago, I mean, in March, we did a Cantonese one.

518
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,720
 I know some of you are like, "Oh, I can't really understand the language."

519
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
 Okay.

520
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,720
 It's for you right now.

521
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,720
 It's for you and your friends, those who have kids, or you have kids around you.

522
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,720
 It's for their parents as well.

523
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
 So please save the date.

524
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
 It's happening on the 1st of June.

525
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
 It's a Saturday.

526
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,720
 We don't have a lot of Saturday activities or events, but it's coming up,

527
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,720
 and you will get a chance to come in on a Saturday if you're a parent, or you can bring friends as well.

528
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,720
 So just let me give you a bit of a heads up what that is.

529
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:06,720
 The topic of this parenting workshop would be cultivating self-awareness for effective parenting.

530
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,720
 So we're not telling you how to make the kids to be a little bit more self-aware.

531
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
 It's more about us as parents.

532
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,720
 We have to be first self-aware.

533
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:22,720
 So we want to encourage everyone who comes to reflect on their personal values and beliefs about parenting.

534
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,720
 We want to discuss different parenting styles and the impact on the relationship with their kids.

535
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
 We do want to explore some common emotions experienced by parents.

536
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
 I can't -- yeah, I know, I know.

537
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,720
 That's -- yeah, frustrations, and okay, I'm not going to just give you the list, but I experience that on a regular basis.

538
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,720
 So if you experience a lot of different types of emotions as parents, yes, this is for you.

539
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
 This is for you.

540
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:54,720
 And we also share strategies, you know, how we can do better as parents, how we can cope with our kids.

541
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
 Cope with our kids, yes, that's the right word.

542
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,720
 And how do you have empathy and compassion as parents.

543
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
 This is very important.

544
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,720
 So I'm going to sign up.

545
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,720
 I'm going to sign up.

546
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,720
 I'll see you there, all right?

547
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,720
 So even better this time, we heard you guys, or we heard whoever came last time, there's going to be childcare during the session.

548
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,720
 So if you're wondering, I'm the one, like, looking after my kids on a Saturday.

549
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,720
 Don't worry, bring them in, just dump them inside somewhere, and then just sit here and enjoy your time.

550
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,720
 And, you know, for, I don't know, one and a half hours, just forget about your kids.

551
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,720
 I'm telling myself, basically.

552
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,720
 So anyway, so more details coming.

553
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,720
 We'll give you a sign-up link later, but we just really want you to save the date.

554
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:48,720
 Or if you have people in mind, you know, when we talk about those emotions, like, oh, yes, my sister needs that, my brother needs that, you know, that's the time you can tell them, hey, save the date.

555
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,720
 There's a parenting workshop at my church in a couple of weeks' time.

556
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,720
 So, yeah, is that helpful for parents?

557
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,720
 Is it helpful for you guys who have friends who are parents?

558
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,720
 Yeah, all right, yeah, I'm sure parents, they all face those things I mentioned before.

559
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:11,720
 But, yeah, we're going to continue to worship God with tithes and offerings right now.

560
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,720
 And this is for those people who call this place your home church or you call yourselves a follower of Jesus.

561
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,720
 This is a way for us to express our gratitude to God.

562
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:30,720
 And, yeah, just as this scripture here says, like, each of us, we should give what you have decided in your heart to give.

563
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,720
 There's no pressure.

564
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,720
 As a church, we did share, like, what are the needs, how we would invite you all to partner with us.

565
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:53,720
 But we're equally, we're very grateful for the generosity of many of you in how you've been walking with this community and really giving, sowing seeds into responding to the needs that God shows us.

566
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:00,720
 And, yeah, so as we're coming together as a church, as we are sowing seeds into these parts.

567
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,720
 You know, there is a particular reason why we use flower pots for our offering.

568
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,720
 Of course, now we all do it digitally.

569
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
 Our QR codes are on the screen.

570
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,720
 But we use flower pots because it's an act of sowing seeds into God's kingdom.

571
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,720
 And we will continue to do that.

572
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,720
 We know it's not just for the running of the church.

573
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,720
 We thank you for that.

574
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,720
 But God has been bringing us into this community.

575
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,720
 He has work for us to do here, needs that we have to respond to.

576
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:36,720
 And your time and your offering, it's part of how we can making those kingdom initiatives possible.

577
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,720
 So can I invite you all to pray with me in light of that?

578
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,720
 Father, we thank you that you love Hong Kong.

579
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,720
 You love Yuen Long.

580
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,720
 And you brought this church here, this community here.

581
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,720
 You gather us, your people, your children.

582
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:58,720
 Father, we thank you that you first bless us so that we could be a blessing to those around us, to the community.

583
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:05,720
 And so, yeah, God, we just want to thank you for your generosity, your faithfulness in our lives, in our families, in our work.

584
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:15,720
 Father, we do want to come as a faithful community, a generous community to respond to those around us as well.

585
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,720
 So, Father, we just pray you would bless this offering.

586
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
 You would multiply.

587
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:26,720
 You would use it to meet the needs of many around us.

588
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,720
 Those who are parents, those who are single, those who are working, those who are in need of a job.

589
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,720
 Father, we just pray you know all of them.

590
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,720
 We just pray you would bring us to these people and serve them in their need.

591
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
 In Jesus' name we pray.

592
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
 Amen.

593
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,720
 Okay, right now I'm going to invite Pastor Tim back to the stage again.

594
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,720
 He is bringing the word to us again.

595
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,720
 We'll continue in a healing series, Longing for Healing.

596
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,720
 And Pastor Tim is going to bring us another message from his heart.

597
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,720
 Can we stretch our hands one more time?

598
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,720
 And we're going to pray for Tim as he's preparing to speak.

599
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,720
 Jesus, we just pray you would fill Pastor Tim with your Holy Spirit.

600
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,720
 I know you have put this entire series on his heart.

601
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,720
 You have put the healing of our people, healing of Yuen Long on his heart.

602
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,720
 So God, I just pray that today you would allow him to speak freely from his heart.

603
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,720
 You would fill him, Lord God.

604
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,720
 I know as he speaks from his heart, he's actually drawing from your heart as well.

605
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,720
 Father, I know how he has been spending time so that his heart is connected to yours.

606
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,720
 And so Father, today we open our ears to receive the message he's about to bring.

607
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
 In your name we pray.

608
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,720
 Amen.

609
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,720
 Well, thank you so much for your prayers.

610
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
 I really appreciate it.

611
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,720
 And yeah, we're talking about healing, right?

612
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
 So we want to pray for healing and ask for healing.

613
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:03,720
 And I think it's quite interesting that I'm experiencing my own trials in the middle of talking and preaching about healing.

614
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:10,720
 But I think that also reminds me and it gives me a good insider perspective again of that as well.

615
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,720
 But yeah, thank you for your prayers.

616
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,720
 Well, somebody close to me was rubbing me consistently the wrong way.

617
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,720
 Now, I don't know if you've experienced this.

618
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
 Maybe just a little bit, a tiny little bit.

619
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:32,720
 But over a period of time, it drives you crazy.

620
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,720
 And so inside of myself, frustration was starting to build up.

621
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
 Anyone with me on this?

622
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,720
 Yes?

623
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,720
 Okay, thank you.

624
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,720
 All right, I see you.

625
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,720
 And so I got to the point, I was like, I have to say something.

626
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,720
 I cannot just let this continue.

627
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,720
 So in my mind, I thought objectively, of course objectively, right?

628
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
 What I was going to share.

629
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,720
 So I made a plan.

630
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,720
 And then I stepped into the workspace and said, hey, there's something that we need to talk about.

631
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,720
 I want to talk about this.

632
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,720
 Let me know when it's a good time to talk about this.

633
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,720
 So I thought I've done my part.

634
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,720
 So I start walking out of the workspace.

635
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,720
 And he says, hey, you can't do this.

636
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,720
 You cannot bring up a problem and walk away.

637
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,720
 So obviously, there's a lot of like already intensity in that response.

638
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:36,720
 And let's say I reacted to that.

639
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,720
 And words were spoken that were meant to injure, to harm.

640
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,720
 There was anger.

641
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,720
 There was hostility.

642
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:54,720
 And even the threat of cutting off relationship was brought up in this conversation.

643
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,720
 And so everything ugly inside of me and inside the other person came out.

644
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,720
 I mean, it was just not pretty.

645
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,720
 I'm glad you didn't see it.

646
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,720
 And I don't know if you've ever had this in a fight where you cross a certain line.

647
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,720
 And you know you crossed the line.

648
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:24,720
 And then in your mind you think, well, now that we're at it, let me tell you everything I always wanted to say.

649
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,720
 Has anyone done that?

650
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,720
 All right.

651
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,720
 Yes.

652
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,720
 Don't do it.

653
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:32,720
 It's stupid.

654
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,720
 Nothing good comes out of it.

655
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,720
 But that's exactly, of course, what I did.

656
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,720
 I went for it.

657
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:50,720
 And honestly, in this conflict, I left this conflict shaking, trembling.

658
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,720
 I stepped out of the place.

659
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,720
 I went for a walk.

660
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,720
 And I was processing what had happened.

661
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,720
 And I was feeling hurt.

662
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,720
 I was upset.

663
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,720
 I was disappointed.

664
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:14,720
 And I've never, up until this point in my life, had ever experienced a rupture in a relationship like I did at that point in time.

665
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,720
 I mean, it was extreme.

666
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,720
 And there was a lot of pain.

667
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:32,720
 Now, C.S. Lewis, a well-known Christian author, he once said, "Forgiveness is lovely until you have something to forgive."

668
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,720
 Isn't that so true?

669
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:45,720
 It's easy to talk about forgiveness when there's nothing to forgive, but when someone really hurts you, then suddenly it's not that easy.

670
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,720
 Well, that's what I was experiencing in this moment.

671
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
 It was not easy.

672
00:53:50,720 --> 00:54:00,720
 And I have to be honest, even things that I had learned in seminary, things that I had picked up in church about forgiveness, they were not helpful.

673
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,720
 I just could not, for whatever reason, I really struggled to move towards forgiveness.

674
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:14,720
 So it was not one of those things where 15 minutes later, you're like, "Okay, let's reconcile. I forgive you."

675
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,720
 I'm a harmony person. I don't like conflict.

676
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,720
 So I want to resolve things.

677
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,720
 But in this case, I just was not able to let go of what happened.

678
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,720
 And I really wrestled with it.

679
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,720
 I mean, it was so difficult.

680
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,720
 And I just couldn't move forward.

681
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,720
 So what we're going to do, or I should share what happened, right?

682
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,720
 You're wondering.

683
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,720
 So after several months, this was a long period of time for me.

684
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,720
 I was able to forgive the person who hurt me.

685
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,720
 I also had to own, so it was not one of those things where I was just hurt.

686
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
 I also did some hurting.

687
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,720
 So I actually wrote the person and also asked for their forgiveness as well, trying to do my part.

688
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,720
 And so that's what happened there.

689
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:12,720
 Today, we are going to continue to talk about our Longing for Healing message series.

690
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,720
 And our topic is forgiveness.

691
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:21,720
 Now, we have been looking at that healing is found in no other name but the name of Jesus.

692
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:29,720
 That whether we are looking for physical, emotional, spiritual healing, mental healing, it is found in Jesus.

693
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:38,720
 Because He is powerful and He is able to help us when nobody else is able to help us and to bring healing into our lives.

694
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:46,720
 Then last week, we looked at how a lot of times we come to Jesus for healing with a lot of shame.

695
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:52,720
 And so we asked Jesus for one thing, maybe the obvious thing.

696
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,720
 But then Jesus challenges us and calls us to actually go deeper.

697
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,720
 Because He wants to bring a deeper healing in our lives.

698
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,720
 So you looked at the woman that was bleeding.

699
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,720
 And you saw that Jesus called her to step forward.

700
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,720
 And when she did, He restored her relationally.

701
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,720
 He removed her shame.

702
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:16,720
 And He just powerfully, in His loving presence, brought healing into her life.

703
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,720
 And today, the focus is on unforgiveness.

704
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:27,720
 A lot of times when you talk about forgiveness, we talk about us needing to forgive.

705
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,720
 And if the Holy Spirit convicts you of that, please by all means do that.

706
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:38,720
 But I want to focus on how we forgive those who have wronged us.

707
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,720
 Oh, that's not easy.

708
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:53,720
 But I believe that when we do that, that Jesus brings healing and relief to pain and feelings that we have been carrying around.

709
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,720
 And He wants to just set us free from that.

710
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,720
 He wants to get rid of that cloud that is hanging over you.

711
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,720
 So that's what we're going to explore today.

712
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,720
 Does that sound good?

713
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,720
 Yes.

714
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,720
 Yes?

715
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,720
 Okay.

716
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,720
 Alright, just checking.

717
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,720
 It didn't sound that convincing, but I think that's what we need to talk about.

718
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:20,720
 So we're in a famous, one of the most famous parts of the gospel.

719
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,720
 So I'm not going to give context.

720
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:25,720
 We're at the point where Jesus is about to be crucified.

721
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,720
 So I'm going to read Luke 23, starting in verse 33, it says this.

722
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,720
 "When they came to the place called Skull, they crucified Him there along with the criminals.

723
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,720
 One on His right and the other on His left.

724
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:48,720
 Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.'"

725
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,720
 Now just think about this.

726
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:57,720
 Jesus is just being nailed to the cross, and the first thing that He says is,

727
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,720
 "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."

728
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,720
 I mean, this is unexpected.

729
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,720
 Jesus had a horrible week.

730
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,720
 He was betrayed by His closest friends.

731
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,720
 He was abandoned by His closest friends.

732
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,720
 He was put on an unjust trial, where there was an unjust ruling.

733
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,720
 Then He was mocked.

734
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,720
 He was beaten.

735
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,720
 He had to carry His cross as far as He could.

736
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,720
 Then He was nailed to the cross.

737
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:36,720
 And so here, He is speaking forgiveness to all who had brought Him to this place in the first place.

738
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,720
 Now that is sobering and profound.

739
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:52,720
 Jesus was modeling something to us that was meant to characterize us as Christians,

740
00:58:52,720 --> 00:59:02,720
 a radical forgiveness for when we are wronged and when we are hurt.

741
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,720
 What a call this is to us.

742
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:10,720
 We already acknowledge that forgiveness is easy to talk about when you have nothing to forgive,

743
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,720
 but when we actually struggle with forgiveness, when somebody actually has wronged us and hurt us,

744
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
 this is not easy.

745
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,720
 But Jesus modeled it to us.

746
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,720
 And He calls us to be a people who forgive.

747
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,720
 So how do we move forward in forgiveness?

748
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,720
 Like I shared, I struggled.

749
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:38,720
 I, for the life of me, could not forgive for a very long time.

750
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:44,720
 So how do we move from this place of being hurt, of being wronged, to actually forgiving someone?

751
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,720
 How do we do that?

752
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,720
 What does that look like?

753
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:52,720
 What does forgiving others look like in the midst of our own suffering?

754
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:59,720
 So I don't know about you, but in my darkest and most painful conflicts and moments,

755
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,720
 the first thing off my lips are not, "Father, forgive them."

756
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:10,720
 I have other things come to mind, other words that shall not be repeated here.

757
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,720
 But here we see Jesus doing that.

758
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:22,720
 Now it's interesting when you look at the ancient records of crucifixions

759
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,720
 and what people said that were actually being crucified.

760
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:30,720
 They were calling for vengeance against those who had brought them to the cross.

761
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,720
 They were threatening the people who were executing them.

762
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:43,720
 Now that was the response of people being crucified, but not Jesus.

763
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:49,720
 And what I love about this is that Jesus practiced what he preached

764
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,720
 because he talked about forgiveness in his ministry.

765
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:59,720
 We're not able to look at all these passages where Jesus teaches about forgiveness,

766
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,720
 but he didn't just talk about it.

767
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:10,720
 He was practicing it in the darkest, most stark moment of his human life.

768
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:16,720
 And his light shined brightly in this dark moment where he says,

769
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:21,720
 "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."

770
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:29,720
 His love and mercy shines brightly, and it is love, it is mercy, it is grace

771
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:35,720
 that overcomes hurt, that overcomes evil.

772
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,720
 This is how Jesus brings victory.

773
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,720
 This is how he defeats Satan on the cross.

774
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,720
 He overcomes death, he overcomes sin, and he brings victory,

775
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,720
 but it's not through his force or use of power.

776
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:55,720
 It's through laying down his life and loving us.

777
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:05,720
 Now what's also important to say is that Jesus did not ignore that he was wronged.

778
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,720
 He didn't pretend that everything was okay.

779
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:09,720
 He didn't say, "No biggie."

780
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,720
 "Oh, it's not a big deal."

781
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,720
 He said, "Father, forgive them."

782
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,720
 They needed to be forgiven for what they had done.

783
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:24,720
 He named what they were doing as an offense needing forgiveness.

784
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,720
 A lot of times when we think about forgiving, it's like,

785
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,720
 "What, Jesus asked me to forgive that person?"

786
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,720
 Like we're like, feel like we're letting somebody off the hook.

787
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,720
 But that's not the case.

788
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,720
 We're actually saying, "What you have done, you have wronged me,

789
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,720
 but I'm choosing to forgive you."

790
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,720
 But it needs forgiveness because it's such a big deal.

791
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,720
 If it's not a big deal, we call it forbearance and we can just let it go.

792
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:56,720
 So Jesus acknowledged that what was done to him was wrong, but he does forgive.

793
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,720
 So Jesus is modeling from us from the cross how he wants us to treat one another.

794
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,720
 He wants us to be people who forgive those who hurt us.

795
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:12,720
 He wants us to reflect his character, to be Jesus' people in all of our spheres of life.

796
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,720
 Now this, of course, what he said on the cross is not the only place where Jesus,

797
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,720
 where we can learn something about forgiveness.

798
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,720
 There's too much to cover, but I want to look at one teaching from Jesus,

799
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,720
 which is in the Lord's Prayer and actually also the context around there.

800
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:34,720
 So we're in Matthew 6, starting verse 9, it says this,

801
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,720
 "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

802
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,720
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

803
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:49,720
 Give us today our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.

804
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:54,720
 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

805
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:00,720
 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

806
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,720
 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

807
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:13,720
 What? We never get to that part, right? But it's there.

808
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:21,720
 It's because Jesus wants us to be people who have received his love and his forgiveness and mercy

809
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,720
 and who can extend that to others.

810
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:30,720
 He wants us to show the same mercy that he has shown us to other people.

811
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,720
 So we see in the Lord's Prayer that unforgiveness is not an option for followers of Jesus.

812
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:41,720
 If you're a follower of Jesus, living and just remaining in unforgiveness is not an option for us.

813
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:47,720
 We're called to be people who reflect his mercy and his grace.

814
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:52,720
 We also see this in the early Jesus movement, in the early church.

815
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,720
 Paul writes in Ephesians 4, verse 30, he says this,

816
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:03,720
 "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you."

817
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,720
 So again, there's this call to be people who are forgiving,

818
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,720
 but this call is rooted in what Christ has done for us.

819
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:20,720
 It's rooted in his love, his mercy, his forgiveness towards us.

820
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,720
 So it's clear that we're called as Jesus follows, to be people who forgive.

821
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,720
 Now before we continue, I want to give a definition,

822
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,720
 actually it even goes beyond a definition about forgiveness,

823
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,720
 but I want to read this to you just to clarify what we're talking about.

824
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,720
 "Forgiveness is not to ignore a wrong.

825
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,720
 It is to make a decision to give up your right to get even with

826
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,720
 or hold in debt the person who has wronged you.

827
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:50,720
 When we forgive, we release emotional power another person has over us,

828
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,720
 and we often experience the Holy Spirit healing our emotional pain

829
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:02,720
 and releasing us to a brand new future."

830
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,720
 But why do we struggle so much to forgive?

831
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,720
 What's the reason for that?

832
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,720
 Why is that so hard?

833
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:14,720
 Why did I struggle so much to forgive this person and couldn't just do it?

834
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,720
 Well, let's look at three reasons for that.

835
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:24,720
 First, we struggle to forgive because emotional pain is so overwhelming.

836
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,720
 When somebody gets under your skin and says hurtful words to you,

837
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,720
 that's all we see, right?

838
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,720
 It's like we lose sight, we just focus on that.

839
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,720
 And that's what we hear, and that's what our brain starts processing

840
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,720
 and replaying in our minds.

841
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,720
 And so we cannot see anything else.

842
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,720
 We just focus on what this person did and how they hurt us.

843
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,720
 And so we cannot see in the middle of that that this person,

844
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:53,720
 regardless of how they're acting, is created in God's image.

845
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,720
 We cannot see that this is a person that Jesus died for,

846
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:03,720
 that Jesus loved so much that he laid his life down for them on the cross.

847
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,720
 But we cannot have this perspective.

848
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,720
 We struggle.

849
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,720
 Mary Kate Morris, someone I know, a professor, she says this,

850
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,720
 "Forgiveness is not easy to accept or extend to others

851
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,720
 because it's more than a rational act.

852
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,720
 It's an emotional act."

853
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,720
 Because what has happened to us maybe is so grievous and so painful

854
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:31,720
 that we just can't see beyond that.

855
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,720
 And we might literally not have it in our own strength to see beyond that.

856
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:40,720
 We need the Holy Spirit to do work in our hearts.

857
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,720
 So that's the first reason why we struggle to forgive.

858
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:50,720
 The second one is we struggle to forgive because we approach forgiveness

859
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,720
 from a modern-day perspective, or we could say from our cultural perspective.

860
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,720
 But what do I mean by that?

861
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:03,720
 Well, the way our culture approaches forgiveness is usually

862
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,720
 you need to say you're sorry, and you need to do this,

863
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,720
 and we might even add multiple things.

864
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:15,720
 And only then, when all these things have happened, then I might forgive you.

865
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,720
 And even if somebody says they're sorry and they apologize,

866
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,720
 we might say, "Too little, too late."

867
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:26,720
 So we also have a timing thing in that, right?

868
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,720
 Too little, too late, talk to the hand, you know.

869
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,720
 See you later.

870
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,720
 Well, that's what we could call conditional forgiveness.

871
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:42,720
 But there's a problem when we approach things in a conditional way.

872
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,720
 And you know what the problem is?

873
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,720
 Because the reality is that people usually don't ask for forgiveness.

874
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:53,720
 They usually don't say that they're sorry, and they usually don't--

875
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,720
 And so what that means is that if we're waiting and expecting that,

876
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,720
 if that's our condition to move towards forgiveness,

877
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,720
 then we're actually stuck in unforgiveness.

878
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,720
 And we're just going to live in that place with all the hurt,

879
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:15,720
 replaying those tapes, just experiencing all the pain from that.

880
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:20,720
 And we're not able to move towards forgiveness.

881
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,720
 That's not a good place to be.

882
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,720
 My three months, or however long that stretch was,

883
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,720
 were not good three months.

884
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:30,720
 I can't tell you how much my mind was replaying this,

885
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,720
 how I started physically breathing differently,

886
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,720
 maybe even shaking a bit from what happened.

887
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,720
 You don't want to live in that place, but that's conditional forgiveness.

888
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,720
 That's what our culture tells us.

889
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:47,720
 And the truth of the matter is we actually don't even define it clearly.

890
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,720
 So we don't even know what our standards are.

891
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:53,720
 We just have some standards that are there.

892
01:09:53,720 --> 01:10:02,720
 But in contrast, Jesus, he calls us to unconditional forgiveness.

893
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:07,720
 So it doesn't matter whether or not the person asks for forgiveness or not.

894
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,720
 We're just asked to forgive.

895
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,720
 We're asked to let go of the debt that this person holds,

896
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:21,720
 to let go of the right to get even.

897
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,720
 And when we practice this unconditional forgiveness,

898
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,720
 it is much more likely that a hurt that we've struggled with,

899
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,720
 that's been hanging over us,

900
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,720
 even though that's what makes it hard for us to forgive,

901
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:38,720
 but it's much more likely that we experience the Holy Spirit healing from that pain.

902
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:44,720
 It's counterintuitive, but it's the work of God.

903
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,720
 Now, I just wonder, what is your approach to forgiveness?

904
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,720
 Is it conditional?

905
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,720
 Are you practicing conditional forgiveness where people need to do the dit, dit, dit, dit, dit,

906
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:01,720
 and I don't even know what, and you're just living in unforgiveness?

907
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:07,720
 Or do you practice unconditional forgiveness like Jesus has modeled to us?

908
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,720
 Or is it a mixture? It does depend on who it is.

909
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:16,720
 I'm happy to forgive the other people, but not this person.

910
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,720
 Probably conditional, huh?

911
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,720
 So it's like the mixture in between.

912
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,720
 There are some people where we don't want to apply the love of Jesus to.

913
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,720
 Well, what is the third reason why we struggle with forgiveness?

914
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:39,720
 Well, it's because we confuse the concept of forgiveness and reconciliation.

915
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,720
 So that is the third reason.

916
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,720
 Actually, this is for me where I see the most confusion in the church.

917
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:55,720
 This is where I had confusion growing up because there is a lot of confusion around this.

918
01:11:55,720 --> 01:12:00,720
 Forgiveness does not equal a reconciled relationship.

919
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,720
 Or true forgiveness does not mean that we're reconciled.

920
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,720
 That is not true.

921
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,720
 Forgiveness and reconciliation are different things.

922
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,720
 But a lot of times in the church, you conflate it into one thing.

923
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,720
 And so people are pushed, "You need to forgive."

924
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,720
 And what they're really saying is, "You need to reconcile."

925
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,720
 But that's not true.

926
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,720
 Let me explain.

927
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:27,720
 Reconciliation takes two people.

928
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:34,720
 Now, if somebody hurts me, I can choose to forgive them.

929
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,720
 I have control over that.

930
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:41,720
 I can make that decision to let go of this offense and the hurt that's been caused against me.

931
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,720
 I cannot choose what the other person does.

932
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:51,720
 I don't have control over the other person, that they acknowledge the hurt that they have caused me,

933
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,720
 that they understand the hurt that they have caused me,

934
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,720
 and that they're going to discontinue the hurtful behavior.

935
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,720
 I don't have control over that.

936
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,720
 And so reconciliation always takes two people doing their part.

937
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:12,720
 Another way of saying this is forgiveness is a command, but reconciliation is a ministry.

938
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:17,720
 Jesus commands us to be people who forgive.

939
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:22,720
 We can do that.

940
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:28,720
 But he doesn't command us to reconcile because we don't have control over that.

941
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,720
 Because that's a ministry where we--a lot of times because we forgive, people can--

942
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,720
 because we're showing grace and mercy, maybe that's why they're able to--

943
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,720
 God's love is flowing in that, and they're able to have the courage to come forward and say,

944
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,720
 "I am sorry. I have messed up. I'm wrong."

945
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:51,720
 And show that whatever hurtful behavior we've done can end.

946
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,720
 But that's a ministry. That's different.

947
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,720
 And I actually want to illustrate that to you from the cross.

948
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:04,720
 Because Jesus--so if you read on in Luke, later on this afternoon you can read on in chapter 23,

949
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,720
 there's multiple people, multiple characters there.

950
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,720
 There is leaders, and they sneer at Jesus.

951
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:17,720
 So Jesus says, of course, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."

952
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:21,720
 So Jesus extends forgiveness to all who are involved in bringing him to this point,

953
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,720
 and of course through his death also to all of us.

954
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,720
 But that does not mean that everybody is reconciled with Jesus,

955
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,720
 just because Jesus offers this forgiveness.

956
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,720
 There is the leaders who sneer at him.

957
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,720
 There's Roman soldiers who mock him and make fun of him.

958
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,720
 There's a thief who belittles him.

959
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:50,720
 But then there's also the other thief who actually acknowledges that what he has done is wrong.

960
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,720
 And Jesus tells them these incredible words.

961
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:56,720
 He says, "Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in paradise."

962
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,720
 So that person is reconciled with Jesus.

963
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,720
 That person receives Jesus' forgiveness.

964
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,720
 But it takes the two people.

965
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:11,720
 Jesus extends the forgiveness, but he doesn't force the reconciliation on all the people there.

966
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,720
 That's something where they have to respond, and there's things that the other people are responsible for.

967
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:21,720
 So that's a very important distinction that we so often have gotten wrong,

968
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:30,720
 where we push people into relationships and circumstances where they expose themselves to continued hurt.

969
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:36,720
 Because we say you need to forgive, and really what we're thinking is you need to reconcile.

970
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,720
 But that's not how it should be.

971
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:45,720
 It actually takes the other person, especially--I mean it depends on what happens,

972
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,720
 but especially if somebody is doing harmful, hurtful behavior.

973
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:54,720
 No, they need to show that they understand the harm that they cause.

974
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,720
 You need to ask forgiveness.

975
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,720
 They need to change the way they're living.

976
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:03,720
 And then, and only then, is reconciliation possible.

977
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,720
 So like I said, and even pastors get this wrong.

978
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:13,720
 So this is a big thing, just having clarity and reconciliation and forgiveness and what it is.

979
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,720
 But because we don't have the clarity, I think we really also struggle there with forgiveness

980
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:26,720
 because we think it means to reconcile when the other person actually doesn't show any sign of caring about what they've done to us and just continues.

981
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:32,720
 Yes, we're meant to forgive, but we cannot do reconciliation without them also doing their part.

982
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,720
 So super important.

983
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:40,720
 Now that we've covered all these reasons why we struggle to practice forgiveness,

984
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,720
 I want to talk about the good news of forgiveness.

985
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:49,720
 The first thing is the good news is that Jesus has forgiven us.

986
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,720
 "Father, forgive them for they do not know what they're doing."

987
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:56,720
 Yes, that was directed to the people historically there, but through what Jesus did on the cross,

988
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,720
 he's also saying that to every single one of us.

989
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,720
 "I forgive you for all that you have done.

990
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,720
 I forgive you."

991
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:13,720
 And when we receive that, when we repent of our sins, we say, "Lord, I'm sorry," and we come to Jesus.

992
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:18,720
 We experience this reconciled relationship, and we're made whole.

993
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:25,720
 We're part of God's family, and we experience this grace and mercy just poured over our lives.

994
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:33,720
 And it is so humbling and so moving and so touching when we experience this God's goodness and love

995
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:39,720
 because his mercy is so astronomically huge towards us.

996
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:45,720
 And that's the foundation, really, even for us to practice forgiveness is because we've been forgiven,

997
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:50,720
 because we experience this astronomical love and mercy of Jesus,

998
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:54,720
 and have received the gift of the Holy Spirit.

999
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,720
 We can now turn around and be people who reflect Christ's character and relationships,

1000
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,720
 and we can be people who can work towards forgiveness.

1001
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,720
 Yes, sometimes it takes work, and the Bible is very realistic about this.

1002
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:10,720
 Otherwise, it wouldn't need to encourage us so much to be people who forgive.

1003
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:15,720
 But we can do it because God first loved us, we can love other people.

1004
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:20,720
 Because God first showed mercy to us, we can be merciful to other people.

1005
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:27,720
 We didn't deserve mercy and grace, and he wants us to do the same with other people.

1006
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,720
 So that's good news. It's God's power working in you.

1007
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:35,720
 You don't have to somehow conjure this up on your own.

1008
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,720
 So we come to Jesus to help us with that.

1009
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:45,720
 And secondly, when we forgive, God brings forgiveness and grace and healing to others.

1010
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,720
 Like a lot of times that opens the pathway. We see it on the cross.

1011
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:56,720
 Jesus speaks forgiveness, and because of that, the one thief who knew he was not a good person,

1012
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,720
 God's grace and mercy flows towards him, and he responds to that,

1013
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:06,720
 and he can receive it, and he can experience forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

1014
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:12,720
 The same is true for us. When we forgive, it makes it possible for God's grace, mercy,

1015
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:22,720
 to flow towards other people, and to lead them into repentance and into God's love and God's goodness.

1016
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:26,720
 So that is also good news.

1017
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:31,720
 And then finally, when we forgive, God begins to heal our hurt.

1018
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,720
 So we're talking about longing for healing, right?

1019
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,720
 And some of us have been carrying unforgiveness in our hearts.

1020
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:46,720
 We've been holding on to these very painful and difficult things that have happened to us.

1021
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:52,720
 And it's like a cloud that's following you around.

1022
01:19:52,720 --> 01:20:04,720
 And Jesus is inviting you to let it go, to forgive, and to experience healing from this emotional bondage

1023
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,720
 or influence that other people have had over you.

1024
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:12,720
 To just let it go.

1025
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,720
 I don't know how to pronounce this person's name. I'm going to try.

1026
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,720
 Celestron. I think it's French, so somebody can...

1027
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:25,720
 Moussé Koura, president and founder of African Leadership and Reconciliation Ministries, he says this.

1028
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:31,720
 "A troubled heart makes unforgiving people double victims."

1029
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:36,720
 Victims of both their offenders and of their own hatred.

1030
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,720
 It's like, don't do it.

1031
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,720
 Let's not be double victims. Let's not live in that space.

1032
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,720
 I know it's not easy.

1033
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,720
 I know this is very difficult.

1034
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:56,720
 And people do horrible things. They do.

1035
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:08,720
 But Jesus is wanting us to lead us out of that place and bring healing into our lives through forgiveness.

1036
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:12,720
 So if you're struggling with unforgiveness, because it's a struggle.

1037
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:21,720
 I was struggling with it. I had very long conversations with God on a regular basis over that three-month period.

1038
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:27,720
 In Luke, it says, the Gospel of Luke, 6 verse 28, it talks about how we should pray for those who ill-treat us.

1039
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,720
 When we start praying for people that have hurt us.

1040
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:37,720
 A lot of times the Holy Spirit, we give the Holy Spirit space to do something new in our heart.

1041
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:41,720
 To give us a different perspective that we do not have out of our own strength.

1042
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,720
 Where he can give us a grace and strength to let go.

1043
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,720
 Now when I prayed for the person that had hurt me, and I hurt him as well.

1044
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,720
 But when I prayed, the Holy Spirit gave me a different perspective.

1045
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:57,720
 I was not in tunnel vision, locking in on the hurtful things they had said to me.

1046
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,720
 I was able to see the bigger picture.

1047
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,720
 And part of that was that this person had experienced severe hurt in their lives.

1048
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:09,720
 And that part of them hurting me was acting out of that previous hurt.

1049
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:13,720
 Now it still doesn't excuse our behaviors when we do that.

1050
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:18,720
 But it sure makes it a lot easier to have compassion and to forgive.

1051
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,720
 And so that was something that the Holy Spirit revealed to me when I was praying.

1052
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:32,720
 And I was able to move towards forgiveness and to let go of the fence that had been, that was caused against me.

1053
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:40,720
 And when we forgive, Jesus liberates us from a painful past to a brand new future.

1054
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,720
 You know, before we're not able to move forward.

1055
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:46,720
 We're stuck. It's like walking in the same spot.

1056
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:53,720
 But when we forgive, it feels so good.

1057
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:57,720
 It really does.

1058
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,720
 And so Jesus is inviting us.

1059
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,720
 Don't be living in unforgiveness.

1060
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:10,720
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up.

1061
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,720
 Jesus has something better for us.

1062
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:16,720
 Now I do want to extend this invitation.

1063
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:25,720
 Like we saw, just because you hear about Jesus' forgiveness, doesn't mean that we're reconciled with Jesus.

1064
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:33,720
 Now if you never have responded to Jesus and you say, "You know, I'm sorry, Jesus.

1065
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:36,720
 I know the way that I'm living is wrong.

1066
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:42,720
 Now please forgive me. I want to be in a relationship with you."

1067
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:47,720
 I want to invite you just to give me a little wave.

1068
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:55,720
 You know that's not easy.

1069
01:23:55,720 --> 01:24:02,720
 And I would love to lead you in a prayer of just responding to this.

1070
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,720
 And then afterwards I have something else as well.

1071
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:10,720
 But let me--you can follow along in your heartless prayer.

1072
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,720
 So what I'll do is I'll pray and I'll pause.

1073
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,720
 And then you can repeat in your heart.

1074
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,720
 And I'll pray and I'll pause so you can follow along that way.

1075
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:28,720
 Jesus, I'm sorry for all the wrongs that I have committed against you and against others.

1076
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:33,720
 Please forgive me my sins.

1077
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:43,720
 Thank you for dying on the cross for me so that I can be in a relationship with you.

1078
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:55,720
 Lord, now please come and fill me with your Holy Spirit and make me your child.

1079
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,720
 Make me part of your family.

1080
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:04,720
 I pray all this in your name, Jesus.

1081
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:09,720
 And everyone says, "Amen."

1082
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:14,720
 So if you pray this prayer, you're like the thief who was hanging on the cross,

1083
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:19,720
 but we turn to Jesus and your relationship with God is restored.

1084
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,720
 You are reconciled.

1085
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,720
 You're a child of God.

1086
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,720
 Hallelujah.

1087
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,720
 Praise the Lord.

1088
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:34,720
 You can now be a person that forgives, that can live differently, that can love.

1089
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:41,720
 Because God loved you first.

1090
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:49,720
 But I also want to invite others of us here who've been holding on to this unforgiveness.

1091
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:53,720
 And like I said, there is no judgment in that.

1092
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,720
 It can be difficult.

1093
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:03,720
 But what I want to encourage you is just as an expression that I want to forgive.

1094
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,720
 Maybe I'm struggling or I am forgiving to stretch out your hands before you.

1095
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,720
 And I would just love to pray over you.

1096
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:11,720
 Okay?

1097
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:21,720
 So stretch out your hands before you, and I would just love to pray over you right now.

1098
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:26,720
 Jesus, you see every hand stretched out before you.

1099
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,720
 You know the hurt and the pain that has been caused.

1100
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,720
 And I know that breaks your heart.

1101
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,720
 You care.

1102
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,720
 You understand.

1103
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:41,720
 And Lord, I know it's been difficult to let go of this offense that has been caused.

1104
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:47,720
 Let go of the hurt and pain that others have brought.

1105
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:52,720
 But Holy Spirit, will you not come?

1106
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,720
 Will you pour out your grace?

1107
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,720
 Will you pour out your strength?

1108
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:04,720
 So that we have the strength so that everybody stretching out their hands has the strength to walk in forgiveness, Jesus.

1109
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,720
 In your forgiveness that you have shown us.

1110
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:12,720
 Will you give the grace and mercy to do so now?

1111
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,720
 And Lord, I pray for these clouds that have been hovering around in the hearts.

1112
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,720
 We replay these things.

1113
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:23,720
 I pray for release of this emotional power of other people have held over us.

1114
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,720
 And that there is freedom.

1115
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,720
 I pray for your freedom, Jesus.

1116
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,720
 To release your freedom.

1117
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:39,720
 So that people can, that everyone here who is praying can step forward in the brand new future you have for them.

1118
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:46,720
 And just experience your healing and joy and just move forward and not be stuck in one place.

1119
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,720
 So Jesus, we thank you for this work of forgiveness.

1120
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,720
 We thank you for the forgiveness that is flowing in this room.

1121
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,720
 We thank you that you are greater than all these things.

1122
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,720
 That you help us to walk in your love and your forgiveness.

1123
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,720
 And so we bring all these things to you.

1124
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,720
 We thank you for the new thing that you are doing now.

1125
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,720
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

1126
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:08,720
 Amen.

1127
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:10,720
 Amen.

1128
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:14,720
 I want to invite everyone to stand.

1129
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:17,720
 Let's sing like people who have been forgiven.

1130
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,720
 Amen.

1131
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:20,720
 Amen.

1132
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:21,720
 Come on.

1133
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,720
 Let's sing like people who have been forgiven.

1134
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,720
 Amen.

1135
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,720
 Amen.

1136
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:25,720
 Thank you.

1137
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:31,720
 You give life.

1138
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:36,720
 You are love.

1139
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:41,720
 You bring light to the darkness.

1140
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,720
 You give hope.

1141

 You restore every heart that is broken.

1142
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,720
 You are love.

1143
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,720
