1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Well, thank you so much for your prayers.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Yeah, I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And yeah, we're talking about healing, right?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 So, we want to pray for healing and ask for healing.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And I think it's quite interesting that I'm experiencing my own trials in the middle of talking and preaching about healing.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 But I think that gives me also – reminds me and it gives me a good insider perspective again of that as well, right?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 So, but yeah, thank you for your prayers.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Well, somebody close to me was rubbing me consistently the wrong way.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Now, I don't know if you've experienced this.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Maybe just a little bit, a tiny little bit.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 But over a period of time, it drives you crazy.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 And so, inside of myself, frustration was starting to build up.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Anyone with me on this? Yes?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Okay, thank you.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 All right, I see you.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And so, I got to the point, I was like, I have to say something.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I cannot just let this continue.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 So, in my mind, I thought objectively, of course objectively, right?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 What I was going to share, so I made a plan.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And then I stepped into the workspace and said, hey, there's something that we need to talk about.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I want to talk about this.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Let me know when it's a good time to talk about this.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So, I thought I've done my part.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So, I started walking out of the workspace.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And he says, hey, you can't do this.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 You cannot bring up a problem and walk away.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So, obviously, there's a lot of like already intensity in that response.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And let's say I reacted to that.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And words were spoken that were meant to injure, to harm.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 There was anger.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 There was hostility.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And even the threat of cutting off relationship was brought up in this conversation.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And so, everything ugly inside of me and inside the other person came out.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I mean, it was just not pretty.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I'm glad you didn't see it.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And I don't know if you've ever had this in a fight where you cross a certain line.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And you know you crossed the line.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And then in your mind you think, well, now that we're at it, let me tell you everything I always wanted to say.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Has anyone done that?

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 All right.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Yes.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Don't do it.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 It's stupid.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Nothing good comes out of it.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But that's exactly, of course, what I did.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I went for it.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 And honestly, in this conflict, I left this conflict shaking, trembling.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 I stepped out of the place.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I went for a walk.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And I was processing what had happened.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And I was feeling hurt.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I was upset.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 I was disappointed.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And I've never, up until this point in my life, had ever experienced a rupture in a relationship like I did at that point in time.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I mean, it was extreme.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And there was a lot of pain.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Now, C.S. Lewis, a well-known Christian author, he once said, "Forgiveness is lovely until you have something to forgive."

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Isn't that so true?

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 It's easy to talk about forgiveness when there's nothing to forgive, but when someone really hurts you, then suddenly it's not that easy.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Well, that's what I was experiencing in this moment.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 It was not easy.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 And I have to be honest, even things that I had learned in seminary, things that I had picked up in church about forgiveness, they were not helpful.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I just could not, for whatever reason, I really struggled to move towards forgiveness.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So it was not one of those things where 15 minutes later, you're like, "Okay, let's reconcile. I forgive you."

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I'm a harmony person. I don't like conflict.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So I want to resolve things.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But in this case, I just was not able to let go of what happened.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And I really wrestled with it.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I mean, it was so difficult.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And I just couldn't move forward.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 So what we're going to do -- oh, I should share what happened, right?

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 You're wondering.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 So after several months, this was a long period of time for me.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I was able to forgive the person who hurt me.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 I also had to own -- so it was not one of those things where I was just hurt.

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 I also did some hurting.

77
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So I actually wrote the person and also asked for their forgiveness as well, trying to do my part.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And so that's what happened there.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And today, we are going to continue to talk about our Longing for Healing message series.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And our topic is forgiveness.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Now, we have been looking at that healing is found in no other name but the name of Jesus.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 That whether we are looking for physical, emotional, spiritual healing, mental healing, it is found in Jesus.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 He's powerful, and he's able to help us when nobody else is able to help us and to bring healing into our lives.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Then last week, we looked at how a lot of times we come to Jesus for healing with a lot of shame.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And so we asked Jesus for one thing, maybe the obvious thing.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But then Jesus challenges us and calls us to actually go deeper because he wants to bring a deeper healing in our lives.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 We looked at the woman that was bleeding.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 We saw that Jesus called her to step forward.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And when she did, he restored her relationally.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 He removed her shame.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And he just powerfully, in his loving presence, brought healing into her life.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And today, the focus is on unforgiveness.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 A lot of times when you talk about forgiveness, we talk about us needing to forgive.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And if the Holy Spirit convicts you of that, please, by all means, do that.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 But I want to focus on how we forgive those who have wronged us.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Oh, that's not easy.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 But I believe that when we do that, that Jesus brings healing and relief to pain and feelings that we have been carrying around.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And he wants to just set us free from that.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 He wants to get rid of that cloud that is hanging over you.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 So that's what we're going to explore today.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Does that sound good?

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Yes.

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Yes?

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Okay.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 All right.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Just checking.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 It didn't sound that convincing, but I think that's what we need to talk about.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 So we're in a famous, one of the most famous part of the gospel.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 So I'm not going to give context.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 We're at the point where Jesus is about to be crucified.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 So I'm going to read Luke 23, starting in verse 33, says this.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 "When they came to the place called Skull, they crucified him there along with the criminals, one on his right and the other on his left.

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.'"

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Now, just think about this.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Jesus is just being nailed to the cross, and the first thing that he says is, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I mean, this is unexpected.

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Jesus had a horrible week.

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 He was betrayed by his closest friends.

119
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 He was abandoned by his closest friends.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 He was put on an unjust trial where there was an unjust ruling.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Then he was mocked.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 He was beaten.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 He had to carry his cross as far as he could.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Then he was nailed to the cross.

125
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And so here he is speaking forgiveness to all who had brought him to this place in the first place.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Now, that is sobering and profound.

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Jesus was modeling something to us that was meant to characterize us as Christians, a radical forgiveness for when we are wronged and when we are hurt.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 What a call this is to us.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 We already acknowledge that forgiveness is easy to talk about when you have nothing to forgive.

130
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 But when we actually struggle with forgiveness, when somebody actually has wronged us and hurt us, this is not easy.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 But Jesus modeled it to us, and he calls us to be a people who forgive.

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So how do we move forward in forgiveness?

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Like I shared, I struggled.

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I, for the life of me, could not forgive for a very long time.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 So how do we move from this place of being hurt, of being wronged, to actually forgiving someone?

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 How do we do that?

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 What does that look like?

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 What does forgiving others look like in the midst of our own suffering?

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 So I don't know about you, but in my darkest and most painful conflicts and moments, the first thing off my lips are not, "Father, forgive them."

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I have other things come to mind, other words that shall not be repeated here.

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But here we see Jesus doing that.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Now it's interesting when you look at the ancient records of crucifixions and what people said that were actually being crucified.

143
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 They were calling for vengeance against those who had brought them to the cross.

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 They were threatening the people who were executing them.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Now that was the response of people being crucified, but not Jesus.

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And what I love about this is that Jesus practiced what he preached, because he talked about forgiveness in his ministry.

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 We're not able to look at all these passages where Jesus teaches about forgiveness, but he didn't just talk about it.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 He was practicing it in the darkest, most stark moment of his human life.

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And his light shined brightly in this dark moment where he says, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 His love and mercy shines brightly, and it is love, it is mercy, it is grace that overcomes hurt, that overcomes evil.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 This is how Jesus brings victory.

152
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 This is how he defeats Satan on the cross.

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 He overcomes death, he overcomes sin, and he brings victory.

154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 But it's not through his force or use of power, it's through laying down his life and loving us.

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Now what's also important to say is that Jesus did not ignore that he was wronged.

156
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 He didn't pretend that everything was okay.

157
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 He didn't say, "No biggie. Oh, it's not a big deal."

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 He said, "Father, forgive them."

159
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 They needed to be forgiven for what they had done.

160
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 He named what they were doing as an offense needing forgiveness.

161
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 A lot of times when we think about forgiving, it's like, "What, Jesus asked me to forgive that person?"

162
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Like, we feel like we're letting somebody off the hook.

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 But that's not the case.

164
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 We're actually saying, "What you have done, you have wronged me, but I'm choosing to forgive you."

165
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But it needs forgiveness because it's such a big deal.

166
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 If it's not a big deal, we call it forbearance, and we can just let it go.

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 So Jesus acknowledged that what was done to him was wrong, but he does forgive.

168
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So Jesus is modeling from us from the cross how he wants us to treat one another.

169
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 He wants us to be people who forgive those who hurt us.

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 He wants us to reflect his character, to be Jesus' people in all of our spheres of life.

171
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Now, this, of course, what he said on the cross is not the only place where Jesus, where we can learn something about forgiveness.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 There's too much to cover, but I want to look at one teaching from Jesus, which is in the Lord's Prayer,

173
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 and actually also the context around there.

174
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So we're in Matthew 6, starting verse 9, it says this,

175
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

176
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.

177
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

178
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

179
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

180
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 What? We never get to that part, right? But it's there.

181
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's because Jesus wants us to be people who have received his love and his forgiveness and mercy,

182
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 and who can extend that to others.

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 He wants us to show the same mercy that he has shown us to other people.

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So we see in the Lord's Prayer that unforgiveness is not an option for followers of Jesus.

185
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 If you're a follower of Jesus, living and just remaining in unforgiveness is not an option for us.

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 We're called to be people who reflect his mercy and his grace.

187
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 We also see this in the early Jesus movement, in the early church.

188
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Paul writes in Ephesians, chapter 4, verse 30, he says this,

189
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So again, there's this call to be people who are forgiving,

191
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 but this call is rooted in what Christ has done for us.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It's rooted in his love, his mercy, his forgiveness towards us.

193
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 So it's clear that we're called as Jesus followers to be people who forgive.

194
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Now before we continue, I want to give a definition,

195
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 actually it even goes beyond a definition about forgiveness,

196
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 but I want to read this to you just to clarify what we're talking about.

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 "Forgiveness is not to ignore a wrong.

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 It is to make a decision to give up your right to get even with

199
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 or hold in debt the person who has wronged you.

200
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 When we forgive, we release emotional power another person has over us,

201
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 and we often experience the Holy Spirit healing our emotional pain

202
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 and releasing us to a brand new future."

203
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 But why do we struggle so much to forgive?

204
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 What's the reason for that? Why is that so hard?

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Why did I struggle so much to forgive this person and couldn't just do it?

206
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Well, let's look at three reasons for that.

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 First, we struggle to forgive because emotional pain is so overwhelming.

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 When somebody gets under your skin and says hurtful words to you,

209
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 that's all we see, right?

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 It's like we lose sight, we just focus on that.

211
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And that's what we hear and that's what our brain starts processing

212
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 and replaying in our minds, and so we cannot see anything else.

213
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 We just focus on what this person did and how they hurt us.

214
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 And so we cannot see in the middle of that that this person,

215
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 regardless of how they're acting, is created in God's image.

216
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 We cannot see that this is a person that Jesus died for,

217
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 that Jesus loved so much that he laid his life down for them on the cross.

218
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 But we cannot have this perspective. We struggle.

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Mary Kate Morris, someone I know, a professor, she says this,

220
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 "Forgiveness is not easy to accept or extend to others

221
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 because it's more than a rational act. It's an emotional act."

222
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Because what has happened to us maybe is so grievous and so painful

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 that we just can't see beyond that.

224
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And we might literally not have it in our own strength to see beyond that.

225
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 That's why we need the Holy Spirit to do work in our hearts.

226
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 That's the first reason why we struggle to forgive.

227
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 The second one is we struggle to forgive because we approach forgiveness

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 from a modern-day perspective, or we could say from our cultural perspective.

229
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 But what do I mean by that?

230
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Well, the way our culture approaches forgiveness is usually,

231
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 "You need to say you're sorry, and you need to do this,"

232
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 and we might even add multiple things.

233
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And only then, when all these things have happened,

234
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 then I might forgive you.

235
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And even if somebody says they're sorry and they apologize,

236
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 we might say, "Too little, too late."

237
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 So we also have a timing thing in that, right?

238
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Too little, too late, talk to the hand, you know.

239
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 See you later.

240
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Well, that's what we could call conditional forgiveness.

241
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But there's a problem when we approach things in a conditional way.

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And you know what the problem is?

243
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Because the reality is that people usually don't ask for forgiveness.

244
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 They usually don't say that they're sorry, and they usually don't--

245
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And so what that means is that if we're waiting and expecting that,

246
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 if that's our condition to move towards forgiveness,

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 we're actually stuck in unforgiveness.

248
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And we're just going to live in that place with all the hurt,

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 replaying those tapes, just experiencing all the pain from that.

250
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And we're not able to move towards forgiveness.

251
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 That's not a good place to be.

252
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 My three months, or however long that stretch was,

253
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 were not good three months.

254
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I can't tell you how much my mind was replaying this,

255
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 how I started physically breathing differently,

256
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 maybe even shaking a bit from what happened.

257
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 You don't want to live in that place, but that's conditional forgiveness.

258
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 That's what our culture tells us.

259
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And the truth of the matter is we actually don't even define it clearly.

260
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 So we don't even know what our standards are.

261
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 We just have some standards that are there.

262
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But in contrast, Jesus, he calls us to unconditional forgiveness.

263
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 So it doesn't matter whether or not the person asks for forgiveness or not.

264
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 We're just asked to forgive.

265
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 We're asked to let go of the debt that this person holds,

266
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 to let go of the right to get even.

267
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And when we practice this unconditional forgiveness,

268
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 it is much more likely that a hurt that we've struggled with,

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 that's been hanging over us,

270
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 even though that's what makes it hard for us to forgive,

271
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 but it's much more likely that we experience the Holy Spirit healing from that pain.

272
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It's counterintuitive, but it's the work of God.

273
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Now, I just wonder, what is your approach to forgiveness?

274
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Is it conditional?

275
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Are you practicing conditional forgiveness where people need to do the dit, dit, dit, dit, dit,

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 and I don't even know what, and you're just living in unforgiveness?

277
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Or do you practice unconditional forgiveness like Jesus has modeled to us?

278
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Or is it a mixture? It does depend on who it is.

279
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I'm happy to forgive the other people, but not this person.

280
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Yeah? Probably conditional, huh?

281
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 So it's like the mixture in between.

282
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 There's some people where we don't want to apply the love of Jesus to.

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Well, what is the third reason why we struggle with forgiveness?

284
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Well, it's because we confuse the concept of forgiveness and reconciliation.

285
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 So that is the third reason.

286
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Actually, this is for me where I see the most confusion in the church.

287
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 This is where I had confusion growing up because there is a lot of confusion around this.

288
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Forgiveness does not equal a reconciled relationship.

289
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Or true forgiveness does not mean that we're reconciled.

290
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 That is not true.

291
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Forgiveness and reconciliation are different things.

292
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 But a lot of times in the church, you're conflated into one thing.

293
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And so people are pushed, "You need to forgive."

294
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And what they're really saying is, "You need to reconcile."

295
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But that's not true.

296
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 Let me explain.

297
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Reconciliation takes two people.

298
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Now, if somebody hurts me, I can choose to forgive them.

299
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 I have control over that.

300
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I can make that decision to let go of this offense and the hurt that's been caused against me.

301
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But I cannot choose what the other person does.

302
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I don't have control over the other person, that they acknowledge the hurt that they have caused me,

303
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 that they understand the hurt that they have caused me,

304
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 and that they're going to discontinue the hurtful behavior.

305
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I don't have control over that.

306
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And so reconciliation always takes two people doing their part.

307
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Another way of saying this is forgiveness is a command, but reconciliation is a ministry.

308
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Jesus commands us to be people who forgive.

309
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 We can do that.

310
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 But he doesn't command us to reconcile because we don't have control over that.

311
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Because that's a ministry where we--a lot of times because we forgive, people can--

312
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 because we're showing grace and mercy, maybe that's why they're able to--

313
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 God's love is flowing in that, and they're able to have the courage to come forward and say,

314
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 "I am sorry. I have messed up. I'm wrong."

315
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And show that whatever hurtful behavior we've done can end.

316
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 But that's a ministry. That's different.

317
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And I actually want to illustrate that to you from the cross.

318
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Because Jesus--so if you read on in Luke, later on this afternoon you can read on in chapter 23,

319
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 there's multiple people, multiple characters there.

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 There is leaders, and they sneer at Jesus.

321
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 So Jesus says, of course, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."

322
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So Jesus extends forgiveness to all who are involved in bringing him to this point,

323
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 and of course through his death also to all of us.

324
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 But that does not mean that everybody is reconciled with Jesus,

325
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 just because Jesus offers this forgiveness.

326
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 There is the leaders who sneer at him.

327
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 There's Roman soldiers who mock him and make fun of him.

328
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 There's a thief who belittles him.

329
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 But then there's also the other thief who actually acknowledges that what he has done is wrong.

330
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And Jesus tells them these incredible words.

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 He says, "Truly I tell you today, you will be with me in paradise."

332
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 So that person is reconciled with Jesus.

333
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 That person receives Jesus' forgiveness.

334
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 But it takes the two people.

335
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Jesus extends the forgiveness, but he doesn't force the reconciliation on all the people there.

336
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 That's something where they have to respond, and there's things that the other people are responsible for.

337
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 So that's a very important distinction that we so often have gotten wrong,

338
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 where we push people into relationships and circumstances where they expose themselves to continued hurt.

339
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Because we say you need to forgive, and really what we're thinking is you need to reconcile.

340
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 But that's not how it should be.

341
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 It actually takes the other person, especially--I mean it depends on what happens,

342
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 but especially if somebody is doing harmful, hurtful behavior.

343
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 No, they need to show that they understand the harm that they cause.

344
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 You need to ask forgiveness.

345
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 They need to change the way they're living.

346
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And only then is reconciliation possible.

347
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 So like I said, even pastors get this wrong.

348
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 So this is a big thing, just having clarity and reconciliation and forgiveness and what it is.

349
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 But because we don't have the clarity, I think we really also struggle there with forgiveness,

350
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 because we think it means to reconcile when the other person actually doesn't show any sign of caring about what they've done to us and just continues.

351
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Yes, we're meant to forgive, but we cannot do reconciliation without them also doing their part.

352
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 So super important.

353
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Now that we've covered all these reasons why we struggle to practice forgiveness,

354
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I want to talk about the good news of forgiveness.

355
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 The first thing is the good news is that Jesus has forgiven us.

356
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 "Father, forgive them for they do not know what they're doing."

357
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Yes, that was directed to the people historically there, but through what Jesus did on the cross,

358
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 he's also saying that to every single one of us.

359
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 "I forgive you for all that you have done.

360
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I forgive you."

361
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And when we receive that, when we repent of our sins, we say, "Lord, I'm sorry," and we come to Jesus,

362
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 we experience this reconciled relationship, and we're made whole.

363
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 We're part of God's family, and we experience this grace and mercy just poured over our lives.

364
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And it is so humbling and so moving and so touching when we experience this God's goodness and love,

365
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 because his mercy is so astronomically huge towards us.

366
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And that's the foundation, really, even for us to practice forgiveness, is because we've been forgiven,

367
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 because we experience this astronomical love and mercy of Jesus,

368
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 and have received the gift of the Holy Spirit.

369
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 We can now turn around and be people who reflect Christ's character and relationships,

370
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 and we can be people who can work towards forgiveness.

371
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Yes, sometimes it takes work, and the Bible is very realistic about this.

372
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Otherwise, it wouldn't need to encourage us so much to be people who forgive.

373
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 But we can do it because God first loved us, we can love other people.

374
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Because God first showed mercy to us, we can be merciful to other people.

375
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 We didn't deserve mercy and grace, and he wants us to do the same with other people.

376
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 So that's good news. It's God's power working in you.

377
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 You don't have to somehow conjure this up on your own.

378
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So we come to Jesus to help us with that.

379
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And secondly, when we forgive, God brings forgiveness and grace and healing to others.

380
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Like a lot of times that opens the pathway. We see it on the cross.

381
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Jesus speaks forgiveness.

382
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 And because of that, the one thief who knew he was not a good person,

383
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 God's grace and mercy flows towards him.

384
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And he responds to that, and he can receive it.

385
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And he can experience forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

386
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 The same is true for us. When we forgive, it makes it possible for God's grace, mercy,

387
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 to flow towards other people.

388
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And to lead them into repentance and into God's love and God's goodness.

389
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 So that is also good news.

390
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 And then finally, when we forgive, God begins to heal our hurt.

391
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 So we're talking about longing for healing, right?

392
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And some of us have been carrying unforgiveness in our hearts.

393
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 We've been holding on to these very painful and difficult things that have happened to us.

394
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And it's like a cloud that's following you around.

395
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And Jesus is inviting you to let it go.

396
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 To forgive and to experience healing from this emotional bondage or influence

397
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 that other people have had over you.

398
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 To just let it go.

399
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 I don't know how to pronounce this person's name. I'm going to try.

400
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Celestron. I think it's French. So somebody can...

401
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Mosekura, president and founder of African Leadership and Reconciliation Ministries, he says this.

402
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 A troubled heart makes unforgiving people double victims.

403
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Victims of both their offenders and of their own hatred.

404
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It's like, don't do it.

405
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Let's not be double victims. Let's not live in that space.

406
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I know it's not easy.

407
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I know this is very difficult.

408
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 And people do horrible things. They do.

409
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 But Jesus is wanting us to lead us out of that place

410
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 and bring healing into our lives through forgiveness.

411
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 So if you're struggling with unforgiveness, because it's a struggle.

412
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 I was struggling with it. I had very long conversations with God on a regular basis

413
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 over that three-month period.

414
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 In Luke it says, the Gospel of Luke, 6 verse 28, it talks about that we should pray for those who ill-treat us.

415
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 When we start praying for people that have hurt us.

416
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 A lot of times the Holy Spirit, we give the Holy Spirit space to do something new in our heart.

417
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 To give us a different perspective that we do not have out of our own strength.

418
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Where he can give us a grace and strength to let go.

419
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Now when I prayed for the person that had hurt me, and I hurt him as well.

420
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 But when I prayed, the Holy Spirit gave me a different perspective.

421
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 I was not in tunnel vision, locking in on the hurtful things they had said to me.

422
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 I was able to see the bigger picture.

423
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And part of that was that this person had experienced severe hurt in their lives.

424
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 And that part of them hurting me was acting out of that previous hurt.

425
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Now it still doesn't excuse our behaviors when we do that.

426
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 But it sure makes it a lot easier to have compassion and to forgive.

427
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 And so that was something that the Holy Spirit revealed to me when I was praying.

428
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And I was able to move towards forgiveness and to let go of the fence that had been, that was caused against me.

429
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And when we forgive, Jesus liberates us from a painful past to a brand new future.

430
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 You know, before we're not able to move forward.

431
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 We're stuck. It's like walking in the same spot.

432
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 But when we forgive, it feels so good.

433
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 It really does.

434
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And so Jesus is inviting us.

435
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 Don't be living in unforgiveness.

436
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up.

437
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Jesus has something better for us.

438
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Now I do want to extend this invitation.

439
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Like we saw, just because you hear about Jesus' forgiveness, doesn't mean that we're reconciled with Jesus.

440
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Now if you never have responded to Jesus and you say, you know, I actually, I'm sorry, Jesus.

441
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 I know the way that I'm living is wrong.

442
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Now I want to, please forgive me.

443
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 I want to be in a relationship with you.

444
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I want to invite you just to give me a little wave.

445
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 I know that's not easy.

446
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And I would love to lead you in a prayer of just responding to this.

447
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 And then afterwards I have something else as well.

448
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 But let me, you can follow along in your heartless prayer.

449
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 So what I'll do is I'll pray and I'll pause.

450
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And then you can repeat in your heart.

451
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 And I'll pray and I'll pause so you can follow along that way.

452
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 Jesus, I'm sorry for all the wrongs that I have committed against you and against others.

453
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Please forgive me my sins.

454
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Thank you for dying on the cross for me so that I can be in a relationship with you.

455
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Lord, now please come and fill me with your Holy Spirit.

456
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 And make me your child.

457
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Make me part of your family.

458
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 I pray all this in your name, Jesus.

459
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 And everyone says, amen.

460
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 So if you pray this prayer, you're like the thief who was hanging on the cross.

461
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 But we turn to Jesus.

462
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 And your relationship with God is restored.

463
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 You are reconciled.

464
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 You're a child of God.

465
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Hallelujah.

466
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Praise the Lord.

467
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 You can now be a person that forgives.

468
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 That can live differently.

469
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 That can love.

470
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Because God loved you first.

471
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But I also want to invite others of us here who have been holding on to this unforgiveness.

472
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And like I said, there is no judgment in that.

473
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 It can be difficult.

474
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 But what I want to encourage you is just as an expression that I want to forgive.

475
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Maybe I'm struggling.

476
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 Or I am forgiving.

477
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 To stretch out your hands before you.

478
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 And I would just love to pray over you.

479
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 Okay?

480
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 So stretch out your hands before you.

481
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 And I would just love to pray over you right now.

482
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Jesus, you see every hand stretched out before you.

483
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 You know the hurt and the pain that has been caused.

484
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 And I know that breaks your heart.

485
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 You care.

486
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 You understand.

487
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 And Lord, I know it's been difficult to let go of this offense that has been caused.

488
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Let go of the hurt and pain that others have brought.

489
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 But Holy Spirit, will you not come?

490
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Will you pour out your grace?

491
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Will you pour out your strength?

492
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 So that we have the strength so that everybody stretching out their hands has the strength to walk in forgiveness, Jesus.

493
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 In your forgiveness that you have shown us.

494
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Will you give the grace and mercy to do so now?

495
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 And Lord, I pray for these clouds that have been hovering around in the hearts.

496
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 We replay these things.

497
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 I pray for release of this emotional power of other people have held over us.

498
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 And that there is freedom.

499
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 I pray for your freedom, Jesus.

500
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 To release your freedom.

501
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 So that people can -- that everyone here who is praying can step forward in the brand new future you have for them.

502
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 And just experience your healing and joy and just move forward and not be stuck in one place.

503
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 So Jesus, we thank you for this work of forgiveness.

504
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 We thank you for the forgiveness that is flowing in this room.

505
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 We thank you that you are greater than all these things.

506
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 That you help us to walk in your love and your forgiveness.

507
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And so we bring all these things to you.

508
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 We thank you for the new thing that you are doing now.

509
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

510
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Amen.

511
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Amen.

512
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 I want to invite everyone to stand.

513
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Let's sing like people who have been forgiven.

514
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 Amen.

515
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Amen.

516
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Come on.

517
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Let's sing like people who have been forgiven.

518
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Amen.

519
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Amen.

520
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Thank you.
