1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Well, we only have three weeks left in our Exodus series.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,120
 Can you believe it?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,360
 Only three more weeks to go,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,840
 and it's been an epic journey.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,960
 This is week 22 of the series,

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,120
 and if you've been with us,

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,680
 even for just a portion of the series,

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,080
 I'm sure that you felt challenged by God

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,120
 in the areas that He wants to meet you,

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,320
 grow you, stretch you, challenge you,

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,760
 the way He wants to shape and form you

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,680
 to be more like Him.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,800
 And in particular, the way that He wants to continue

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,440
 to purge out of us some of the brokenness

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,600
 that it's so easy for us to carry around with us.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,780
 And as we enter into the final three weeks of the series,

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,480
 we're really entering into what I would consider

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,840
 the core teachings of what this whole series has been about.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,920
 So if this is your first time to the Exodus series,

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
 you've just saved yourselves 22 weeks, well done.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,480
 I encourage you to go back and have a listen.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,760
 But these final three weeks are really,

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,880
 God welcomed us into the very things

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,560
 that He's been preparing you for.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,480
 And so if you've been part of this journey

26
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,140
 for whatever amount of time that may be for you,

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,600
 these three weeks, I think, are the most fundamental,

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,480
 where all the threads that God has been doing

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,200
 throughout this story are gonna be tied together.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,040
 And this week begins it

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,600
 off the back of what we saw happen last week.

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,680
 Last week, we were in chapter 32 of Exodus,

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,880
 perhaps the hardest, most brutal chapter of the whole story,

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,160
 where just off the back of this incredible experience

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,960
 with God on the mountain and God's presence with His people

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,680
 and the giving of the law

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,200
 and the very second commandment not to commit idolatry.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,200
 In chapter 32, we see Israel do that very thing,

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,560
 the very thing that God had called them not to do,

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,640
 they enter into.

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,920
 And they take the gold that they had taken

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,520
 and plundered from Egypt, and they burn the gold down

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,640
 and they fashion a golden calf,

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
 and they set the golden calf up as something to worship

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,360
 because it was tangible to them,

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,020
 where God seemed intangible, God seemed far away,

47
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,280
 God seemed this scary thing on a mountain.

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,040
 They wanted to create a golden animal

49
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,960
 so they could worship something that was more concrete

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,500
 and tangible for them.

51
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,560
 And I said last week that what we see in that story

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,160
 are three temptations that every church community faces.

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,880
 And I would say three temptations,

54
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,600
 particularly that we here at the Vine face.

55
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 And that is the temptation to finish in the flesh

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,980
 the very things that God starts in the spirit,

57
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,160
 the temptation to turn our place of worship

58
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,480
 into our object of worship,

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,840
 and the temptation to recast God

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,260
 into a version that we can handle,

61
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,520
 a version that fits, if you will, within our comfort levels.

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,120
 And all three of those temptations

63
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,180
 are idolatries in and of themselves.

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,280
 But I want you to see, and really today is a part two

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,760
 of the message from last week,

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,580
 I want you to see what these three idolatries

67
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,680
 will move every church into.

68
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,520
 All three of these have the power to strip a church

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,320
 of the very one thing that gives that church the power

70
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,440
 to change and transform the society around it,

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
 and that is the presence of God.

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,360
 You need to understand that the enemy strategies

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,480
 about the idolatries that he tempts us with in the church,

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,720
 all of them are designed to strip the church

75
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,800
 of the presence of God.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,920
 The enemy does not care about churches

77
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
 that are without the presence of God,

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
 couldn't care less about them.

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,440
 The enemy is not afraid of theological social clubs.

80
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,640
 Come on, church.

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,080
 The thing that pushes back the gates of hell

82
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
 is nothing less than the presence of God.

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,440
 And the presence of God within a church community

84
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,520
 and that presence of God within the people

85
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,600
 of that community and that presence of God

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,320
 going from them and through them and out of them

87
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,400
 and flowing into the corridors of power

88
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,520
 and the workplaces that they represent

89
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,260
 and the families that they have

90
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,760
 and God's presence operating out of that,

91
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,000
 bringing peace and love and kindness and goodness

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,800
 and gentleness and faithfulness and self-control,

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,300
 that changes a city.

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,080
 And so the reason why God is so upset

95
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,440
 about Exodus 32 and the golden calf

96
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
 is not just because it reveals

97
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,840
 what really is truly in our hearts,

98
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,620
 not just because it shows us

99
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,080
 that we've broken our covenantal relationship with God.

100
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
 The thing that really upsets him

101
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,040
 is that he knows that idolatry

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,020
 strips his presence from his people.

103
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,960
 And when his presence is stripped from his people,

104
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,240
 his people are stripped from their power

105
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,960
 'cause the power is not in us.

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,480
 Surely the power is in the spirit of God, amen.

107
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,120
 This is why Exodus 33,

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,080
 the chapter that follows Exodus 32

109
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,600
 and all this stuff about idolatry,

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,920
 Exodus 32, 33, sorry,

111
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,120
 is all about the battle for the presence of God.

112
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,280
 And if there's anything that Exodus

113
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
 and the whole story is brought us to

114
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,040
 is to the pinpoint, the crossroads, if you will,

115
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,120
 of this battle.

116
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,920
 Will we fight for the presence of God in our midst

117
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,680
 or will we choose a different path?

118
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,960
 It's a question that I think God puts before us

119
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,120
 as a church community as we draw the series to a close.

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,720
 Do we really want his presence?

121
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
 Something like really want his presence.

122
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,220
 Do we really want his presence in our hearts,

123
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,720
 in our lives, in our families, in our marriages?

124
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,200
 Like do we really want his presence with us

125
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,900
 or do we just want the benefits of his presence?

126
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,440
 I wanna show you this by unpacking Exodus 33.

127
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,120
 It's a bit more of a brighter chapter than Exodus 32

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,400
 so you can be grateful for that.

129
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,280
 But there's some challenges here

130
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,760
 that are sobering also for us.

131
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,160
 Exodus 33, verse one, look at this.

132
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Leave this place,"

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,780
 talking about Mount Sinai,

134
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,380
 "you and the people who I have brought up out of Egypt

135
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,880
 "and go up to the land that I promised on oath

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,600
 "to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,980
 "saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.

138
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,220
 "'I will send an angel before you

139
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,640
 "'and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites,

140
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,980
 "'the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites,

141
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,860
 "'the Jebusites, anyites you could ever imagine,

142
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,240
 "'I'm gonna drive them out.

143
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,960
 "'Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey,

144
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,440
 "'but I will not go with you

145
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,140
 "'because you are a stiff-necked people

146
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,760
 "'and I might destroy you on the way.'"

147
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,120
 God shows up to Moses and he says this incredible thing.

148
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,880
 He says, "Despite everything that I've just encountered

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,300
 "in Exodus 32, everything about the golden calf,

150
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,840
 "everything about your idolatry, everything about your sin,

151
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,840
 "despite all of that, I am still going to give you the land.

152
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,280
 "I'm still gonna come through with my promises for you."

153
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,840
 I mean, I want you to see the depths

154
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,640
 of the grace of God in this moment.

155
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,740
 That even Israel in their worst moment of sin

156
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,880
 and brokenness before God and in their relationship with God,

157
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,420
 God does not remove his promises from them.

158
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,100
 He says, "You will go up, leave this place

159
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,360
 "and go up to the place that I have provided for you.

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,140
 "I still have given you that land, the land of Canaan,

161
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,060
 "the promised land that he has long been calling them towards."

162
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,540
 And not only that, but he gift wraps the present.

163
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,920
 He says, "I'm gonna send an angel ahead of you

164
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,380
 "and that angel is gonna drive out

165
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,700
 "all the people that are currently living in that land.

166
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,280
 "You're not gonna have to lift a finger.

167
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,120
 "I'm gonna basically roll out the red carpet for you

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,380
 "and you're gonna move into the promised land."

169
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,380
 And you read that and you think, this is a God of grace.

170
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,740
 Because this is a God who should come

171
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,940
 and remove everything from his people.

172
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,260
 You guys have screwed up, it's all over.

173
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,740
 And some of you in the room here,

174
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
 that's how you think of God.

175
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,580
 You think if you've screwed up, it's all over

176
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,020
 when it comes to your relationship with God.

177
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,100
 You think your brokenness and your sin

178
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,220
 or the stuff that you've done means

179
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,700
 that you are on plan D with God, not plan A.

180
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,820
 And God says to his people,

181
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,100
 "You're not on some plan D here.

182
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,400
 "The exodus is still happening.

183
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,180
 "I've still drawn you out to place you in this land.

184
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,780
 "The promise has not been removed."

185
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,180
 And that should be an encouragement to some of you here.

186
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,500
 But I want you to see something really clearly.

187
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,580
 He does say this, "But I will not go with you."

188
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,380
 (laughing)

189
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,980
 He says, "I'm not gonna go with you."

190
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,460
 In other words, the cost of idolatry

191
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,860
 is not the promises of God, it's the presence of God.

192
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,260
 Oh, I'm gonna preach on this one, stay with me.

193
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,360
 Buckle yourselves in.

194
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,380
 That the cost of idolatry is not the promises of God.

195
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,140
 He's like, "The promise will still stand.

196
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,900
 "I promised that to your forefathers.

197
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,280
 "I promised that you'd ever wait.

198
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,980
 "In fact, I'm gonna send an angel forward

199
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,900
 "to do all that stuff."

200
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,220
 The cost though is that I'm not gonna go with you.

201
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,500
 'Cause if I went with you, man, I might.

202
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,220
 I might do some things I don't wanna do.

203
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,800
 So I'm not gonna go with you.

204
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,780
 You can have the promises, but you cannot have me.

205
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,080
 And in that, God is putting a challenge before Israel

206
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,580
 that I think he's also putting before us here

207
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,460
 at the Vine in 2023.

208
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,700
 He's asking them a deep, profound question

209
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,760
 that he wants them to wrestle with.

210
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,820
 He's basically saying this,

211
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,580
 what is ultimately more important to you?

212
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,660
 Having God's promises in your life

213
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,160
 or having God's presence in your life?

214
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,860
 What is ultimately more important to you?

215
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,700
 Having my promises in your life

216
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,100
 or having me in your life?

217
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,500
 Now on the surface, I know how we're all gonna respond.

218
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,340
 I want God's presence.

219
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
 It must be the presence, right?

220
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,060
 And Pastor Andrew's saying it should be the presence.

221
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,660
 I'm like, well, take the presence.

222
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,500
 I know the natural response for us is to say,

223
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,020
 presence of God, yes, we want the presence of God.

224
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,980
 But if you're anything like me,

225
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,380
 which I hope you are sometimes,

226
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,740
 if you're anything like me,

227
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,420
 you'll probably realize that if you dig a little bit more

228
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,820
 below the surface from the cheesy answer

229
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,440
 that you should give and take a fresh look

230
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,700
 at your prayer life and your worshiping life

231
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,460
 and your daily life, you might realize that your answer

232
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,300
 in your heart is a bit more complex than you might like.

233
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,700
 If you're anything like me,

234
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,180
 I think we are all susceptible to developing a relationship

235
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,080
 with God primarily for what God can do for us.

236
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,860
 That we pursue God often primarily for his benefits.

237
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,460
 Because my relationship with Jesus means

238
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,300
 that I will have a better marriage,

239
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,260
 that I'll have a better relationship with my kids,

240
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,580
 that I'll have a better work environment,

241
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,700
 that I'll be more successful,

242
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,460
 my life will generally be better.

243
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,600
 I'll be a kinder, more naturally loving, a better person.

244
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,820
 Jesus is my guru to help me to live a better life.

245
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,420
 Are you with me?

246
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,500
 Now, don't get me wrong.

247
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,020
 It is great that you want a better life

248
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,260
 and a better marriage.

249
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,440
 And God can absolutely help you to have a better marriage,

250
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,620
 to be better with your kids,

251
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,540
 to work in your workplace better,

252
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,740
 to see flourishing happen.

253
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,480
 All of those things, absolutely, God wants for you.

254
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,300
 But I want you to see the subtle danger

255
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,580
 that idolatry brings.

256
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,460
 And it is that we think that primarily our relationship

257
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,940
 with God is based on what God can do for us,

258
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,820
 the benefits of God, the promises of God,

259
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,980
 the blessings of God.

260
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,600
 And if we build a relationship with him

261
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,660
 that is primarily based on what he can do for us,

262
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,460
 our relationship, our actual relationship

263
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,140
 is going to suffer.

264
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,400
 Now, let me tell you why it's going to suffer.

265
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,700
 That if the basis or the foundation

266
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,580
 of your relationship with God is because he blesses you,

267
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,900
 he's nice to you, he helps you to be a better person.

268
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,040
 If that's why you worship him,

269
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,460
 you will ultimately struggle in your relationship with him.

270
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,300
 Why?

271
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,020
 Because a lot of the benefits we want from God

272
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,600
 are not objective ones, they're subjective ones.

273
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,420
 They're benefits that we desire, that we want.

274
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,740
 Not the benefit of salvation

275
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,240
 or the benefit of objective things

276
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
 that change us in our relationship with God.

277
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,080
 Those are amazing.

278
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,700
 But we largely follow him because we want the benefits

279
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,820
 for us personally.

280
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,900
 Now, here's the issue with that.

281
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,420
 We humans are never satisfied.

282
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,860
 And we humans get really upset at God

283
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,380
 when he doesn't give us the blessings

284
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,780
 that we thought he was gonna give us.

285
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,820
 The benefits that we thought was going to come to us.

286
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,700
 I thought I would be married by now.

287
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,300
 I thought I would have a better job by now.

288
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,940
 I thought my marriage would have been sorted out by now

289
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,540
 because I believe in Jesus.

290
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,000
 And when our benefits of him are largely subjective,

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,480
 even if those are good subjective things,

292
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,700
 and when those things don't seem to happen in our lives,

293
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
 the thing that actually breaks down

294
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,840
 is our relationship with God.

295
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,000
 'Cause if your foundation of that relationship

296
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,360
 is the benefits he brings you,

297
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,800
 and you perceive that those benefits are not coming,

298
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,520
 what's gonna be infected by that

299
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,540
 is your relationship with him.

300
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,500
 Are you with me?

301
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,680
 We will drive out the presence of God from our lives

302
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,280
 if we find our presence with God

303
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,020
 based on what he does for us.

304
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,880
 He says to Israel, "You can have the promised land,

305
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,120
 "but if your focus is the promised land,

306
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,040
 "you will lose me along the way."

307
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,120
 This is why in Exodus 32,

308
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,080
 we saw Israel enter into idolatry in the very first place.

309
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,200
 They got into idolatry like we saw last week

310
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,920
 because Moses was so long on the mountain.

311
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,840
 All those timing didn't work out for them.

312
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,200
 The benefit didn't work out for them.

313
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,720
 They weren't sure about their future.

314
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,920
 It was all about them, so they built the golden car.

315
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,720
 And when we find our relationship with God

316
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,380
 primarily about what he does for us

317
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,880
 rather than just about him,

318
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,060
 then we will find ourselves,

319
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,560
 we will find ourselves walking in his promises

320
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,100
 without his presence, and there is nothing worse than that.

321
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,600
 When you have the promises of God without his presence,

322
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,880
 you have self-help psychology that makes you feel better

323
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,720
 rather than the transformative power

324
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
 of Jesus Christ in your life

325
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,280
 that changes you eternally for good.

326
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,880
 And so this challenge comes to Israel here in chapter 33,

327
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,280
 and God is saying, "What is it that you are going to choose?"

328
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,560
 Ultimately, he's saying this.

329
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,840
 "Do you want me, or do you want the things of me?"

330
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,960
 And that is what all of Exodus has been about.

331
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,160
 It has all been about this one final question.

332
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,560
 Do you really want me, or do you just want the things of me?

333
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,740
 Because every step of the Exodus journey so far

334
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,000
 has been God taking his people out of their brokenness

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
 and bringing them into a place,

336
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,680
 not just so that they would experience his benefits,

337
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,920
 not just so that they would know the promised land,

338
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,040
 not just because of those things.

339
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,360
 God has been drawing them out so that he can draw them in.

340
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,280
 God draws them out so he can draw them in to himself.

341
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,280
 It's all been about him and his presence with them.

342
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,840
 It's all been about the power of him being amongst them.

343
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,600
 It's all been about him coming down to them

344
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,280
 and living with them and being with them

345
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,080
 and fostering a life with them.

346
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,000
 It's been about taking all of these benefits

347
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
 so that you could ultimately know who I am.

348
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
 But it's not about the benefits, the story.

349
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,920
 The story is about him with his people.

350
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,560
 Are you following me still?

351
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
 And the problem we have in the church

352
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,920
 is that we forget that story.

353
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,320
 And so often it's easy for us in the church

354
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,240
 to make our experience of God all about the benefits

355
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,240
 and we miss completely that it's ultimately about him.

356
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,760
 Whether he blesses me or he does good things for me,

357
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,200
 whether he achieves all of the subjective things

358
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,280
 that I want him to achieve in my life,

359
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,000
 he is still worth worshiping.

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,400
 That is the heart of what Exodus is all about.

361
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,820
 I think that's the heart that God calls his church to.

362
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,720
 But if you're anything like me, it's easy to struggle.

363
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,640
 This is why actually Moses writes an aside

364
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,760
 in this chapter, verse seven.

365
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,920
 He actually steps back and he shows them

366
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
 what's happened during the journey.

367
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,400
 He says, "Now Moses used to take a tent

368
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
 "and pitch it outside the camp some distance away,

369
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,960
 "calling it the tent of meeting.

370
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,640
 "And then he, in inquiring of the Lord,

371
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,240
 "would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.

372
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,820
 "And whenever Moses went out to the tent,

373
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,340
 "all the people rose and stood at the entrances of the tent

374
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,800
 "watching Moses until he entered into the tent.

375
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,900
 "So Moses went into the tent.

376
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,400
 "The pillar of cloud would come down

377
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,120
 "and stay at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses.

378
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,080
 "Whenever the people saw that the pillar of cloud

379
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,840
 "standing at the entrance to their tents,

380
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,600
 "they all stood and worshiped each

381
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,760
 "at the entrance to their tent.

382
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,020
 "The Lord would speak to Moses face to face

383
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,160
 "as a man speaks to his friend."

384
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,680
 Isn't that beautiful, the intimacy of that relationship.

385
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,700
 "Then Moses would return to the camp,

386
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,620
 "but his young aide Joshua, son of Nun,

387
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,120
 "did not leave the tent."

388
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,080
 Moses puts this in the story here in chapter 33

389
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,800
 as a bit of an aside to everything else

390
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,180
 that God is trying to say,

391
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,800
 'cause he's trying to remind his people,

392
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,760
 God has been with us.

393
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,120
 God has always been with us.

394
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,640
 Every single time we pitched that tent,

395
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
 he came and was present with us.

396
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,280
 And you all came on the outside of the tents

397
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
 and you're worshiping him.

398
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,120
 And you are now in danger of throwing all of that away

399
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,200
 simply because you're focused primarily

400
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,880
 on what he does for you rather than who he really is.

401
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 You need to understand why this is so important for God here,

402
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,640
 why this question is so critical.

403
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,480
 And to understand that,

404
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,160
 you actually have to go back a little bit further

405
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,560
 than the Exodus story itself.

406
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,400
 You have to go all the way back

407
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,320
 to the original creation of the world in Genesis.

408
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,920
 'Cause what you see in Genesis 1 and 2

409
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,960
 is this beautiful picture right at the end of it,

410
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,760
 where God creates humanity and makes humanity in his image.

411
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,560
 And what picture do we get at the end of Genesis 2?

412
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,520
 It's the picture of God coming and communing

413
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,400
 with humanity in the garden,

414
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,840
 his presence and humanity side by side.

415
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
 And there are so many benefits of Eden.

416
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,640
 There are so many things that are filled with blessings

417
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,920
 that are found in Eden.

418
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,120
 But the most important reality

419
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,800
 of what we see at the end of Genesis 2

420
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 is that God has been created to be in communion with God.

421
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,880
 It's really important that you see this

422
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,480
 right at the beginning of the biblical story,

423
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,480
 that our whole being of what it means

424
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,960
 to be made in the image of God

425
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,080
 is to be brought into the presence of God.

426
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,360
 And so at the end of Genesis 2,

427
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,240
 this is called shalom, it's called peace.

428
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,640
 In other words, this is the way things should be.

429
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,840
 We should be in this communion with God,

430
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,360
 his presence with us, our presence with him,

431
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,520
 living in such an intimacy with him.

432
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,760
 It's like God is with us as a friend.

433
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,280
 That's the way we have been created to be.

434
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,640
 And ultimately our fullness of joy,

435
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,380
 our fullness of who we are is found in the presence of God.

436
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,520
 That's Genesis 1 and 2.

437
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,760
 Are you following that?

438
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,680
 Which is why in Genesis 3, something really bad happens.

439
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,060
 See, when sin enters the picture in Genesis 3,

440
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,480
 the result of that at the end of that chapter

441
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,880
 is the exile of Adam and Eve from Eden.

442
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,580
 It is the pushing out of Adam and Eve

443
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,500
 from the presence of God in the garden.

444
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,560
 It's important that you track with this

445
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,400
 'cause we are being created

446
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,860
 to be in intimate relationship with God,

447
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,980
 but our sin banishes us into exile.

448
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,000
 It pushes us out of the presence of God.

449
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,840
 And when we're in exile,

450
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,500
 there's a longing that is inside of us.

451
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,600
 See, you have to understand that Adam and Eve

452
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,160
 are separated from God's presence because of their sin.

453
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,160
 And when that happens, it creates in all of us

454
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,880
 our greatest brokenness and our greatest longing.

455
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,320
 See, we've been created for the presence of God,

456
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
 and it is only in his presence

457
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,420
 that that brokenness is healed.

458
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,200
 So the biblical story is we're created for God's presence,

459
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,080
 but in our sin, we break the reality

460
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,200
 of that presence from us,

461
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,600
 and it creates in us this brokenness

462
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,320
 and this longing inside of us.

463
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,760
 And every human being in the world

464
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,560
 has this longing inside of them.

465
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,960
 Whether they realize where it comes from or not,

466
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
 or whether they realize how to satisfy it or not,

467
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
 that longing is in inside all of us.

468
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,040
 We don't want to be in exile from God's presence.

469
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,240
 We long as a human race to be back

470
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,760
 into a place of peace and shalom again.

471
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
 This is why Augustine,

472
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,040
 one of the greatest writers in church history,

473
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,080
 St. Augustine, he put it this way.

474
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,760
 He said, "You have made us for yourself, O Lord,

475
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
 "and our hearts are restless

476
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,120
 "until they find their rest in you."

477
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,440
 Isn't that beautiful?

478
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,020
 You've made us for yourself, but we're restless.

479
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,040
 There's this unsatisfiedness in us

480
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
 until we find that rest in you,

481
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,480
 until we find that relationship with you.

482
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,160
 Until that's rebirthed and renewed,

483
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,600
 we find ourselves in a place of great brokenness

484
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
 and restlessness.

485
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,440
 It's like I'm not fully the person that I'm supposed to be.

486
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,880
 This is why in Psalm 42, the psalmist writes,

487
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,880
 "As a deer pants for water, so my soul longs after you."

488
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,360
 What the writer is saying is not this.

489
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,000
 He's not trying to give you a picture

490
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,680
 of a nice deer in a lush meadow

491
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,600
 with an incredibly flowing stream,

492
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,560
 and the deer is lapping it up all happily.

493
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,200
 He's giving you a picture of a deer

494
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,920
 who's in a desert, in exile, in wilderness,

495
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,960
 who is so parched and so thirsty

496
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,200
 that if he doesn't find water soon, he's going to die.

497
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,160
 And he says that just as a deer would pant

498
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,120
 desperately for water,

499
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 so my soul is panting always for satisfaction.

500
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,180
 And that can only be found, the psalmist says, in you.

501
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,320
 This is why what we see happen in Exodus 33 is so key.

502
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,600
 God puts a crossroads before his people,

503
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,240
 and he says, "Do you want me,

504
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,240
 "or do you want the things of me?"

505
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,040
 Because if you decide to remain with just the things of me,

506
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,380
 you are still in exile.

507
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,080
 You're still outside of Eden.

508
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,960
 And the longing of every human soul

509
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,080
 is how do we get back to being in the presence of God?

510
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,200
 That's what Exodus has been about.

511
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,640
 The whole of the Exodus journey

512
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,240
 has not just been about what God can do

513
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,880
 to overcome slavery and oppression.

514
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,200
 It has not just been about how God wants to step in

515
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,560
 and bring evil to its knees

516
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,640
 and show his sovereignty over creation.

517
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,000
 The whole point of the Exodus story

518
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,420
 leads us to this very point.

519
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,440
 The Exodus is the story of Eden restored.

520
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
 It's the story of God stepping in and saying,

521
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,200
 "I am now coming to you.

522
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 "Even in your brokenness and sin, my presence is here."

523
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,340
 God is changing the story.

524
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,040
 And he's inviting his people to recognize

525
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,440
 that the story has changed,

526
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,000
 and they can now have the restoration

527
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,640
 of the very thing that they've longed for the most.

528
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,600
 So I want you to track with this.

529
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,160
 Is that all with you?

530
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,200
 Now when you get that background,

531
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,400
 you can understand why in Exodus chapter 32,

532
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
 God is so upset at their idolatry,

533
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
 and why in Exodus 33, he says,

534
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,060
 "The promises haven't gone, but I will not go with you."

535
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,840
 Because there has to be a choice here.

536
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,520
 You're either gonna choose me or the things of me.

537
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,340
 That's your choice.

538
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,800
 But everything I've done in this point

539
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,480
 is to bring myself to you

540
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,740
 because I have drawn you out in order to draw you in.

541
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,960
 Now notice how Moses responds to this.

542
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,380
 Verse 12, "Moses says to the Lord,

543
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,760
 "You have been telling me, lead these people,

544
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,280
 "but you have not let me know whom you will send with me."

545
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,520
 Now God's just said, "I'm gonna send an angel with you."

546
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,320
 But Moses goes, "I'm not satisfied with an angel."

547
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,960
 Anyone ever been not satisfied

548
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,880
 with who you've had to go through life with?

549
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,720
 Actually, don't answer that.

550
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,560
 That's a bad question.

551
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,400
 (congregation laughing)

552
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,260
 God's just said to Moses,

553
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,600
 "I'm gonna send an angel with you."

554
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,300
 And God says, "You asked me to lead these people,

555
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,260
 "but you haven't told me who's gonna go with me."

556
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,360
 In other words, I'm not happy with an angel.

557
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,300
 "You have said, I know you by name,

558
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,600
 "and you have found favor with me.

559
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,380
 "If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways."

560
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,820
 Another way to translate that, "Show me the way."

561
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,380
 In other words, I need you to go with me.

562
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,220
 "Show me the way.

563
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,060
 "I don't know how to do it.

564
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,280
 "I can't lead these people.

565
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,920
 "Some angel's not good enough for me.

566
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,940
 "I only want you.

567
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,300
 "You have drawn me out to draw me in.

568
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,340
 "I am in with you.

569
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,980
 "Please do not leave me," Moses is saying.

570
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,060
 I wonder if some of us can get that in our hearts.

571
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,940
 God, please don't leave us.

572
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,460
 We recognize the idolatry that's so in us,

573
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,820
 and Lord, we know that that drives you away.

574
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,980
 Lord, we don't wanna be in exile again.

575
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,620
 Notice how God replies in verse 14.

576
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,400
 The Lord replied, "My presence will go with you,

577
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,040
 "and I will give you rest."

578
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,500
 Isn't that so beautiful?

579
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,100
 Now, I want you to see something here.

580
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,860
 The idea of God giving them rest points them back to Eden,

581
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,480
 to that great place of Shalom where they had rest with God,

582
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,620
 but it also points them forward to the Promised Land,

583
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,780
 which was always promised to be a place of rest.

584
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,940
 But I want you to see something even more important.

585
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,780
 Notice the order God says here.

586
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,440
 "My presence will go with you,

587
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,300
 "and then you will know my benefits."

588
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,100
 In other words, if you seek my benefits without my presence,

589
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,500
 you will ultimately be in idolatry,

590
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,060
 'cause you're in the idolatry of self.

591
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,940
 And although those promises may not be removed,

592
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,980
 you're settling for the second best thing.

593
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,620
 But if my presence goes with you,

594
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,100
 then out of my presence will flow

595
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,540
 all of the things you will ever need.

596
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,100
 And the greatest thing you will ever need is rest.

597
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,680
 With me, your soul that longs and pants

598
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,520
 after water like a deer will find its rest in me.

599
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,500
 Notice how Moses responds.

600
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,620
 "Moses said to him, 'If your presence does not go with us,

601
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,780
 "'do not send us from here.

602
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,540
 "'For how will anyone know that you are pleased with us

603
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,020
 "'and with your people unless you go with us?

604
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,260
 "'What else distinguishes me and your people

605
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,980
 "'from all the other people on the face of the earth?'"

606
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,020
 Moses is doing amazing theology here.

607
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,300
 He's saying, "We will not go anywhere without your presence,

608
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,500
 "because if you haven't restored Eden,

609
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,860
 "if your presence isn't with us,

610
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,020
 "then what message do we have to say to the world?

611
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,940
 "We're no different from the Egyptians

612
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,260
 "if we go to the promised land without your presence,

613
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,380
 "'cause it's your presence with us

614
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,180
 "that communicates to the world

615
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,600
 "that we are welcomed back into God's presence.

616
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,820
 "It means that you're pleased with humanity again.

617
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,740
 "It means that the sin and the brokenness

618
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,460
 "is being paid for and changed.

619
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,460
 "You with us is a message for the world.

620
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,380
 "You with us says that, hey, we have a God

621
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,740
 "who despite our brokenness wants to be with us.

622
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,020
 "We have a God who wants to communicate to us as a friend.

623
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,300
 "We have a God who is worthy to be worshiped.

624
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,060
 "And if we go without you, we've got nothing to say."

625
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:24,020
 It's like Moses is saying, "I am nothing without you.

626
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,600
 "We can't do this.

627
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,840
 "There's no point in doing this.

628
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,220
 "We don't wanna be a theological social club.

629
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,600
 "We need you."

630
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,540
 And I wonder whether that might be the cry

631
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,940
 of this generation in Hong Kong

632
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,740
 and the church in Hong Kong at this time.

633
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,740
 God, we refuse to do anything unless you're with us.

634
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,680
 Because we have nothing to say to government.

635
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,580
 We have nothing to say to society.

636
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,220
 We have nothing to say to our marriages,

637
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,960
 our businesses, our families,

638
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,980
 what it means to raise children.

639
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,360
 We have nothing to say if it doesn't come through you.

640
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,100
 Your presence, out of your presence,

641
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,380
 flows all the power to transform and change everything.

642
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,820
 We can't do it on our own.

643
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,620
 There's no power in us, Moses is saying.

644
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,660
 So we will not go unless you go with us.

645
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,920
 And I wonder whether some of us in this room

646
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,780
 might get that passion fired up in us.

647
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,220
 We will not do this without you, Lord.

648
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,580
 Basically, what we're saying is

649
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,140
 we're having a holy posture before a broken world,

650
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,660
 and we're saying we are nothing

651
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,660
 without the presence of Jesus.

652
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,540
 There is nothing in this world

653
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
 that can satisfy other than him.

654
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,340
 It is him, or it is nothing.

655
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,820
 Are you with me?

656
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,420
 Well, it's easy for us to say yes.

657
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,220
 'Cause I wanna say yes to that too.

658
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,660
 But if you really put that into practice in your life,

659
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,000
 it will change everything for you.

660
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,020
 The sacrifice of the house saying,

661
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,980
 "Me and my house will serve the Lord,"

662
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,440
 is a deep, big call.

663
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,500
 Not an easy one to make,

664
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 and not one we should ever make lightly.

665
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,260
 But it comes out of this place of saying,

666
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,520
 "The presence first.

667
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,580
 "The presence first."

668
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,420
 It's amazing what the New Testament writers do.

669
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,100
 The New Testament writers pull all of this together,

670
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,340
 and they begin to make the threads of God coming

671
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,220
 and being with his people

672
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,460
 and restoring the world in Jesus Christ.

673
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,460
 You see, Exodus is just a foretaste

674
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,900
 of what's gonna happen in Jesus.

675
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,000
 Exodus is just like a foretelling of a better story.

676
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,660
 The better story, of course, is the gospel,

677
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,260
 the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

678
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,820
 This is why, in the New Testament,

679
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,900
 the writers look at Jesus,

680
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,660
 and they say, "He is Emmanuel, God with us,

681
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,540
 "the fullness of God now with us."

682
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,480
 Not God on a mountain, not God in some tent,

683
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,460
 not God even in a temple, not even God in a church,

684
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,600
 God with us fully,

685
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,560
 humanity and God together in the incarnation.

686
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,600
 Emmanuel now, God with us.

687
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,620
 This is why John, when he starts the gospel

688
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,440
 that he's writing, the story of Jesus,

689
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,600
 he says it this way.

690
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,240
 He says, "God has now had the pleasure

691
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,320
 "of taking the word and making it flesh

692
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,920
 "and having it dwell with us."

693
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,120
 The word dwell there is the word tabernacle,

694
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,620
 which links back to the passages

695
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,040
 we're looking at in Exodus.

696
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,480
 God has decided to come and tabernacle with us

697
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,960
 in his fullness.

698
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,040
 This is why, when Jesus breathes out his last on the cross,

699
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,360
 the curtain in the temple is torn, too,

700
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,180
 to allow people to come into God's presence

701
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,000
 and allow God's presence to go out to them.

702
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,600
 This is why Jesus stands in his resurrection

703
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,040
 before his disciples and says, "Don't leave Jerusalem

704
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,300
 "until you receive the helper that is to come,

705
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,940
 "that is gonna fill you and restore you

706
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,580
 "in the only way that that can happen,

707
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,900
 "the fullness of my presence with you."

708
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,060
 Which is why, in Acts chapter two,

709
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,700
 the disciples are sitting in that room

710
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,920
 celebrating Pentecost, by the way,

711
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,800
 Pentecost being the festival that celebrates

712
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,840
 the giving of the law at Mount Sinai.

713
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,720
 They're celebrating that, and the Holy Spirit

714
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,040
 is poured out on them in such a big way

715
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,920
 because the Spirit is now being written

716
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,540
 on the flesh of their hearts.

717
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,240
 This is why Paul, when he writes to the church,

718
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,660
 says, "Hey, here's the thing.

719
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,560
 "You are now the temple of the Holy Spirit

720
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,480
 "because he now lives fully in you."

721
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,240
 Our answer is not that we're drawn out of our slavery

722
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,760
 towards the mountain.

723
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,400
 We are drawn out of our slavery to Jesus,

724
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,880
 and in that, Jesus puts his fullness in us.

725
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,240
 You don't need a needon anymore.

726
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,740
 You don't need some mountain with fire and an earthquake.

727
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,960
 You don't need a tent or a temple.

728
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,180
 You don't, as much as I love it, need the church.

729
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,280
 You do, but anyway, that's a whole 'nother story.

730
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,240
 But what you do need

731
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,520
 is the fullness of his presence in you,

732
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,960
 and that is available to anyone who confesses Jesus Christ

733
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,800
 as their Lord and Savior.

734
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,040
 The Spirit is in us.

735
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,640
 The same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead

736
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,560
 is now in me.

737
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,420
 Eden restored.

738
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,260
 Are you with me?

739
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:44,480
 So he has drawn you out so that he could draw you in.

740
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,600
 He's met you in the darkest place,

741
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,520
 and his light has shone in the darkest place,

742
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,720
 and it's shone into the darkest place

743
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,920
 to welcome you out of the darkness on a journey towards him,

744
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,000
 and when you find him, to find yourself settling on him,

745
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,640
 not on his benefits, not on the things of him,

746
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,280
 but him himself.

747
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,280
 When we were in Egypt, we made a film for you,

748
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,080
 a film that could express and symbolize

749
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,560
 this incredible journey that God does in each one of us,

750
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,000
 and a film that we've created,

751
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,360
 which I hope inspires you to come home.

752
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,400
 Have a look at this.

753
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,960
 (dramatic music)

754
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,480
 (wind blowing)

755
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,240
 (dramatic music)

756
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,840
 (wind blowing)

757
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,000
 (dramatic music)

758

 (wind blowing)

759
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,040
 (dramatic music)

760
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,640
 (wind blowing)

761
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,400
 (dramatic music)

762
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,000
 (wind blowing)

763
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,160
 (dramatic music)

764
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:22,320
 (wind blowing)

765
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,880
 (dramatic music)

766
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,480
 (wind blowing)

767
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,240
 (dramatic music)

768
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:44,080
 (wind blowing)

769
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,240
 (dramatic music)

770
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,840
 (wind blowing)

771
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,000
 (dramatic music)

772
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,840
 (wind blowing)

773
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,000
 (dramatic music)

774
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,840
 (wind blowing)

775
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,000
 (dramatic music)

776
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:40,840
 (wind blowing)

777
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,000
 (dramatic music)

778
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,600
 (wind blowing)

779
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 - He's drawn you out to draw you in.

780
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,400
 May his presence be what everything in you is about.

781
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
 Let me pray for you.

782
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,400
 Father, we come before you as a people,

783
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,600
 a long, long Lord.

784
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
 To live lives that represent what the Exodus is about.

785
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,000
 Lives that are given to your presence.

786
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,600
 Lives that live out of your presence.

787
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,800
 Lives that are drawn into you

788
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,800
 and that out of you are then sent into the world.

789
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,400
 Father, I pray that your presence would be

790
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 on all of our lips.

791
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,000
 Lord, it would be the thing that we would desire the most.

792
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 The thing that would shape and form the vine

793
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
 to be the community that it is.

794
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,800
 And Lord, just like last week,

795
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,000
 we take the idolatries that we know are in us

796
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,800
 that have the power to strip us of your presence.

797
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,600
 And we thank you that in Jesus Christ, we have the answer.

798
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,400
 We have Eden restored in its fullness.

799
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,600
 That even in our brokenness, in our sin,

800
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,000
 we have one who is dead and we have one who is alive.

801
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
 And one who has taken the price of that

802
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,200
 and has opened the way for us to be fully known.

803
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,000
 And to be fully back in communion with you.

804
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,400
 And Lord, I wanna pray now.

805
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
 Maybe you'd be comfortable,

806
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,400
 you just open your hands with me as I pray this.

807
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,800
 Father, I wanna pray now

808
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,000
 for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit

809
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,200
 over every single person here.

810
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,400
 That Father, your spirit and your power and your presence

811
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,800
 be there everything, Lord.

812
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,600
 I pray Lord for those in this room

813
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,400
 that have not felt your presence for a long time

814
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,600
 would know in this moment right here

815
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,000
 the fullness of your presence, come Holy Spirit.

816
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,800
 Lord, I pray for those who feel like

817
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
 that dancer in a dark room right now.

818
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,200
 Who can see the shards of light breaking in,

819
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,000
 but don't know what to do.

820
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,400
 I pray Lord that they would feel your presence now,

821
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,600
 drawing them out of that darkness into you.

822
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,400
 Lord, for those in this room

823
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
 that are like the dancer on the desert,

824
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,800
 who have found freedom, but haven't found home yet.

825
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,800
 Father, for those of us in this room

826
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,400
 where we put your blessings

827
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,200
 and the things of you above you yourself.

828
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,200
 Would you forgive us and help us to be home?

829
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,800
 And Lord for every single one of us,

830
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,000
 I pray that we would be like her,

831
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,800
 quiet and attentive in your presence,

832
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,000
 receiving from you the fullness of life.

833
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,800
 Come Holy Spirit, come.

834
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,200
 I wanna invite you just to take a moment

835
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,800
 before we close our service, to just pray.

836
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,200
 Our most classic form of connecting with God

837
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
 is through prayer.

838
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,800
 (gentle music)

839
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,600
 So just take some time to pray for yourself

840
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
 and pray with yourself.

841
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
 Or you might even wanna pray with the people

842
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,200
 that are around you, if you feel comfortable to.

843
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,400
 Maybe pray with your spouse or pray with your friends.

844
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,200
 Just take some time just to acknowledge God's presence.

845
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
 Confess the desire that you have

846
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
 for his presence in your life.

847
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
 And invite more of that presence.

848
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 And we'll do that in a place of worship.

849
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,580
 (upbeat music)
