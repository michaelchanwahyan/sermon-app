[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.280]   Everyone says?
[00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.280]   Amen.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.440]   Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.440]   So good.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.440]   Have a seat.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.800]   I want to say particularly a warm welcome to everybody at the two o'clock service.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.440]   It's great to have you here together.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.400]   I'm sorry that I'm not with you in person today.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.600]   I'm currently on a plane flying to Singapore where I'm going to be teaching at a conference
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   there all week.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.480]   So I couldn't actually physically be with you.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.040]   But you're tuning into this and we're so glad that you're with us.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.880]   And I pray that even though you're watching this on a screen right now, that God will
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.360]   speak to you and that you'll hear the Holy Spirit challenging you in the areas that he
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360]   has for you today.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.760]   So it's great that you're with us.
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.080]   And welcome to everybody who's here for the first time.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.600]   If you've never been to the Vine before, my name's Andrew.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   I'm one of the pastors.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600]   And it's grateful.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600]   We're so grateful.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.640]   Even on a rainy day, a rainy day.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.200]   I am flying off to Singapore this afternoon.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.200]   It's so funny.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.880]   I like checked the weather because I'm like, I need to get away from this crazy rain.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.240]   Like I'm so tired of it.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.240]   I want to go somewhere.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.520]   I'm going to see some sun.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.280]   And I looked at the weather, the place that I'm going to be doing this conference in,
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.200]   and it's raining there.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.560]   So praise the Lord Jesus.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.600]   So we continue our series in Ephesus today, in Ephesians, the book.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.920]   And we come to a passage that is very, very important to us as a church, very important
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.040]   to me as your pastor here.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.520]   We come to what really is the central passage to, I think, Paul's whole book.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.660]   It's pretty much in the center of his book.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.680]   But it's also the central passage to us and our vision here at the Vine.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.920]   And if you've been coming to the Vine, and there's people in this room that have been
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.480]   coming to the Vine for 10, 20, 20 plus years, my prayer today is that you'll hear something
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.960]   fresh out of the passage that perhaps you've heard us teach on a few times before.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.280]   But if you're relatively new here at the Vine, and to be honest with you, we've just done
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.160]   a survey in the last month or so to ask about who you are.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.440]   And we know that many of you here have only been a part of this church for, say, one year,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.200]   two years, or even less than that.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.960]   So we know that there's a lot of relatively new people.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.040]   You may not have heard us speak about what is the central sort of heartbeat of our vision,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.080]   why we do what we do as a church, and more than that, what our heart is for you.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.680]   If you align to the Vine Church, and if you say that the Vine Church is your home church,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.560]   then everything I'm going to speak about over the next 30 minutes is specifically about
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560]   you.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.040]   It's about you, it's about your life, it's about what the Holy Spirit wants for you,
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.400]   because if this is your home church, what I'm sharing is the heart of everything that
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.080]   we do here as a church.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.680]   And the catalyst to this heart started back in around about March of 2013.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.680]   It was about nine months or so before I took over here as senior pastor in November of
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.680]   2013.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   And in March 2013, I was praying, and if I'm honest with you, I was feeling very overwhelmed,
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.320]   I was feeling very nervous, I had imposter syndrome.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.680]   We had two phenomenal founding pastors here at the Vine, John and Tony, that had done
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.800]   such an incredible job of birthing and growing a church.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.760]   And I was feeling, if I'm honest, the weight of picking up at a relatively young age at
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.440]   the time, I was relatively younger at the time, picking up a large church and trying
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.520]   to lead it off the back of two gentlemen that had led it so beautifully and so wonderfully.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.560]   So in all of those insecurities and that kind of sense of pressure, I went to God and I
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.960]   was just praying, I was like, "God, look, I just want to understand your heart for these
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.080]   people in the season that's ahead.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.400]   Because if I can understand your heart for them, then I think I can kind of get over
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.800]   myself and my inadequacies that I'm sensing and lean into what your heart is for these
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   people."
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.120]   And as I was praying that, I heard God speak and He spoke, perhaps what I would say is
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.440]   the clearest He's ever spoken to me.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.160]   It would probably be a lie to tell you that I've heard the audible voice of God.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.560]   I don't know what the audible voice of God is.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.680]   But this was probably one of the times in my life where I've heard Him speak into my
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.200]   soul.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.000]   His word just kind of hit me deeply in who I am.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Here's what He said, it was very simple.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.680]   He said, "Andrew, I don't want you to grow a big church, I want you to grow big people."
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.440]   And that shift changed everything for me.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.000]   Because I was so anxious about taking on a large institution, a large church, and having
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.100]   to maybe grow that church even bigger.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.040]   And God shifted it and He said, "Andrew, forget about the size of things, forget about the
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.840]   institution of it.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.520]   What I want you to focus on is every single individual and my desire for them to grow
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.600]   in their relationship with me.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.760]   I want you not to grow a big church, not that there's anything wrong with large churches."
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.880]   Again, the Vine over our three services is a relatively large church.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.200]   But I don't want you to focus on trying to grow an institution, I want you to grow people.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.280]   And I have to tell you, that resonated so deeply in me because I sense that that's my
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.840]   passion.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.120]   That's everything that I want.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.160]   I want you, and you've heard us say this at the Vine, if you've been coming for any period
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.680]   of time, you've probably heard this before.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.200]   Whether you're here for two weeks, for two months, for two years, for two decades, I
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.360]   want you to grow in Christ Jesus.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.840]   I want you to get to the end of a week and feel like because of your connection to the
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.240]   people in this room, because you feel like you're a part of a gathered community in Hong
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.960]   Kong, that you feel like you know Jesus more, you're deeper in connection with Him, you're
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.040]   walking more faithfully, you have a boldness to share the gospel like you've never had
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.560]   before, you have a mindset to understand justice and the vulnerable and the marginalized and
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.600]   wanting to make a difference, that you're looking at your workplace and the sphere of
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.000]   influence that Christ has planted you in, and you're saying, "How can I use the gifts
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.120]   and the talents and the spiritual things that God has given me to work out in the very place
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   that I am?"
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.680]   Because you've heard this before, church is not 90 minutes on a Sunday, church is the
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.800]   gathered group of people wherever that might happen.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.300]   That happens in the workplace.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.320]   It happens in schools and universities.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.460]   It happens with entrepreneurs.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.640]   It happens in families.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.960]   It happens in any place that someone who professes the name of Jesus is rooted and present, Jesus
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.600]   is there and they can bring heaven to earth in that place.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.740]   And if there's anything that drives the heartbeat of the vine, it is that.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.920]   We love gathering together in these 90 minutes on a Sunday, but this is not the fullness
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.940]   of what church is about.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.000]   Church actually comes more alive when you wake up on a Monday and you get dressed and
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   you go into your workplace and you spend the majority of your time with people who don't
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.640]   know Jesus.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.240]   I envy you.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.960]   I spend most of my time with Christians.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.080]   And I have to tell you, no, I won't go there.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.480]   You get to spend most of your time with people who don't believe, and what a beautiful, wonderful
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.480]   thing that is.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.920]   So our vision here at the Vine is simply this, growing big people.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.700]   Three words, that's it.
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.880]   Very easy for everybody to remember, growing big people.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.200]   That's our desire, is that you would mature in your faith and that you would be so infused
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.640]   with the gospel, with understanding what that means through the life, death and resurrection
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.680]   of Jesus, through the birthing of the church and through the wonder of what it is to live
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.920]   reconciled with him, but also then to be in the ministry of reconciliation for others
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.640]   in the world that you're longing to grow and mature and deepen that relationship more and
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.080]   more as you go through life.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.760]   For me, that's what this is all about.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.640]   And I want you to hear this, we honestly believe here at the Vine that the local church is
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.000]   the hope of the world, the local church.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.880]   And again, by that, I don't mean a building or an institution or an organization.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.520]   I don't even mean services.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.760]   I mean you and me.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.320]   I mean our relationships.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.760]   I mean community.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.400]   I mean the gathered group of God's people together.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.560]   That is the hope of the world.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.560]   It's the hope of the world because God has always chosen in redemptive history, right
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.880]   from the beginning of all things, from Genesis chapter four and then the calling of Abraham
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.640]   and the formation of Israel from Genesis chapter 12.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.840]   What it's all been about is that God has said, "I'm going to reveal my character, my nature,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.120]   my truth, my heart, my love through my gathered people."
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.040]   I mean that's what Israel was all about in the Old Testament.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.960]   And that's why God gathers them at Mount Sinai and pours out his heart to them in the law
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.240]   because he wants them to be this physical representation of his character.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.040]   That's what the gathered church is about.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.400]   It's why Jesus told them to stay in the upper room until he pours out his spirit so that
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.080]   they could be filled with that law that is no longer on a tablet of stone, but is now
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.380]   written on the softness of their hearts by the spirit of Christ, the same spirit that
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.600]   raised Jesus from the dead, now given to them the birthing of the church so that they could
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.580]   then go out and represent the character and the heart and the passion and the saving grace
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.800]   of Christ Jesus to the world.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.720]   That's what it's always been about.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.480]   So if you want to know what the answer is to some of the greatest challenges that we're
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:14.360]   seeing in the world today, it is you and it is me, it is us, the church, the people of
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.200]   Christ.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.360]   And see this is really important.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.180]   The reason why our vision of growing big people is really important is because 91% of people
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.560]   in Hong Kong do not know Jesus.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.560]   You know that?
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.640]   That's the latest statistic.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:36.320]   91% of people in our city do not know Jesus, which means we have an awesome responsibility
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.240]   and an incredibly exciting...
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.280]   What other city would you want to live in than that?
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.000]   A city that desperately needs the very thing that sits in your heart, the very thing that
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.120]   has captured your life, the very thing that has transformed you and saved you and set
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.760]   you free, the very thing that wakes you up in the morning with your heart beating faster
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.840]   to say, "I'm so grateful that I know Christ."
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.440]   91% of the people in our city do not have that experience, but they could through the
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:13.720]   church, not by trying to get everybody in here, but by trying to release all of us out
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   there.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.400]   That's the river model vision here at The Vine.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.120]   That's why we're growing big people, but we have this idea of the river model where all
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.320]   of us has a spirit influence that we're rooted in, where we get to live out the beauty and
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.820]   the wonder of the things that we talk about here on a Sunday.
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.920]   And that's important because what Christ wants for His church is that it would be His hands
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.500]   and feet in every aspect of society, in every part.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:44.800]   And in this room right now and over our three services, even in the two o'clock, you represent
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.980]   the beauty and the wonder of some aspect of Hong Kong society.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.600]   And what a powerful thing it is to think that the church is in the law firms, that the church
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.840]   is in the governments, in the corridors of power, that the church is in the police force,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.560]   that the church is in our universities and education institutions, that the church is
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.720]   almost everywhere in our society, hopefully bringing the love of Christ to that place.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.720]   See, the reason why this is important as well, the reason why we want to grow big people
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.920]   here is because a mature church is not easily shaken.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.800]   And I tell you what, the world is shaking right now.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.400]   With all of the economic challenges and the political challenges around the world, the
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.240]   world is more in war today than it has been five years ago, ten years ago.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.600]   The world is more at war, not just physically and violently as we see around in various
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.080]   different conflicts, but at war culturally with each other.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.080]   It's never been more like that than ever right now.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.400]   And in the midst of that, wouldn't it be amazing if there was a presence of a group of people
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.880]   who, despite the fact that everything else was shaking and everything else seems scary
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.760]   and overwhelming, there was a group of people who were rooted in something, grounded in
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.600]   something that was so sure and so strong to them, that despite the fact that they may
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:12:00.000]   also feel a bit of fear at times, that they may also sense that there is this change that's
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   happening.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.440]   They could say, "There is a rootedness that we can have, and I am not afraid because my
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.200]   hope is not here.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   My hope is in Christ.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.720]   And because my hope is in Christ, I have salvation.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.360]   I have a solid rock on which I'm building my life, and everything else can shake, but
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   there is hope."
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.440]   I tell you, when you're living in a culture and a society and a city that is shaking like
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.800]   Hong Kong's is, people are looking for those who are secure.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.040]   And they're thinking maybe that security is found in money.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.680]   And when the economy shakes, everybody gets overwhelmed and fearful.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.760]   Or maybe that security is found in some relationship.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.520]   If I could just get married or date somebody or find the hot girl that I've been looking
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.040]   for or the stable guy that I want, we think that's where our security will come.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.680]   And the church has the opportunity to stand up in the midst of all of those conversations
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.680]   and say that there's only one place where true security comes, and that's outside of
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.840]   yourself in the one who's the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.400]   Which is why, when we're growing big people here at the Vine, we're doing it because a
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.480]   mature church can offer an alternative vision of life.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.360]   I tell you what, in the conversations that I have, I know I just told you that I spend
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.800]   most of my time with Christians, which I do.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.200]   But in the conversations I have with my non-Christian friends and the non-Christian community that
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   I have, I constantly hear this communication.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.120]   It's basically, "I wonder if there's another way to live because the system is not working
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.120]   for us right now."
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.720]   I tell you what, post-modernism has failed this world.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.320]   It had this great hope when it started, but it's failed people, and they've realized that.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.960]   Modernism, materialism failed us.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:39.520]   Actually the extreme polarizations of elements of culture, extreme liberalism is failing.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.840]   Extreme conservatism, the right-wing side of things, which has led to, in history, some
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.640]   really bad things, is failing.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.400]   And so in the midst of that, people are looking for an alternative way of life.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.880]   They are wanting, literally, to be awoken to the reality that there is another way to
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.200]   live that can bring hope and life and charity and kindness and goodness and actually see
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.960]   the world come together more than to be driven apart like it seems at the moment.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.280]   And people are looking for where that alternative life is.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.680]   And if the church remains silent, people are going to look over our heads to something
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.240]   else.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.000]   And as we begin to speak up and as we begin to mature, as we begin to grow in our relationship
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.280]   with Christ, we begin to hold forth and hold fast the Word of God in the world.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.080]   We begin to say, "This is a new way to live.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.240]   This is a way that you can know peace where, even though the world might be going crazy,
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:39.160]   there's a solidness to shalom, to peace, to reconciliation that you can know right here
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   and right now."
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.280]   Could you imagine Hong Kong as a city who, in this shaking time, would look out to a
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:51.160]   church that was so rooted in its maturity in Christ that people were like, "I want to
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.400]   be a part of that."
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.400]   That's our vision.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.660]   I mean, that's really what Growing Big People is all about.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.840]   I think God is looking for that kind of church.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.160]   And I'm not saying that the Vine is that kind of church.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.600]   I'm saying that's the cool, that's the goal, that's the challenge that Christ has placed
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.560]   upon us as a community here.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.520]   I think this is essentially the kind of church that God is looking for.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.600]   Let me read this to you.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.160]   Filled with people who are confident in what they believe, mature in their experience of
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   the kingdom and the works of God, literate in their understanding of His Word and its
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.400]   narrative, experienced in their healing and their restoration, skilled in their advocacy
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.480]   for justice, and planted with hope in the brokenness of the world.
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.720]   That's a church I want to be a part of.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.360]   And again, by church, don't think Vine, institution.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:50.480]   Think a group of people who believe this and have dedicated sacrificially their life to
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.960]   living out this.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.360]   I think that's what Christ died for.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.840]   I think Christ did not die for an immature church.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.020]   Christ died for this kind of community.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.640]   And my heart, our heart as a leadership here at the Vine, if you call the Vine your home
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.200]   community, this is what we're hoping to go towards.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.860]   This is the goal that we're trying to attain to.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.040]   This is what we're trying to move together in.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:21.480]   And as we mature individually, we mature communally.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:28.000]   And I believe we take steps towards becoming a church like this that could truly, truly
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.920]   change that statistic from 91% who don't know Jesus to whatever percent, hopefully, we can
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.760]   get it to where they do.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.960]   Is anyone else excited about that?
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]   No.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   Okay.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.160]   That's great.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:50.600]   Now what I want to do is I want to show you how Paul, I think, places so much of what
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.960]   I've been talking about with you so far into this passage we're looking at today.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.480]   As we continue our series in Ephesians, we come to Ephesians 4, verses 11 to 16.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.800]   And this is Paul's growing big people moment.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.400]   This is him explaining to his church in Ephesus his heart for them to mature and to grow.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:15.080]   And not only does he explain the idea of it, he actually maps out a process in these verses
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.000]   by which his church could mature more.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.880]   And I love this because what I'm going to do is, after I read it, is I'm going to break
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   that down for you.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.040]   I'm actually going to show you the process that Paul provides for his church because
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.720]   what Paul is trying to do in Ephesus, we're trying to do here at the Vine.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.280]   It is to grow a church of mature believers for a purpose of trying to change the world.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.360]   And that was definitely Paul's heart as a pastor.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.520]   It's our heart here.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.360]   So let me read this to you from Ephesians 4, starting in verse 11.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:48.020]   It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, some
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:53.420]   to be pastors, and some to be teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service,
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:18:00.100]   so that the body of Christ may be built up in unity, built up until we reach unity in
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.020]   the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, and we become mature, attaining to
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.900]   the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.220]   Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.980]   there by every wind of teaching and by the cunningness and craftiness of people in their
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.380]   deceitful scheming.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.740]   No, instead, speaking the truth in love.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.100]   We will in all things grow up into Him who is the head, that is, Christ.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.540]   From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:37.500]   itself up in love as each part does its work.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.300]   Paul has such a passion for his church in this moment because he wants them to see something
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   that I think he felt they were failing to see up until this point.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.340]   He's just spent three chapters talking about what Christ has done in His grace in their
[00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.540]   lives, and we've unpacked that in this series so far.
[00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:57.960]   But here in chapter four, he starts by saying, "I want you to live a life that is worthy
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.300]   of the calling you've received."
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.220]   And Susanna beautifully unpacked that for us last week as she challenged us to understand
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.140]   how we can walk in kindness and humility and goodness towards one another.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.540]   Now Paul's going to take this idea of what it is to live a life worthy of the calling
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:18.340]   you've received and show you how that works in the church, how there is this process of
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:24.060]   living a life that's truly worthy of that calling through maturity in Him.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.860]   And so I want to map this out for you.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.900]   The first thing he does is he says, "Look, there's three things that are central to the
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.540]   idea of maturing in a church.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.420]   Any church that is going to seek to mature people, you need to understand that God has
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.820]   created three specific elements that work for that.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.260]   The first he talks about, which we've come in the modern church to call the five-fold
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.340]   ministry gifts.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:53.300]   He just speaks about five types of giftings that have been placed in the church to help
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.300]   that church to grow.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:20:00.320]   He says apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.300]   These are not professional employees.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.520]   These are people within the church themselves that are walking and ministering and living
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.980]   in certain gifts that are for the maturity of the church itself.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.900]   Now we don't have time today to unpack what those five different things are and the different
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.100]   nuances of each of them.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:24.260]   It suffice to say that God has taken care of the community of His church by gifting
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:29.420]   it with such a way that there is diversity, there is different ideas of those gifts, they
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:35.300]   bring different things to the table, but seen together in their totality, they're designed
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.180]   to help the church to grow.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.540]   They're designed to help the church to mature and to deepen in their faith.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.660]   And so every church should be thinking, how do we have these five things at work amongst
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.660]   us?
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.580]   Again, they're not offices or they're not like titles.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.460]   These are gifts that are at work amongst us so that we might be able to do something.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.380]   And I'll explain what that do something is in a moment.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.860]   But notice how Paul writes it.
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:05.980]   He says, "God has given some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be…"
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.180]   He doesn't say God is called.
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.940]   He doesn't say God is made.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.860]   He says God has given these gifts.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.260]   So the focus is not on the person.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.260]   Look at me.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.660]   The focus is on God gifting.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:25.020]   In other words, it is a movement of His grace into a church community so that church community
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.020]   can grow.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:32.740]   And because it's a gift, it's given in order to achieve and accomplish something.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.620]   And I'm going to explain about that in just a moment.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.260]   So the first element is there is these gifts that God has placed amongst us.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.380]   The second element comes out in verse 15.
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.420]   He says, "Now speaking the truth in love."
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.160]   So Paul says not only is it important to have these five common gifts at work in your body
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.620]   to make it mature, you also need to be speaking the truth in love.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.620]   I love this.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.220]   Paul's saying a mature church is a church that doesn't shy away from the absolute truth
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:06.020]   of God, the absolute truth of Scripture, the absolute truth of the gospel and the life,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.380]   death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:14.540]   As a church embeds itself in the truth and shares that truth, speaks that truth, encourages
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:18.180]   that truth amongst them, it then grows and it matures.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.940]   I love this.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:20.940]   Speaking the truth.
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.020]   Now this is really important because I think in the world today, particularly in our postmodern
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.020]   context, there's been an attack on the idea of absolute truth.
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.620]   And instead it's all about subjective truth or relative truth.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.180]   And whatever that subjective truth or relative truth is for you, you should embrace that.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.260]   But it will be different for the subjective or relative truth for someone else.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.340]   And you can't judge anybody else's subjective truth.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.720]   And so what we've got now is a culture, even in our time right now, where you'll hear this
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.940]   phrase a lot, "Own your truth."
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.340]   Just own your truth.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.260]   It's good for you to own your truth, which basically means you can believe whatever you
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.260]   want.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.460]   I'm going to believe whatever I want and never the two shall meet.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.780]   And I tell you what, us Christians, we've embraced this.
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.220]   I'm being honest.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.860]   We've embraced this.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.500]   This is how I think we so often are when we're around those that don't know Jesus.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.780]   We're like, "Well, I've got my faith and I want to respect their space.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.260]   And I have my faith.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.500]   I have my truth.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.500]   They have their truth.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.900]   And we're just going to like that."
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.220]   I want you to know something really clearly.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.780]   You don't have my truth.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.980]   You have the truth.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.160]   Come on, church.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.640]   You don't have just, "This is my truth and that's something else over there."
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.540]   You have the absolute truth.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.040]   The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus is an absolute truth.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:44.640]   And Paul's saying the church matures when it doesn't shy away from the reality that
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.440]   there is an absolute truth.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.560]   That there is something that the world revolves around.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.200]   That there is a creator who's created this world and poured his heart and life into it
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.720]   and wants to have relationship with the people that he's created.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:01.160]   When a church embraces and is willing to speak up for the absolute truth of Scripture, Paul
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.760]   says the church grows.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.000]   It matures.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.600]   The people there mature.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.040]   And it's a wonderful thing.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   Notice this though.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.000]   He qualifies it by saying, "In love."
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.560]   Which is another problem because the church over history hasn't done that.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.720]   They've taught the absolute truth, but sometimes not in love.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   From a posture of judgment.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.520]   From a posture of finger pointing.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.160]   From a posture of, "You're not as good as us and you need to get better, so hear this
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   truth."
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:35.480]   Paul says, "No, we don't shy away from the absolute truth that we're rooted in as Christians,
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:41.880]   but we do it, we share it, we speak it in love with one another and with those out there."
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   It's done from a place of love.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.080]   And remember, he's just prayed a prayer to them at the end of chapter three where his
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.800]   pastoral prayer was all about, "I want you to be changed inside through your knowledge
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.800]   of the love of God.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.880]   I want you to know the height and the depth and the width and the length of that love.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.480]   And I want that love to so transform you that it will surpass your understanding and it
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.400]   will fill you with the fullness of God."
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.320]   He's just prayed passionately that they would know love.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.480]   Then he says, "Now speak the truth out of the overflow of the love that's in you."
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.560]   When you share the absolute truth of the gospel with someone from a place of love, you share
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   it not from a idea of, "I need to judge this person because their behavior is bad."
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.760]   You share it from, "Man, I so long for this person to flourish and grow and be just like
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.760]   me, transformed."
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:29.480]   Because could you imagine the lawyer they could be if they actually believed in Christ?
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.280]   You're looking at it from a completely different perspective because you want the person to
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.440]   grow and flourish and be the best that they can be.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.600]   And your heart's somewhat broken that they're not living in the way that God has created
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   them to be.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   But you're not judging them.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.000]   You're sharing the truth in a place of love.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.560]   Paul says, "When that happens, you have a mature church.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:51.400]   An immature church shies away from absolute truth."
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.680]   And I know that's not a popular thing to say, so I'm going to say it again.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.300]   An immature church shies away from absolute truth.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:05.760]   But a mature church is willing to stand on the truth of Scripture, but do so in love.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.320]   The third thing he says is he says, "You've got to understand that Christ is the head
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.020]   of the church and we are his body."
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.360]   So he shares about there's an authority structure in the church.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.720]   Not an authority structure that's human made, an authority structure that comes with Christ
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720]   as the head.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.800]   But the authority is in him.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.360]   He said this at the beginning in Ephesians chapter 1.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:28.680]   He said, "The will of God is that all things on heaven and earth would come under one person,
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   that is Christ."
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.160]   So Christ is the ultimate authority, he says, but he gets, "We are his body."
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.160]   We get to be his body.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.760]   And this is a beautiful thing because as the body of Christ, we get to be different parts.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.400]   Our differences are a good thing.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.120]   Our backgrounds and our talents and our gifts that are different from one another, they're
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.200]   all good things.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.000]   As we bring them together in this one body, we build each other up.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   We grow in Christ.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.080]   We mature, he's basically saying.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.960]   And so this idea of being a body means not all of us are the head, not all of us are
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.600]   the hand, not all of us are the feet.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.680]   Some of us are this, some of us are that.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.120]   Some of us are even the spleen.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.960]   Nobody wants to be the spleen, but some of us in this room, you're the spleen.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.040]   That's the metaphor he uses in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.360]   We're all different parts of the body, but together we make up this wonderful thing.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.880]   So Paul is saying a maturing church happens because there are servants that are there
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:24.440]   to serve, there's revelation that is heard amongst us, and there is a community in which
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.120]   is developing in that space.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.680]   So servant-hearted leadership, revelation of God's truth, and a community of people
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.000]   working together is part of the journey of maturing the church.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.480]   And Paul's saying if those three things are not at work, you will fail to see a maturing
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   church.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.080]   And if those three things are not at work in your life, you will probably fail to mature
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.720]   yourself in the way that Christ would want you to mature.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.840]   Those three things are non-negotiables.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   Helping so far?
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   Yes.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   Thanks, Ellison.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.480]   Actually, I just heard everybody at the two say yes.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   Thanks, two.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480]   I appreciate you.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.480]   All right.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.880]   Now, look what happens next.
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.040]   So he's just said, look, there's three elements.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.280]   He said these three elements work towards one goal.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.280]   Notice this.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.760]   He says, "So that they would prepare God's people for works of service."
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.600]   Ah, I love that.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.320]   Notice he doesn't say, "So that they would prepare God's people to come to church on
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   Sunday."
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.000]   He doesn't say that they'll prepare God's people to feel better about themselves.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.400]   He says, "These things prepare God's people for what he describes works of service."
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:35.080]   So Paul's vision for a maturing church is not a church that's passive, a church that's
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.920]   active.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:40.880]   His vision for people that are a part of a church is not that they would come in and
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:46.640]   only receive, but that they would be actively doing and giving and working out there somewhere
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.200]   in the world.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.280]   His vision for a church that's maturing is not a church that's filled with people who
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:58.240]   are just here to consume, but a church that's filled with people that are dying to contribute.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.040]   Because all of these things, this idea of servant leadership, revelation, and community,
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.360]   they're all working towards preparing God's people for the works that God has for them
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.680]   to do.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.240]   The three things on this side are the things that we should be supplying to you here at
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.320]   the Vine as your leadership, and how you should be supplying to one another, but it's to prepare
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.720]   you to go and do something.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.680]   I think one way of thinking about it is this, the servants in the church are to prepare
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:30.080]   the church so that the church could be the servants to the world.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.040]   Come on church, do you follow that?
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.800]   So the servant leadership within the church is to prepare the church to be the servant
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.740]   leaders of the world.
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.800]   So you could be in your marketplace situation, in the law firm, in the school, in the university,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.880]   wherever it is, the family, whatever, and you're there going, "How do I do this for
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   the people around me?
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.960]   How do I serve?
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.280]   How do I share the gospel?
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.420]   How do I live out the character and the nature of Christ to the people around me?
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.320]   Because I have been equipped by my community together to be a work of service to the community
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.040]   I'm planted in.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:07.760]   But my sphere of influence, I'm the pastor to that sphere of influence," you should be
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.760]   thinking.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:15.120]   "I'm God's hands and feet to that place, and I can make a difference because of my community
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.140]   of faith and how we're serving one another and working together.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:24.520]   We can be living out acts of service wherever it is that you're planted."
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.480]   I think that's a glorious vision for church.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.320]   It's not about like, "Hey, let's all come in and contribute everything here," although
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.940]   we do need you to contribute things here, right?
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.940]   We need volunteers.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.940]   We need our helpers.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.240]   We need the worship team.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.720]   Everything that you see pretty much on a Sunday, most of it is run by volunteers.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.040]   Yeah, we need the help here, but really the heart that Paul has for the church is that
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.320]   it would be so equipped for the work that it has to do out there.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.200]   And that should inspire you.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.400]   That should fill you with a hunger to want to mature so that you can be a greater representation
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.860]   of Christ's hands and feet wherever it is that you might find yourself.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.840]   So Paul says all of this stuff, what it does as we prepare our works of service is that
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.720]   it brings unity together.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.000]   We are built up, as the church says, in unity.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I love that.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.800]   In other words, everybody here, if we were actually living out the call of the gospel
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.960]   in whatever sphere of influence we are, our role amongst each other should be to cheer
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   each other on.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.920]   It should be to say, "Wow, did you hear what this person did in the law firm the other
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.920]   week?
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.920]   It was amazing.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.400]   They were able to do this because they had this mindset of what justice was and the heart
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.920]   of God and justice, and they did that.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   We want to cheer you on.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.160]   We want to say, 'That was awesome.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   That's great.'"
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.120]   Or, "Hey, do you know that this person who's the CEO of this massive company, they're really
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.120]   struggling right now.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.200]   They're under a lot of pressure.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.000]   We need to gather around as a church and pray for them and stand with them so that they
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.880]   can be all that Christ has called them to be in that place in this season."
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.480]   Or, "Hey, you know this single mother who's having to raise two kids and she's struggling
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.880]   to pay rent every week?
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   Hey, come on.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.480]   We should be gathering around and building unity together to help her and provide for
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.040]   her and do whatever we can to make sure she's the best mom to those kids that she could
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.120]   possibly be."
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.440]   Could you imagine a church who's doing all of this stuff so that they could see unity
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.640]   be built up amongst themselves?
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.200]   That's something people would want to be a part of.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:15.560]   And this unity, Paul says, he said, "We build up this unity in two very specific things."
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:23.440]   He said, "The unity is found in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God."
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.400]   Faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.360]   This is what happens when unity is at work amongst us.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.120]   We have unity in faith and unity in knowledge.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.600]   Paul often brings faith and knowledge together when he's teaching.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.320]   And he does so because it's really important for him because these two things are slightly
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.920]   different emphasis for Paul.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.160]   Faith for Paul spoke mostly about our experience with God.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.760]   It spoke about our beliefs and our promises, our understanding the promises of God and
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.400]   our trust in Him.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:56.640]   The faith element was the bits where we don't understand, where we need faith.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.600]   Maybe we haven't got it all worked out in our mind so we have this faith to believe
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.160]   or faith to trust or faith to embrace the promises of God, even though perhaps we don't
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.960]   fully understand them at times or maybe we haven't felt them at times.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:13.460]   We have this faith in us, he says, and we have this unity together in faith in the Son
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.460]   of God.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.440]   But then he also says, "But it's also a knowledge."
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.480]   It's not all just about faith.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:24.840]   It's also about being rooted in understanding, having wisdom, having good doctrine, understanding
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.800]   theology, understanding the Scriptures.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.160]   This side is also important, Paul is saying.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:34.840]   Our unity, if you're a maturing church, our unity if you're a maturing Christian, is that
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.160]   you have feet in both of those camps, that you have a balance between your faith in the
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.360]   Son of God and you have a balance with your understanding, your knowledge of the Son of
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360]   God.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.040]   And he's like, you need to get both of those things in balance because if one of those
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:53.600]   things dominates more over the other, then you're going to be an immature church that's
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.720]   likely to be shaken by every whim of teaching that's going to come your way.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.480]   And we all know this, right?
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.800]   We all know those churches or those experiences where it's all built on just some spiritual
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.120]   dramatic experience, and yet it seems to lack the rootedness of Scripture.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.480]   And perhaps we've been in other churches at times where it's amazing the doctrinal understanding
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.080]   and teaching and yet it seems like it's dead, that it's not alive, that there's no spirit
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   involved.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.840]   And Paul's trying to teach the church where our unity comes, our maturity comes.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.920]   When we take both of those things and we embrace them and walk into them and find balance in
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.600]   our lives, here at the Vine we put it this way, we want you to be a spiritually intelligent
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.880]   Christian.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.160]   We want you to be so filled with the Spirit that you have those experiences of Christ.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.560]   You're gifted by the Spirit.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.860]   You know that the same Spirit in you is the one that raised Jesus from the dead.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.120]   You're praying for the sick.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.320]   You're looking for miracles.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.400]   You're expecting for that.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   We want that in you.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.280]   But we also want you to know your Word.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.560]   We want you to be rooted in Scripture.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.420]   We want you to understand theology.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.120]   We want you to know how the Bible works.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.920]   We want you to stand on that absolute truth and have that.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.040]   We want you to have both of those things at work in your life.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.480]   That's maturity, Paul says.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   That's what it is to grow.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.040]   Are you still with me?
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.280]   So all of this reaches to the end of the point where he says this, and so we would become
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:16.240]   mature, and notice how he defines maturity, "attaining to the whole measure of the fullness
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.800]   of God."
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   The whole measure of the fullness...
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.200]   Yeah, that's a good slide to take a photo of.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   Yep, everybody's taking a photo of that.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.200]   That's nice, isn't it?
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.680]   Although, ha, ha, ha, ha, there's one more bit, so sorry.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.520]   You're going to have to take a photo again in a few minutes' time.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.080]   But I want you to see, he's saying we become mature, "attaining to the whole measure of
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.360]   the fullness of Christ."
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.840]   Paul's vision is that you wouldn't miss out on anything that Christ has for you and for
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.840]   the church.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.760]   The fullness of Christ should be found in you and found in the church.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.920]   He's basically saying, look, Christ did not die so that you received a portion of His
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.000]   love.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.360]   Christ didn't die so that you would receive a portion of reconciliation, a portion of restoration.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:05.040]   Paul's like, no, a mature church and a mature person in Christ is someone who understands
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.400]   that they are receiving the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.000]   We don't do the vines so that you would get a half measure.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.800]   I mean, if that was our focus, then we may as well just wrap up and go home.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:24.680]   We do this because we want you to sense the wholeness of His love, the wholeness of restoration,
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:28.840]   the wholeness of your healing, whatever brokenness that you're with, whatever addiction you're
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.400]   struggling with, whatever overwhelming fear is in your workplace, whatever it is, divorce
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.800]   that you're struggling with in your marriage, a breakdown in a relationship, whatever it
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:43.680]   is, we want the wholeness of Christ for you in those areas so that you would feel fully
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.280]   alive in Him, forgiven, redeemed, restored, growing and making a difference so that you
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.720]   would have a limp like Jacob did, who wrestled with God because of the hard things and God
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:00.640]   touched him and he walked away touched by the work of God and able to reveal the beauty
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.960]   of His brokenness to those ahead and to point people towards the one who healed him.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.520]   And I pray that that is us, that that is what it means to be church.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.120]   That's growing big people.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.200]   And the question you've got to wrestle with here is when you see Paul map out, I mean,
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.820]   is that not a beautiful process that he's mapped out?
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.600]   When you see Paul map out a process like that, here's the question we think.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.380]   We think that Paul's being mean about people who are infants in Jesus.
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.780]   We could read that and think Paul's got a problem with people who are just coming to
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.180]   Jesus or don't know much about Jesus.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.940]   And if that's you here in this room, maybe you're new to faith or maybe you're wrestling
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.140]   with faith, you're not sure, I want you to hear this.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.980]   That is not what Paul is saying.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:46.220]   He is not coming against those who are infants in the faith.
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.860]   Equally, there are people who are mature in Christ Jesus who think because they've been
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.780]   Christians for 30, 40 years that they don't have much more to learn about Christ.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.140]   He's coming for those people actually.
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.140]   And he's saying both whether you're an infant in Christ or whether you think you're mature
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.620]   and you've got it all sorted out.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:07.540]   He's basically saying if you just stay stagnant where you're at, that's not what Christ wants.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:11.660]   He wants a maturing church, a maturing Christian.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.740]   And so if you're an infant, that's absolutely fine.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.580]   Your heart though should be, I want to learn, I want to grow, I want to deepen, I want to
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.580]   get mature.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.500]   And if you are a "mature" Christian, you should be challenging yourself and saying, have I
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.380]   plateaued, have I thought in arrogance that I know it all?
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.620]   Is there more for me to know of Christ?
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.620]   Absolutely there is.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:36.060]   And so whether infant or mature, the heart Paul is saying is that you have a starting
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:38.100]   point right in this process right now.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.060]   Whether you've been a Christian two weeks or two minutes or 20, 30, 40 years, there's
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:45.980]   a starting point for you and that's the final part of the slide.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.400]   You can now take a photo of the slide if you want to.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.280]   There is the starting point that we all have.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.500]   And that starting point is what you're being invited into today.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:03.980]   If this is your home church, I hope what I've shared with you today out of Paul's vision,
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.660]   remember, this is not actually the Vine's vision as in like we've come up with something
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.980]   special.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.940]   Our vision is that vision and that vision is Paul's vision for his church, okay?
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.980]   This is Paul mapping out what maturity in the church looks like, but that is what we
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.660]   align ourselves and that's what we mean when we say we're here to grow big people.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.920]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.140]   That's everything we do strategically.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.300]   We want that process to be at work in our ministries and how we do things.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.700]   We want that process to be at work in your life and everything you experience.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.420]   We'd love that process to be at work outside the four walls of a 90-minute Sunday service.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.720]   That's our heart and our passion.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.980]   The question you've got to ask yourself is where are you starting on your ever going
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.460]   maturity journey today?
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:47.620]   And so for some of you in this room, your starting point might be like, "You know what?
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:50.380]   I need to understand more about the truth.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:52.800]   You know what, I've shied away a little bit from God's absolute truth.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.080]   Maybe I've been a bit scared about it.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   I need to actually embrace it.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.820]   I need to read my scriptures a bit more.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.300]   I need to talk to somebody about that.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.600]   I need to understand what are the foundations of gospel.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.760]   I need to understand what is doctrine.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.080]   I don't even know what doctrine is or theology.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.460]   I need someone to walk with me.
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.860]   Maybe it's to sign up for a BSF class or do a manna class here at the Vine where we do
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.200]   Bible teaching with you.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.260]   It could be a whole variety of different things, but you're kind of saying, "That's my starting
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.260]   point."
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.080]   Or maybe for some of you it's to get into a community group.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.400]   You realize that you've been anonymous here too long and you've been wondering why it
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.520]   is that maybe you're not growing as much as you thought.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:28.160]   Let me tell you this, you will grow far more with eight to nine to ten people around your
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.420]   life who know your story and you know their story than you will from attending a lifetime's
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.720]   worth of 90 minutes on a Sunday.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.760]   That's where true discipleship takes place.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.400]   Not here, as much as we love what we're doing here.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.600]   I know I've said that a few times today, but we love this, but that's actually not the
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.960]   fullness of your discipleship.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.880]   Your discipleship will go to the next level when you commit your life to communing with
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.880]   people.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.240]   So, CGs, community groups, massive.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.620]   Maybe that's your starting point here today.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.920]   Maybe your starting point is to say, "Hey, look, I want to be equipped more for works
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.920]   of service.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   I realize I've become stagnant.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.100]   I realize that I basically just live my faith on a Sunday and I don't live my faith much
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.100]   outwards.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.560]   I realize that God has gifted me, but I'm not really using those gifts."
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.120]   You're thinking, "I want to actually think about what it means for me to serve the city
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.480]   of Hong Kong, to serve my bank, to serve that law firm, that educational institution, whatever
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.320]   it might be, serve my family.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.200]   I want to learn more about that.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.320]   That's my starting point."
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.240]   Or maybe for some of you, it's this faith in the knowledge.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.840]   "I want to get that balance better in my life.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.120]   I've got a little bit too much of the experience.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.200]   I feel like I'm lacking."
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.240]   Or, "I feel like I've got too much of this, but I want to learn what are the gifts of
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   the Spirit like.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.040]   I want to have somebody pray for me to receive some of the gifts.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.120]   I want to do more of that."
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.920]   And so, maybe it's like you want to get that balance of faith and knowledge better in your
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   life.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.320]   I don't know what it is for you, but my challenge is, if this is your church, this is what we're
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:46.320]   about.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.800]   And I said this at the Aniphothene.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.600]   I want to say this again, and I'm saying it to you at the two as well.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.480]   And I'm not joking this.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.480]   This is everything that the Vine is about.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:01.180]   So if this doesn't excite you, or if this is not what you want, I totally respect that,
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:05.280]   and I would say, "Go check out some other churches."
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.440]   And I mean that because this is who we are, and this is what we're going to pour our time
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.080]   and energy and leadership into.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.080]   This is what.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.480]   And if you align with this, every Sunday when you come in, my heart and my prayer is that
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.920]   you'll feel like you're growing.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.240]   You'll feel like you're maturing.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.520]   You'll feel like you're being challenged.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.640]   You'll feel like the truth is being spoken in love.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.600]   You'll feel all of those things, and that will help you to grow.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.520]   And if you align with that, then the starting point is your question today.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.440]   How am I starting in that journey?
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.360]   And I pray that this excites you as much as it excites me.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.320]   And this is what's going to continue to be at the forefront of us as we hold forth and
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.840]   fast to the Word of God amongst us.
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.560]   Can I pray for us?
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:51.520]   Why don't you stand with me, and I'll pray for you.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:52.960]   I hope people come back next week, though.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:00.800]   I did kind of mean that, but hopefully you resonate with what we're talking about.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.720]   Things you regret later.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.960]   Okay.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:08.480]   Father, we just are so grateful that we are here together.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.960]   And I wonder if this is resonating with you.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   This is your home church.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:16.280]   Can I just encourage you to just put your hands out as I pray, and I want to just commission
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.000]   you into the things that we're talking about.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.080]   And if you're visiting from another church or somewhere else, you can receive, of course,
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.880]   receive this as well for whatever context Christ has planted you into.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:33.720]   So as your hands are open, Father, we thank you that you called the vine to grow big people.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.320]   Thank you, Lord, that each person here represents a wonderful, created human being that you
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.960]   love so much, that the image of God is placed within, and that you're wanting to see flourish.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:52.880]   Father, I thank you that we have amazing doctors and nurses and teachers and educational professors.
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.160]   We have entrepreneurs.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.360]   We have people in politicians, people in the government, police.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.280]   Lord, we have all aspects of societies represented across our services.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.920]   Lord, that is such a beautiful thing.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:04.920]   Thank you.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:09.520]   Thank you, Lord, that you've blessed this community with variety and diversity.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:16.760]   Lord, I want to pray that there will be a unity felt amongst us as you build us up for
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.120]   works of service.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.840]   Lord, I want to pray for each person here who's saying the vine is their home church.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.960]   I want to pray that this starting point that you're putting on their spirit right now would
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.880]   be their next step in deepening their journey with us as a community of faith.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.640]   More than that, deepening their own journey in relationship with you, Lord.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.320]   I pray that we as a church will be able to serve that next step as best as we can, knowing
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.960]   that we won't always get it right and that we'll make mistakes along the way.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.160]   Lord, I pray that more than that, the people of this room would love each other, would
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:54.720]   love and encourage and cheer each other on deeply in the spirits of influence and the
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.640]   works of service that they are doing.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.560]   Lord, I want to pray that there would be such unity at the vine between experience of you,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.960]   the heart and the faith and the works of the spirit and the power that there is in the
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.720]   spirit as well as the depth of your word and the roots of doctrine and good theology.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:17.280]   And Lord, I pray that those two things would come together in a beautiful way, Lord, that
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.400]   we would find ourselves deeper in knowledge and in faith of the Son of God.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:27.480]   And Lord, I pray for that whole measure, the whole measure of the whole measure of the
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:32.880]   whole measure of the fullness of Christ over each person.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:38.680]   And so Lord, today as we respond in worship, Lord, I want to just pray, maybe just you
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.200]   take the time as we worship now to think about what is my next step?
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.000]   What is my starting point?
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.700]   And maybe after the service you want to come forward and have someone pray for you.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.280]   Maybe for some of you that's the foster care situation we were talking about earlier.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.080]   You know, those next steps might be things that you're going to do, making room for God
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.360]   by serving the poor and the vulnerable, the marginalized of our city.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.960]   Maybe some of you want to do that as a next step.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.800]   It might be a lot of different things, but take the time to hear from the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.160]   And if you'd like prayer, we're going to have a team that will pray for you at the end of
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.360]   the service around that as well.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.400]   But as we respond, we do so asking Him to mature us and to grow us into big people.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
