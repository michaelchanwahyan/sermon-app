[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Once I was traveling with dear friend to a certain place,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.380]   to be away from a most troubled context,
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.620]   reflecting on the significance
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.740]   and the puzzling circumstances of things.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.580]   At the time, I and my company
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.360]   could only identify discouragement and unbelief.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.180]   Then we met someone on the road, a stranger to us.
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.900]   Somehow we caught up and chatted.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.220]   And rather unusual to my introvert's inclination,
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.740]   I actually expressed some of my profound discouragement.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.780]   At the long faith journey in Christ,
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.780]   in a lato of hopes of how the kingdom of God may manifest,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.520]   and me as a believer in Christ,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.360]   together with my fellow believers in the city,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.500]   could be part of this.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.520]   Yes, the circumstances and happenings
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.120]   seemingly dashed all such hopes.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.760]   Well, I least expected that this gentleman responded
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.240]   by rebuking us for our hardness of heart.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.100]   He even pointed us to the Bible
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.560]   concerning the manifestation of the kingdom.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.140]   We did another extraordinary thing.
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.440]   We invite him to join us for dinner,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.500]   and there was a great time of fellowship.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.940]   Then it dawned on us, well, that this person
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.120]   is no stranger.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.760]   We used to know him.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.100]   That's why our hearts burned,
[00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.740]   even as we shared bread and the cries of our hearts.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.980]   Somehow we find renewed hope,
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.740]   and actually decided to call off our departure,
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.200]   and return to where we came from,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.440]   because we find new hope, new purposes.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   You may by now guess this stranger's name is Jesus.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.440]   Luke chapter 24 recorded for us
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.640]   the account of two disciples
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.280]   going down the road to Emmaus.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.400]   Cleopas and his company represented discouragement
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.780]   and unbelief of Jesus' followers.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.840]   When they met Jesus on the road,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.300]   his identity was somehow hidden from them,
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.600]   and they expressed their profound disappointment
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.860]   at the tragic events in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.960]   They had hoped that he might be the Messiah
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.300]   who would redeem Israel,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.160]   yet his death on the cross dashed all such hopes.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.920]   Jesus responded by rebuking them
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.600]   for their hardness of heart.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.800]   Did not the scriptures predict
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.900]   the suffering of the Messiah?
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.680]   Even though now equipped with the truths of the scripture,
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.280]   the disciples did not recognize Jesus,
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.420]   until they invited him into fellowship
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.520]   around the dining table.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.840]   Jesus broke bread,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.820]   Jesus commune with them,
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.980]   and now they recognize Jesus.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.180]   Jesus disappeared from their presence,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.000]   and they joyfully returned to Jerusalem
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.140]   to report their experience.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.460]   There they find the other disciples,
[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.640]   announcing the same good news.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.920]   Jesus is indeed a rise.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.920]   I'm thankful for Andrew's invitation
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.360]   to share something from my heart.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.680]   Please take me as a fellow brother in this congregation
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.120]   and from the internet.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.260]   I'm hopeful what is laid in my heart
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.420]   also finds resonance in you.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.900]   What I want to share from the scripture today
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.280]   is about my own reflections in church life
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.040]   and how we can best express it.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.760]   It just happens that I have only attended
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.420]   three churches in my lifetime.
[00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.260]   10 years in a very local traditional Chinese church,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.260]   and 10 years in the Assemblies of God Church in Singapore,
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.100]   and of course, 14 years here in the Vine.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.360]   We got a bit more involved in church life
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.840]   as we participated in the first Chinese Alpha
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.040]   from 10 years ago.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.000]   I want to reflect some of my concerns
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   and my faith commitments, rooted, reach out, and renewal.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.720]   Let's return to the Bible first.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.780]   For Luke's readers, including us,
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.400]   basically this is a call to come out of the fog
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.960]   of disappointment that these two disciples left in two,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.620]   and instead, dare to believe the promises of his word
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.440]   as we fellowship with Christ.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.320]   Interestingly, there's an epilogue to this event.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.300]   Jesus appeared again and fellowshiped with his disciples
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.880]   over the dining table in Jerusalem.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.760]   Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.060]   This is what I told you while I was still with you.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.020]   Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.780]   And he opened their minds
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.520]   so that they could understand the scriptures.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.100]   You are witnesses to all these things,
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.740]   and you will be closed with power from high above.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.820]   Jesus is talking about the Holy Spirit and empowerment.
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.100]   And Jesus reveals himself
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.460]   while in table fellowship with his disciples.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.960]   He is indeed at home in our midst, in our everyday activity.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.220]   So how shall we apply all these scriptures into our life?
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.440]   What is my cry of the heart for my fellow brothers
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.880]   and sisters here in the vine?
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.200]   So I've mentioned the three R's.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.840]   To be rooted deeply in his word,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.600]   to reach out with fervor, and that is the mandate,
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.180]   and to renew our hearts, be connected with him.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.400]   During the early days while we were still dating,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.100]   and of course we are still dating,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.520]   I loved writing letters to my then girlfriend
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.480]   and now my wife Vivian.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.800]   Yes, love letters,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.220]   so that I may express my love for her in writing.
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.500]   When we had a committed relationship,
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.000]   I actually gave her my diary.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.540]   I was open to her,
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.560]   and my story was passed on to her in writing.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.160]   I would hope that she would read my love letters
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.260]   in my diary time and again,
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.620]   so that she would know me, and she would know my love for her.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.120]   With some degree of similarity,
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.020]   God conveyed his love message to us in writing,
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.820]   so that we can read time and again.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.000]   So David, the psalmist, encouraged us.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.580]   I'll hide your word in my heart
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.600]   that I would not sin against you.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.420]   The biblical sense of knowing
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.800]   is actually to have an intimate relationship.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.060]   It is just inconsistent if we say
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.060]   we want to know his plan for our lives,
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.180]   and yet somehow we remain complacent
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.460]   in trying and getting to know him.
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.860]   The yearning to know him more could differ
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.180]   depending on your own unique situation.
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.820]   I'm encouraged to know that many fellow brothers and sisters
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.200]   are committed to studies offered by,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.160]   say for example, the Bible Study Fellowship,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.080]   or other Bible study groups in your own community groups.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.160]   But on the other hand, I'm sometimes frustrated
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.800]   that some of us hardly make an effort
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.860]   to allow his word to speak to us on a daily basis.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.180]   Anyway, for me, at the age of 50,
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.020]   I did enroll for seminary studies
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.820]   as I desired to know him more.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.380]   Yet, one of my greatest understanding of his word
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.260]   is when my own circumstances become so conflicting.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.220]   The time point was at the second year
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.300]   of my five-year part-time study program.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.720]   I was enthusiastic to be equipped for service.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.660]   It was then that I was diagnosed with leukemia,
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.640]   a blood cancer.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:37.560]   I struggled to reconcile the disruption to my plan.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.260]   I was serving him through my second half of my life.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.780]   And studying to know God's word
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.460]   become almost like a disillusion.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.940]   What is the point of knowing him more
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.580]   when ultimately we shall know him in perfection?
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.720]   For now, we see only a reflection as in a mirror.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.780]   Then we shall see him face to face.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.000]   There is a dilemma.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.680]   So much needs to be done.
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   So many need to be served.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.060]   And so much relationship to be treasured.
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.620]   And so did the time.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.420]   It was at this point that his word brings clarity.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.060]   There's new light as I read.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.820]   For to me, to live is Christ.
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:34.500]   If I am to go on living in this body,
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.800]   in this body, this will mean fruitful labor for me.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.360]   Somehow I find comfort that he knows best.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.920]   There's a perfect timing in his plans.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.420]   And by knowing him more, I actually learned
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.500]   to trust him more.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.320]   I actually decided to bite the bullet
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.960]   and carried on with my studies
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   and my own clinical practice.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.120]   And at the same time, went through my chemotherapy
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.880]   treatment, which was spread over two years.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.860]   Today I'm glad to report that I've graduated
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.960]   from the seminary.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.100]   [audience applauding]
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.820]   And I have finished my treatment.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.820]   [audience applauding]
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.740]   Now you don't have to go through seminary
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.420]   or chemotherapy to help you make a tough choice
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.680]   whether to study his word.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.380]   You just need to make a commitment and do it.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.740]   That daily application of God's word in our ordinary lives
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.280]   is exactly what God desires for all of us
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.660]   in the secular world.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.760]   How about you?
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.120]   Knowing God's word through diligence studies
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.200]   will anchor you to face whatever lies ahead of you.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.940]   It can be COVID, it can be losing a job,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:01.480]   a relationship, or even a loved one.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.180]   But his word will help us navigate
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.240]   the worst moments in life.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.120]   Isn't that good news?
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.880]   Our knowing him should actually find a way
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.420]   of expressing through testifying.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.440]   When we know him, we naturally want to share the good news.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.300]   On the road to Emmaus, the two despondent
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.140]   disciples were revived and they were given
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.280]   new purposes in life.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.040]   They were summoned to bear witness for the resurrection.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.820]   By the way, the Greek word to bear testimony
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.440]   is the same as to be martyrs.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.220]   Well, we can at least imagine the seriousness
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.220]   of the mandate to bear testimony, witness for Christ.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.960]   Well, lest we get too nervous about sharing,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.120]   let's remember the Holy Spirit is always there.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.960]   He dwells in us to help us make sense of our testimony.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.040]   Around the world, that testimony is shared
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.980]   one message at a time.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.440]   It can be shared by a missionary or by a preacher.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.400]   But it can also be by a housewife with his neighbor,
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.180]   by a business person with his colleague.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   And for the 11 o'clock service with a lot of families,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.880]   it can be by a father or a mother
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.800]   with his precious son or daughter.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.640]   Or even by a child with his beloved parent or grandparent.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.260]   Testifying can come in moments of joy or despair,
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.940]   or even at death's door.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:50.500]   I was probably like any one of you,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.560]   considering that sharing the gospel is just an option
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.440]   and not something to be pursued for fear of rejection.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.360]   Many years back while I was practicing in Singapore,
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   in the line of work I came across this young man
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.060]   with very aggressive cancer.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:13.080]   As his disease progressed, I actually contemplated
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.740]   to share the gospel with him.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.000]   That opportunity never came.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.760]   He left into a coma.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.380]   By then nothing very much could be offered medically.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.780]   But I did offer to the devastated wife,
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.220]   well, that maybe I could connect her to a pastor
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.980]   from the church to pray for her husband
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.420]   and maybe for the family.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.980]   It was a Sunday.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:41.700]   Everyone else had their own commitments.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.260]   And to my disbelief, my pastor challenged me
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.320]   to be the one to share the gospel with her
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.720]   and to pray for the man.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.780]   I felt so inadequate, so unprepared,
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.100]   so lacking in faith, and so clumsy in my mentoring.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.220]   By asking my wife to come along,
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.720]   we did share the gospel and prayed with her.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.300]   And we led her to Christ.
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.160]   This encounter had a tremendous impact
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.180]   on how I view myself as that person chosen
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.680]   at the right time to be empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.760]   like any one of you, to be the right person
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.840]   at the right time, at the right place,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.440]   to share a testimony.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.920]   Once that commitment was made, doors just opened.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.280]   I had this encounter with a lady
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.800]   who scolded me so badly about my care
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.400]   for his father's cancer.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:46.020]   We only find out that subsequently
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.480]   we were from the same church.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.740]   Well, it happens for a big church
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.180]   with more than 3,000 members.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.820]   And I could understand that she was really stressed
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.960]   by his diagnosis.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.660]   Anyway, along the way, we actually worked together
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.780]   and led his father to Christ.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.300]   And even community groups can come together
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.400]   to be a blessing.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.660]   A lady was stuck in the hospital for months.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.180]   My group, my home group came around
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.520]   and visited her in the hospital,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.440]   reached out for her family with four young kids,
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.960]   and even brought her out to Ritz-Carlton
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.240]   to celebrate her birthday.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.900]   She used to be a Buddhist,
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.900]   but she found tremendous joy in knowing Christ
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.140]   before she departed.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.780]   We should just seize the opportunities
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.780]   once we are prompted by the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.880]   And I'm thankful to be brought up in a church culture
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.820]   where testifying, sharing the gospel
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.680]   anywhere, anytime, to anyone, is just natural.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.560]   We just embrace that simple commitment
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.640]   to share the gospel and bring one person to Christ
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.540]   every year.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.540]   There was also a rich Pentecostal heritage.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.780]   We just believe in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:14.220]   Where doors are seemingly closed, it can be opened.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.600]   We can take down spiritual strongholds.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.420]   We can speak prophetically when we hear from God,
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.040]   and we can bring hope where there seems to be no hope.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.940]   An invitation is all that really matters.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.620]   It is not so much because death is looming.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.380]   Rather, it is an invitation to new life.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.060]   My late parents came to know the Lord
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.620]   when they're in their late 70s.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.080]   Someone visited them week after week,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.460]   drive them to church while they were stuck in Toronto
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.220]   with no means of transportation and no social life.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.940]   My wife came to know the Lord
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.760]   as some stranger housewife befriended her
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.100]   in the swimming pool where all the moms
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.160]   took the kids to learn to swim.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.360]   She experienced the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.260]   the very first time she stepped into the church.
[00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.560]   She was just stirred to weep,
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.620]   even though she never cried in adulthood.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:22.300]   Indeed, the church is not a members club for believers,
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   but a place whereby seekers should be welcomed and embraced.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.420]   Could this church do that?
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:36.900]   I am eternally grateful for the different ones
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.900]   who invited me and my family to know the Lord.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.800]   I want to be the one who invites someone
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.480]   to receive that eternal blessing.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:54.780]   So my encouragement, be upfront in sharing your faith.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.760]   Don't be an undercover agent.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.220]   Be ready.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.260]   You should not be surprised when your colleague
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.920]   come forth to ask for your counsel and your prayers.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.700]   Be intentional to build relationship.
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.400]   Be authentic in caring.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.360]   Invite a friend to Chinese offer,
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.840]   even though you may not be a Chinese speaker.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.420]   We do our best, God will do the rest.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.400]   Embrace your work.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.780]   That is the most powerful testimony in the workplace.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:34.840]   So far I've shared about rootedness in this word,
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.800]   as in the head.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.600]   Reaching out to testify as in the hand.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.100]   I wonder whether you notice that between the knowing
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.460]   and the doing, there's still something missing.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.000]   The heart matter.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.800]   And probably for many of us,
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.500]   the most difficult is the transformation of the heart.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.280]   The Emmaus encounter reminded us
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.260]   that Jesus spent time with the disciples
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.060]   who were so disappointed, disillusioned.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.940]   And yet, we witness that there's a major reversal
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   of emotion, transforming despair into hope and action.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.920]   All is not lost.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.320]   The resurrected Jesus is in the midst of us right now,
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.020]   even when we are not aware.
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.260]   All it takes is our willingness
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.760]   to have our hearts transformed.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.460]   The journey of the heart,
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.260]   despite the short distance from the head,
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.580]   is just not easy for many of us.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.940]   My wife is heavily involved in prayer ministry
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.900]   and inner healing.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.220]   She often asks me, "How do you feel?"
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.660]   I would rather she ask, "What do you think?
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.780]   "What shall we do?"
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.380]   Well, of course I knew some of the dark side
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.620]   from my own childhood.
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.940]   It was very difficult economically in the '60s.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.100]   My wife conceived, my mom, I always say my wife, sorry.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.740]   [audience laughing]
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.460]   My mom.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.060]   I loved my wife as much as I loved my mom.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.700]   [audience laughing]
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.240]   Anyway, in the '60s, so you can guess my age.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:29.900]   My '60s, in the '60s, my mom conceived me
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.060]   and she was then at the age of 40.
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:38.320]   And somehow, as she anticipated a lot of hardship ahead,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.660]   she actually tried, and she tried very hard to abort me.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:48.680]   Well, by God's grace, I do not have too many physical
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.220]   or mental defects, as far as I know.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:55.900]   Yeah, but surely there were a lot of racial defects
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.620]   from those emotional trauma while still inside the womb.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.340]   She was in great distress, and to some extent,
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.820]   she passed on a lot of those fears
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.600]   and pessimistic outlook into my own life.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.140]   She went through her own transformation
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.260]   as she subsequently managed to share this opening
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.240]   with myself.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.220]   But in turn, I need my own renewal of heart
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.100]   to change my generally negative outlook in life.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.560]   In my own practice, I used to spend a lot of time
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.280]   on organ transplantation.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.140]   It is often and never taken, it is not often,
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   and really, we should never take it for granted
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.400]   that organs becomes available.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.140]   Someone needs to be willing to give.
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.900]   And the dilemma for heart transplant is even more intense.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.300]   Someone needs to die to make a heart available
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.500]   for a person in need.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.460]   But Jesus has already died that death,
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.300]   and he's ready to give that new heart to us.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.540]   I will remove from you your heart of stone
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.820]   and give you a heart of flesh.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.700]   It would then be up to us to receive that gift
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.060]   from our donor, Jesus.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:33.180]   If there's a moment that I literally cried from my heart,
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.180]   that was five years ago, when I wept, I cried,
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.460]   or even yelled, so much so that my wife,
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.380]   who was sound asleep at three o'clock in the morning
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:50.220]   in the upper room, heard my cry and rushed to comfort me.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.220]   I was in great despair when I read through
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.220]   the medical literature to find out that
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.100]   the predicted median survival,
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:10.180]   the years to live for my type of leukemia
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.740]   would be eight years.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:19.860]   I did not go down a literal road to Emmaus,
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.280]   but I was distraught.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.640]   My wife came around to keep me company.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.360]   Then somehow and knowingly, Jesus,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:38.840]   a stranger to me, since I hardly recognized him,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.320]   Jesus also came along.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.800]   He helped me to know how foolish I was
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.640]   and how slow of heart to believe
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.760]   in all that he has spoken.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.640]   But most significantly, he embraced us.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   The three of us had a time of fellowship
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.600]   with prayers and commitments.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.760]   My heart was transformed.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.500]   Late completion of a heart transplant surgery,
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.960]   it was pumping again.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.680]   So allow your heart to cry.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.360]   Cry out to Jesus.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.680]   Cry out to your loved ones.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.820]   And my desire for this church community
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.640]   is such that we find trusted fellow brothers and sisters
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.600]   whom we can cry out to to journey together
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.000]   and to receive healing together.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.280]   The disciples who were once so discouraged
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.440]   now become a community of believers
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.640]   with transformed hearts,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   coming together to testify his goodness
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.240]   while welcoming others.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   In fact, every day they continue to meet together
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.000]   in the temple court.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.600]   They broke bread in their homes
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.680]   and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.480]   praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   And the Lord added to their number daily
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.760]   those who were being saved.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.220]   So my encouragement is be committed to a community.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.720]   Invite your pre-believer friends to your community
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.780]   to share the goodness of Christ.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.760]   And for yourself, be open to inner healing
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.760]   and prayer ministry.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.200]   Begin your own journey of the heart today.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.600]   As we draw this sharing to a close,
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.840]   hear the cry of my heart for this congregation.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.160]   Let us be committed to be rooted in his word.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.680]   Be passionate in testifying
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.800]   and to continue our journey of the heart.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.760]   I do want to have a chance for all of us
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.800]   to respond to this message.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.040]   Can I invite the band
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.760]   and I also invite all of you to stand with us.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.840]   (audience murmuring)
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.920]   There will be some of you
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.600]   who want to renew your commitment
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.680]   to know him through diligent studies
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.760]   so that you can trust him more.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.240]   Come, make that commitment today.
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.840]   You will hear him speaking to you through his word.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.920]   Some of you are stirred.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.360]   You want to be that good friend
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.760]   who invites his friend to come to know Jesus.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.800]   Be bold to ask today for the privilege
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.000]   to be that right person at the right place
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.240]   at the right time for that person you love.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.180]   And some of you are crying from your heart.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.600]   You yearn for a renewal,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.280]   but you don't know where to start.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.200]   Come, have fellowship with Christ.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.360]   The altar is open.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.120]   Our prayer team wants to partner with you,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.920]   to pray alongside with you,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.960]   to voice out, to shout out to the Lord
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.480]   your commitments to be rooted,
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:35.720]   to reach out and to renew.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.120]   So this is a time for you to come forth,
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.440]   to open your hearts
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.800]   and to stop false,
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.440]   to be prayerful in a community of believers.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.600]   Even in the upper house,
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.480]   our pastoral staff is ready to pray
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.480]   with whoever wants to have someone to pray alongside.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.600]   Come.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:27.120]   And for some of you who already made that commitment,
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.640]   I want also that you can invite
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.760]   someone standing next to you
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.080]   as long as you are comfortable.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.900]   You may not even know that person,
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:45.480]   but yes, you invite him to pray with you
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.640]   so that you would be the one
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.440]   who invites someone to Jesus.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.880]   You can also invite yourself
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.080]   to come and meet up with Jesus.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   So spend that time as the one standing next to you.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.920]   Commit in prayers that you will indeed,
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:14.240]   you will indeed invite someone to Jesus
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.760]   and that someone can also be yourself.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.080]   Okay, shall we go for a time of prayer,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.760]   mutual ministry, pray with each other
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.920]   and we spend good time praying with
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.320]   and praying for each other.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.900]   (gentle music)
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.480]   (gentle music)
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.060]   (gentle music)
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.480]   (gentle music)
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.060]   (gentle music)
