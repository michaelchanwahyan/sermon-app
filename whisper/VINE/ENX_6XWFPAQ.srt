1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 So there was this moment that happened for me

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,800
 on my recent walk of the Camino de Santiago in Spain

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,560
 that deeply reminds me of what we have just been

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,040
 singing about in that song.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,500
 The Camino is around about 800 kilometers of length.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,880
 You walk from this place called Saint John in France

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,260
 all the way to Santiago de Compostela

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,000
 in the west coast of Spain.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,920
 And as you walk every day, you connect to

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,880
 and walk through and past multiple Catholic churches.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,520
 In fact, on any particular given day,

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,840
 you might walk through say three to five different villages

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,340
 and every single one of those villages

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,880
 will be centered around some form of church,

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,320
 this Catholic church.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,040
 And some of those churches are incredibly beautiful,

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,120
 huge, wonderful buildings, like architectural wonders.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,200
 Some of those churches are small, rural,

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,320
 almost forgotten churches where maybe inside

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,520
 there is nothing more than a couple of pews

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,360
 and a rusty old iron cross.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,600
 And I used to love when I was walking the Camino

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,500
 to take every opportunity I could to connect with a church.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,720
 If I was walking past a church,

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
 inevitably those churches would be open.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,440
 And most of the time, they were open and no one was in there

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,520
 and so I loved that because it meant that I could go in,

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,340
 have a time of solitude, maybe take my backpack off

29
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,360
 for 10 minutes and just sit there and pray

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
 and encounter the presence of God.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,120
 These churches were like wonderful gifts of solitude

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,920
 as we walked every day.

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,640
 Well, on this particular day,

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,920
 I was walking into this small village

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
 and I noticed that there was a church

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,400
 that was off the trail.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,360
 Now, this was somewhat unusual because usually the Camino,

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,700
 the official trail, takes you to the center of a village

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,480
 or the center of a town and right up to the big church

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,700
 in the center of the town.

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,760
 But for whatever reason, in this particular village,

42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,960
 the Camino path was going straight ahead

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
 and avoiding the little church that was over to the left.

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,480
 And I saw it would take me maybe about five or seven minutes

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,440
 to walk over to that church and I had time

46
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,840
 and so I decided, okay, look, I'm gonna go off the path,

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,520
 I'm gonna go over there and I'm going to just have my time

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,100
 of solitude in this church.

49
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,560
 So I enter into this church.

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,800
 It's a small church.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,880
 It's probably got about, maybe it could seat

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,800
 maybe 50 people in total, so a small kind of church.

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,360
 As I walk straight in, I'm the only person there

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,800
 or at least I thought I was, but as soon as I walk in,

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,720
 I hear this kind of like person get up from sitting down

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
 over on the right side and it's this old nun

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,720
 and she runs up to me with this big smile on her face

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,960
 and she's so excited that a pilgrim has entered the church.

59
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,400
 I could tell from her face that she's been waiting

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,080
 a long time for someone to come and visit her in her church

61
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,920
 and she's got this big smile on her face

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,760
 and she literally runs up to me and she grabs my arms

63
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,880
 with her little hands and she starts speaking to me

64
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,600
 excitedly in Spanish.

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,780
 Now, if you know me, you'll know I know nothing

66
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,200
 of Spanish at all, but in that moment,

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,140
 I could see her enthusiasm and her joy that I had visited,

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,500
 so I didn't want to break her heart by telling her

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,260
 I didn't speak Spanish.

70
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,520
 So I just let her talk and as she talked,

71
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,940
 I followed her nonverbal cues as to pretend

72
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,500
 that I understood her, so if she smiled,

73
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,720
 I would be like, oh.

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
 If she nodded, I would be like, mm.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,720
 And I basically was trying to pretend like,

76
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
 I think probably after a while,

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,640
 she realized I couldn't speak Spanish,

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,000
 but anyway, she kept going and she was so enthusiastic,

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,180
 so excited, she grabbed me on the arm

80
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,220
 and she started to walk me through her church.

81
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,140
 Now, again, it's not a particularly big church,

82
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,280
 but there were like paintings and icons all over this church

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
 as there often are in Catholic churches

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,960
 and so she wanted to like show me and tell me

85
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,800
 in incredibly detailed Spanish all about these paintings

86
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,080
 and the icons and so I'm polite and I'm nice

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,040
 and so I'm following her along and nodding

88
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,200
 at the right times and laughing at the right time.

89
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,320
 We get about halfway around and by this time,

90
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,400
 we're standing at the front where the kind of nave

91
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,640
 of the church is and we're standing there

92
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,520
 and she's talking away and we hear somebody else

93
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,560
 enter the church and so we both kind of turn

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,520
 and sure enough, in the entrance of the church,

95
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,560
 another pilgrim walks in.

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,960
 Now, this pilgrim, you can tell he's a pilgrim

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,720
 'cause he's wearing his backpack and everything,

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,880
 looks like a pilgrim, he's probably in his late 50s,

99
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,740
 early 60s and he comes in and he stands literally inside

100
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,160
 the entrance of the church and he starts to weep.

101
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,960
 Now, this is not just like your standard

102
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,440
 kind of like a couple of tears, a little bit embarrassed,

103
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,220
 sort of don't really mean to be crying here at the moment

104
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,220
 kind of tears, this was like a wailing kind of mourning,

105
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,240
 kind of gnashing of teeth, kind of very loud

106
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,880
 sort of sobbing that this man was doing.

107
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,600
 The nun stares up at me and her eyes are filled

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,760
 with this beautiful picture of compassion

109
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,720
 and she leaves me straight away and I don't know

110
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,180
 if you have ever seen a nun run.

111
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,100
 But if you ever get the chance to see a nun run,

112
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,040
 I highly recommend it.

113
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,400
 She leaves me and she hitches up like the skirt

114
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,740
 of her habit and she runs down the center of the church

115
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,980
 to this man.

116
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,160
 She runs up to him and embraces him in this big hug

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,560
 and then she gingerly and tenderly walks him

118
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,940
 and sits him down in one of the pews

119
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,720
 and she begins to pray for him.

120
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,220
 And there is this profound moment that something

121
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,020
 is happening in this little church that no one

122
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,820
 perhaps expected and that moment of great compassion

123
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,260
 of hers and the running towards the one in need

124
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,900
 filled and stirred compassion in me.

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,240
 And I remember feeling to myself like I just came in here

126
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,640
 to connect with Jesus but actually now is a chance

127
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,740
 for me to be pastoral and so I walked, I didn't run,

128
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,680
 I walked down the church and I came up against the man

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,280
 and I just gently placed my hand on his shoulder

130
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,460
 and I began to pray and the nun is praying fervently

131
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,380
 for him and he's loudly wailing and crying

132
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,500
 and I didn't know anything about this man at that moment

133
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,220
 but a few days later I discovered that he was

134
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,260
 a Portuguese man and he had been a homicide detective

135
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,620
 for 20 years and he was walking the Camino

136
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,420
 just as he is retired, he's walking the Camino

137
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,300
 to purge the evil that he had seen out of himself

138
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,360
 over 20 years.

139
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,620
 And something happened in that moment where he walks

140
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,260
 into that church, the Holy Spirit meets with him

141
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,380
 and we have this profound encounter together

142
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,260
 and as we're standing there praying over him,

143
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,340
 we're praying in human languages that are mixed

144
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,060
 and only partially understood but we're also praying

145
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,660
 in a heart and emotional language that is clear

146
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,420
 and fully understood, perhaps more understood

147
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,460
 than any other language can be and that's the universal

148
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,160
 language of unadulterated love.

149
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,860
 Love.

150
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,460
 I wonder if you've ever tried to describe love

151
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,780
 or try to find words to explain to somebody what love is.

152
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,100
 It's actually really hard, isn't it, to kind of use

153
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,180
 language to try to describe a factual or logical

154
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,160
 understanding of what love is but when we're swept up

155
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,780
 in a moment of love, when love breaks through barriers

156
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,460
 and begins to do what only love can do,

157
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,580
 well it lifts something in us as human beings, doesn't it?

158
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,520
 It creates something within us and it binds us together

159
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,020
 as humans like nothing ever can where three strangers

160
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,220
 who don't even speak the same language can find

161
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,500
 a deeper connection than in any other time.

162
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,260
 When love breaks through, humans become just the way

163
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,020
 they were created to be.

164
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,380
 It's interesting, I wonder if you've ever thought

165
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,380
 of love that way, that love actually makes us truly human,

166
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,100
 that the moments of pure love are our most natural

167
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,160
 and rawest moments as human beings.

168
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,300
 There's a lot of talk right now about AI

169
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,820
 and about the future of AI and particularly about

170
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,260
 the future of humanity swept up in this kind of formation

171
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,100
 and forming and shaping of what humanity will look like

172
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,180
 in the future because of AI and I think there's a lot

173
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,420
 of things to be excited for with this development of AI

174
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,640
 as well as perhaps some things for us to be cautious about

175
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,540
 but here's one thing I do know, there is one thing

176
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,820
 that no matter how advanced AI may become,

177
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,180
 it will never be able to do and that is to love.

178
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,700
 You see, I'm convinced that love is our unique contribution

179
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,020
 to the world that sets us apart as human beings

180
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,180
 who are made in the image of God.

181
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,100
 Isn't that a beautiful thought?

182
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,980
 That love might be the one thing that sets us apart,

183
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,060
 that love might be the unique thing that has been placed

184
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,100
 inside of us to help us to contribute something

185
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,940
 to this incredible creation that God has made.

186
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,220
 Could it be that love is able to do what no algorithm

187
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,480
 could ever predict or do?

188
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,220
 I've been in those moments, maybe you have too,

189
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,460
 where love immediately shifts a very difficult conversation,

190
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,540
 where love brings new hope into what was thought

191
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,620
 to be a lost cause, where love actually changes

192
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,340
 the dynamics of a relationship in a moment

193
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,020
 or perhaps where love actually bridges the divide

194
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,820
 of hatred or ignorance when we are swept up

195
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,100
 in those moments of love, we know that the world

196
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,060
 can actually change, we know that those moments

197
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,620
 of love shift and change things in a way that,

198
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,020
 like I say, no computer can ever predict or ever do.

199
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,220
 And the reality is also in the reverse.

200
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,220
 You see, strip love from us and we become less than human.

201
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,460
 I would say we become programmable animals

202
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,460
 that are broken and controlled, but place love within us

203
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,340
 and we become the very creatures that we have been created

204
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,340
 to be, human beings filled with vision and imagination

205
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,020
 and passion and creativity and hope.

206
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,300
 And if this is who we've truly been created to be

207
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,220
 and if love is the rawest and most natural form

208
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,280
 of our expression of what it means to be human,

209
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,900
 could it be, therefore, that as the world embraces

210
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,420
 more of an AI future, this is an opportunity

211
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,420
 for the world to actually become more in love with God?

212
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,420
 Because if it is love that is gonna set us aside

213
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,340
 from the computers around us, then maybe we should

214
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,260
 be connecting into the source of that love more than ever.

215
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,200
 The Bible's very clear where that source comes from.

216
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,260
 It says, God is love.

217
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,420
 It doesn't say God does love, it doesn't say God

218
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,820
 has this kind of, you know, sort of program to love things.

219
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,020
 It says the actual very nature and essence

220
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,220
 of who God is is love and because he is love,

221
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,860
 he has first loved us.

222
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,260
 And because he's first loved us, our love then

223
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,860
 is a response to the love that's been placed

224
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,620
 within us from him.

225
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,620
 And if it is love that makes us the most naturally human

226
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,260
 than we can possibly be and if in an AI future

227
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,740
 we wanna retain our humanity, then it follows, does it not,

228
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,580
 that we need to be connecting into the source

229
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,860
 of where that love comes from.

230
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,820
 I'm excited that the future that may well get more AI

231
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
 is an opportunity for the church to rise up and say,

232
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,820
 hey, there's one who is able to give us

233
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,660
 what no computer ever can.

234
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,240
 Love like that remains.

235
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,620
 Which is fascinating because although Paul,

236
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,980
 the apostle Paul, writing to the church in Corinth

237
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,580
 had no idea about AI whatsoever, he saw a church

238
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,420
 that was struggling to truly love.

239
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,620
 In fact, he saw a church that was actually fighting

240
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,580
 each other, a church that was actually treating

241
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,220
 each other incredibly poorly and so he decides

242
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,740
 to write to them in the heart of his letter,

243
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,940
 chapters 12, 13, and 14 of 1 Corinthians

244
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,980
 and talk to them about their attitudes and the behaviors

245
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,340
 and the ways in which they were expressing their humanity

246
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,340
 towards one another and in chapter 12 and 14,

247
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,540
 he talks about some of the ways within their church

248
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,660
 community they were expressing their humanity

249
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,380
 through both their natural gifts and spiritual gifts

250
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,420
 and right in between those two chapters in chapter 13,

251
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,740
 he actually begins to say to them,

252
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,780
 but you need to understand that if you try to express

253
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,180
 your humanity without love, then you're not contributing

254
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,380
 anything to this world, no matter how great your gifts are,

255
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,860
 no matter how amazing the things that you might be doing

256
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,600
 are, if it's without love, it is nothing.

257
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,620
 And as he begins to explain this idea of love,

258
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,580
 he begins to challenge his church in this now

259
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,060
 but not yet time, this time of advent

260
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,500
 in which they're living in.

261
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,820
 And we've been basing our advent series here at the Vine

262
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,780
 over this past month in exactly this passage.

263
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,260
 I wanna read it to you from 1 Corinthians 13

264
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,140
 verses eight onwards.

265
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,060
 We started the series with this.

266
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,660
 I wanna finish the series with this.

267
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,340
 Starting in verse eight, he says this.

268
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,580
 Love never fails, but where there are prophecies,

269
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,740
 they will cease.

270
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,100
 Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.

271
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,540
 Where there is knowledge, it'll pass away.

272
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,500
 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,

273
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,660
 but when perfection comes, talking about the end

274
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,180
 of all things, the imperfect, this now but not yet time,

275
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,320
 disappears.

276
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,260
 When I was a child, I taught like a child,

277
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,020
 I thought like a child, I responded like a child,

278
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,940
 but when I became a man, I put those childish ways

279
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,060
 behind me.

280
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
 You see, he's talking about this now but not yet.

281
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,100
 Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror,

282
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,620
 then we're going to see face to face when Christ returns.

283
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,460
 Now I know in part, he says, but then I shall know fully

284
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,360
 even as right now I'm fully known.

285
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,180
 And now these three things remain right here

286
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,620
 in this now but not yet time.

287
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,220
 Faith, hope, and love.

288
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,620
 But the greatest of these is love.

289
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,060
 I love how Paul is doing this and we've been unpacking this,

290
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,820
 haven't we, over the last couple of weeks here.

291
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,660
 He's talking about this now but not yet time.

292
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,520
 Christ has come in his first advent that we celebrate

293
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,360
 at Christmas.

294
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,300
 Christ is returning at the end of all things

295
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,620
 as a conquering king.

296
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,500
 And he's saying we live in this time where we don't have

297
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,780
 all the knowledge.

298
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,160
 We don't have everything worked out perfectly.

299
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,100
 We're living in a time where yes, Christ has come,

300
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,620
 died for our sins and raised, but we're living in a time

301
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,460
 where sin still has an influence on us and the culmination,

302
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,180
 the fulfillment of the redemptive story of Christ

303
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,620
 will only take place when he returns at the end

304
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,140
 of all things and we live in this longing time,

305
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,900
 this Maranatha, come Lord Jesus time, but he says,

306
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,780
 God has not left us alone in the in between.

307
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,140
 God has given us three things which helps us to navigate

308
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,700
 when we don't have all the answers,

309
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,880
 when we don't have it all worked out, when we are longing

310
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,940
 but we don't see the promises coming through,

311
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,980
 three things, faith, hope, and love.

312
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,500
 And then he says the greatest of these is love.

313
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,620
 Which should raise an important question for you

314
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,220
 when you read this 'cause it should ask or cause you

315
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,540
 to ask the question, why is love the greatest?

316
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,500
 Because I mean, we've seen how important

317
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,580
 over the last couple of weeks faith is,

318
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,980
 how faith is essential to this time

319
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,780
 and without faith we'd be lost.

320
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,460
 We've seen how hope, hope motivates us and draws us out

321
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,740
 and makes us the people that we want to be.

322
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,860
 So we know how important faith and hope is.

323
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,900
 Why is love then the greatest?

324
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,020
 Well, Paul gives a couple of answers.

325
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,220
 His partial answer comes at the start of verse eight.

326
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,460
 Let me read it to you again.

327
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,740
 He says, "Love never fails."

328
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,900
 And another way of saying this,

329
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,220
 actually translating the Greek a little bit better,

330
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,220
 is love never ends or love never ceases.

331
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,860
 Which connects with what Paul's saying here

332
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,020
 'cause he says, look, love never ceases

333
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,340
 but prophecy, that'll cease.

334
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,660
 All this knowledge that we have, yeah, that's gonna cease.

335
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,500
 Even I would argue, Paul would say this,

336
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,140
 faith and hope, that will also cease

337
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,980
 but the one thing that never ends, never ceases

338
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,540
 and therefore never fails is love.

339
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,100
 I mean, think about this for a second, right?

340
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,940
 Faith, faith is given to us.

341
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,820
 We've defined faith a couple of weeks ago

342
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,860
 from Hebrews chapter 11 where it says,

343
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,420
 "Faith is the confidence of what I hope for

344
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,980
 "and the assurance of what is not yet seen."

345
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,740
 So faith is this idea that we have faith

346
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,660
 in order to get us to the point where Christ returns.

347
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,900
 It is the longing for him to come

348
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,300
 and it is the idea that I am assured today

349
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,460
 of what I do not yet see but when Christ comes again,

350
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,900
 as Paul says in these verses,

351
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,180
 he says, "Then we will see face to face."

352
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,980
 So we will see face to face,

353
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,180
 we no longer have to have faith in him

354
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,700
 'cause the fullness of him will be present with us.

355
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,540
 So faith will cease.

356
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,740
 Same with hope.

357
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,880
 See, hope we've defined last week

358
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,460
 as this confident expectation,

359
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,060
 this assurance of what's gonna happen in the future

360
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,500
 because of our deep understanding of the goodness

361
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,260
 and the grace of God today.

362
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,900
 So we are longing for these promises of God to come

363
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,500
 in this here and now but when he does return

364
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,420
 at the end of all things, all promises will be fulfilled.

365
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,460
 All promises will be there.

366
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,860
 There'll be no more death, there'll be no more pain,

367
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,500
 there'll be no more sin or even the possibility of sin.

368
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
 There's only one tree at that end of all things

369
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,940
 other than the two trees that were there in Genesis.

370
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,180
 Everything, all the promises of God

371
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,540
 and the beauty of Shalom will all be ours.

372
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,580
 We won't need to hope anymore

373
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,460
 'cause the fullness of hope will be with us.

374
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,820
 Are you following this?

375
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,820
 But love, he says, is the greatest because love never ends.

376
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,540
 In other words, when Christ comes,

377
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,460
 our relationship will be fullness of love with him

378
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,200
 and with others in that place for all eternity.

379
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,820
 That's the beauty of the Christian story.

380
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,140
 And because that's what we're getting,

381
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,260
 Paul is saying this is the reason why love is the greatest

382
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,820
 because faith and hope, as important as they are right now,

383
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,740
 they get us, if you will, to the place where he returns.

384
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,980
 But when he comes, they're no longer needed,

385
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,220
 but love will endure, love will continue.

386
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,660
 Love will be what we will experience for eternity.

387
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,180
 It's a wonderful thing.

388
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,300
 But I want you to hear something else.

389
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,860
 He's saying love is the greatest,

390
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,060
 not just because it'll be the thing

391
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,620
 that we will have for all eternity.

392
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,540
 It's because we can experience the fullness of it now.

393
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,760
 We don't need to wait until we get there to experience it,

394
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 but it actually can be a part of our human story today.

395
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,080
 Now, to understand what Paul is saying about that,

396
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,660
 we have to actually understand what he means by love

397
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,340
 when he uses the word love

398
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,040
 throughout the chapter 13 here in 1 Corinthians.

399
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,820
 You may know that in the Greek language in the first century

400
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,560
 there were six words in the Greek language

401
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,300
 that we would translate into English as love.

402
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,020
 The two most popular in the first century was eros,

403
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,260
 which is kind of sexual or romantic love,

404
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,940
 and philia, which was like loyal friendship

405
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,580
 and kind of love that is happening

406
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,820
 between two committed friends.

407
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,860
 But there was this other word for love,

408
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,620
 one of the other six words, it's the word agape.

409
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,740
 You probably have heard this

410
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,540
 if you've been a Christian for some time.

411
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,180
 Agape is this idea of a love

412
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,620
 that was defined in the Greek culture

413
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,460
 as radical, sacrificial, selfless love.

414
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,780
 And when the church was thinking,

415
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,420
 what is the word for love from the Greek language

416
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,320
 that we're gonna apply to our relationship with God

417
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,860
 and to who God is, it's this word agape that they chose.

418
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,140
 Now, what's fascinating for us is that we often,

419
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,060
 when we think of agape love, I think in the church today,

420
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,580
 we most genuinely focus on God and God's love for us.

421
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,460
 We think God's love is agape, which is absolutely true.

422
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,140
 But Paul is wanting us to understand

423
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,100
 that it's not just an agape love that comes from him to us,

424
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,640
 but agape should also be the love

425
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,100
 that we give to one another.

426
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,620
 And that, my friends, changes everything.

427
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,460
 And I wanna kind of unpack this by taking you quickly

428
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,620
 just to another passage outside of Paul.

429
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,660
 This is from 1 John, starting in verse four.

430
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,300
 I want you to listen to how the disciple John writes this.

431
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,100
 In verse 10, he says this.

432
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,660
 He says, "This is agape love, not that we loved God,

433
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,820
 "but that he loved us and sent his son

434
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,560
 "as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

435
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,440
 "So dear friends, since God so loved us, agaped us,

436
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,440
 "we ought to now agape one another.

437
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,920
 "No one has ever seen God, but if we love God,

438
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,700
 "sorry, if we love one another, God lives in us

439
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,220
 "and his love is made complete in us."

440
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,420
 I think this is really powerful

441
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,620
 'cause what he's kind of saying here is,

442
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,820
 here's what the ultimate picture of agape is.

443
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,420
 You wanna know what agape is?

444
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,280
 This is what it is.

445
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,280
 It is this unadulterated, selfless, other-centered love.

446
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,420
 See, agape is when we give of ourself completely

447
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,420
 to sacrificing for somebody else's benefit.

448
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,900
 And John goes, "Okay, what's the best picture

449
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,260
 "I can give you to understand what agape is?"

450
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,660
 Oh, I know what it is, it's the cross of Jesus.

451
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,060
 How could it be anything else?

452
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,340
 You wanna see the ultimate picture

453
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,020
 of what agape looks like?

454
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,040
 It's a God who so loved the world

455
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,580
 that he was willing to send his only son

456
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,620
 into the darkness, into the brokenness,

457
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,780
 into the sin, into all the pain,

458
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,100
 come and be born as a helpless, defenseless child,

459
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,360
 grow up around a world tainted so deeply

460
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,860
 and marred so ugly with sin,

461
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,600
 go and be eventually killed on a Roman cross,

462
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,620
 essentially a torture device,

463
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,980
 in order that everyone else who would ever align

464
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,360
 in relationship and belief and faith in him

465
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,740
 would not ever perish to death but know eternal life.

466
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,920
 The writer John is saying, "That's agape.

467
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,160
 "It is completely sacrificial, completely selfless.

468
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,740
 "It is other-sensed love.

469
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,740
 "It's the kind of love that would take an old Spanish nun

470
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,800
 "who has never had a person visit her for weeks,

471
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,780
 "who then shows that person around the church

472
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,460
 "and is having a great time with that person,

473
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,620
 "but when somebody turns up who is more in need,

474
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,740
 "she is willing to let go of that one

475
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,040
 "and run as fast as she can towards the person in need."

476
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,000
 That's agape.

477
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,980
 That's sacrificing everything else

478
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,740
 in order the other would flourish

479
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,220
 as God would desire them to.

480
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,580
 If I was to give you a definition of agape,

481
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,780
 here's how I would straightaway define it.

482
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,300
 Agape love is the overflow of our delight in God

483
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,620
 that joyfully cherishes and seeks

484
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,820
 the best interest of another,

485
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,380
 even when it comes at great sacrifice to ourselves.

486
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,180
 I want you to hear what John says here.

487
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,460
 He says, "Here's the greatest example of agape love.

488
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,960
 "It's the cross, but because we have the cross,

489
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,200
 "because God has loved us like that,

490
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,940
 "we now," he says, "should love one another."

491
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,560
 He doesn't say we now should eros one another

492
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
 or philea one another.

493
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,800
 He says we should agape one another.

494
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,280
 In other words, the sacrifice seen on the cross

495
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,320
 should be the starting point for how we now love each other

496
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,120
 and that if we could love each other in that way,

497
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,240
 we might actually begin to model

498
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
 and shape the future of this world

499
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,260
 to be a place that when Christ returns,

500
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,000
 we would come to see the fullness of that love fulfilled.

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,200
 This, my friends, is what Christmas is all about.

502
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,840
 The love of Christmas is agape love in its fullness.

503
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,680
 It is the decision that God made to give his son.

504
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,860
 And of course, the cross is going to happen later,

505
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,240
 but in that moment in Bethlehem,

506
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,880
 in that moment of calling Mary,

507
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,880
 this sacrificial love comes to us

508
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,520
 so that we would eventually know

509
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,280
 how it is that we should treat one another.

510
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
 Think of it this way.

511
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,120
 Jesus is God's expression of other-centered love,

512
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,640
 which comes at a high cost,

513
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,400
 the highest cost of one who gives up his life,

514
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,180
 gives something so that everyone else might receive.

515
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,720
 That's Christmas.

516
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,520
 That's what we're gonna be celebrating on Wednesday.

517
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,080
 That should be driving everything we think about

518
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,800
 as we go through this season

519
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,600
 that we're celebrating right now,

520
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,760
 that Jesus is this representative of agape love,

521
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,560
 something given so that everybody else can receive.

522
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,160
 And if you look through the Christmas story,

523
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,620
 it's a story of agape love.

524
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,600
 I mean, think about Mary and Joseph

525
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,560
 who had to sacrifice their reputation

526
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,200
 and what everybody else thought of them

527
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,240
 and all the judgment everybody was making

528
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,740
 because they were unmarried and she was pregnant,

529
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,040
 but they were willing to sacrifice it

530
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,880
 in obedience to what God had called them to do, agape.

531
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,560
 Think about the shepherds,

532
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,480
 the shepherds who are called by the angels in the sky

533
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,600
 to leave behind over a year's worth of finances,

534
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,720
 their livelihood in the sheep,

535
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,040
 and leave them to wander off into the wilderness

536
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,160
 so that they could go to Bethlehem and meet the Savior,

537
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,800
 agape love.

538
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,200
 The magi who travel from afar,

539
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,920
 that's not where their love was found.

540
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,560
 Their love was found in the fact

541
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,100
 that they were willing to risk their own lives

542
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,860
 by disobeying what Herod had said

543
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,640
 and said, "Come back and let me know where Jesus is."

544
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,040
 When the magi decided they were not going to return

545
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
 to let Herod know,

546
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,040
 they were putting their lives at central risk, agape love.

547
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,040
 So when we think about Christmas,

548
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,600
 what we should be asking ourselves is,

549
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,880
 are we living this agape love?

550
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,080
 It's a challenging question

551
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,880
 and it's the question you have to have in mind

552
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,480
 when you read 1 Corinthians 13.

553
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,760
 I wanna take you actually to the beginning of the chapter.

554
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,720
 Now that you've got that context in mind,

555
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,360
 now that we understand a little bit more

556
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,280
 of what this love is that we're being called to,

557
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
 now we go back and we actually read

558
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,660
 what Paul is trying to teach to his church

559
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,080
 at the beginning of 1 Corinthians 13.

560
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,160
 And let me say this,

561
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,480
 it is not about marriage or weddings.

562
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,040
 You've heard this a lot of times

563
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,360
 and as I start to read this,

564
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,680
 you're immediately gonna think of a wedding.

565
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,360
 Please do not.

566
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,720
 I want you to stay seated in the bigger picture

567
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
 of what I'm talking about.

568
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,840
 Does that make sense to you?

569
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,160
 Okay, let me read this to you.

570
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,240
 This is 1 Corinthians 13, starting in verse one.

571
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,600
 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels,

572
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
 but have not love,

573
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,080
 I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

574
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,200
 If I have the gift of prophecy

575
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,700
 and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,

576
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,240
 if I have faith that can move mountains,

577
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,360
 but not love, I am nothing.

578
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,840
 If I give all I possess to the poor

579
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,740
 and surrender my body to the flames,

580
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,160
 but have not love, I gain nothing.

581
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,600
 It's fascinating what Paul does here.

582
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,440
 He basically is talking to the Corinth church

583
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,880
 about their natural and spiritual gifts.

584
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
 But I think we can broaden it to us

585
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,360
 to think about humanity and how we express our humanity.

586
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,760
 And he mentions three things in these three verses.

587
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,740
 Then the first verse, he basically says,

588
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,960
 what if somebody was a really good speaker,

589
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,340
 a really good presenter, told a really great story,

590
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,180
 but if they did it without love, it's nothing.

591
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,240
 In the second one, he talks about wisdom and knowledge

592
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,700
 and prophecy and understanding.

593
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,600
 It's like he's saying, hey, if you had someone

594
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,120
 who did a great TED Talk and opened up a new way of thinking,

595
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,040
 gave you data to understand something,

596
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,280
 and you were like blown away by their intellect

597
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,160
 and their wonder and what they thought,

598
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,900
 but if they did that without love, it's nothing.

599
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,120
 Then in the third bucket, he says,

600
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,480
 what about you have someone who looks like they're loving,

601
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,760
 but they're not?

602
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
 In other words, they're giving away.

603
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,800
 They're giving away all their money.

604
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,040
 They're giving away all their time.

605
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,400
 They're loving in what looks like a sacrificial way,

606
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,120
 but they do it without sacrificial love.

607
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,240
 It is nothing.

608
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,720
 Which is Paul saying something

609
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,000
 very challenging to the church.

610
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,680
 He's saying, if you really want to be human,

611
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,440
 if you wanna be the way that God has created you to be,

612
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,160
 you can do all of these things

613
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,120
 that on the surface appear great human things.

614
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,320
 Oh, the artist who tells an amazing story.

615
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,960
 Oh, the incredibly smart person who knows it all.

616
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,520
 Oh, the person who's so generous with everything I have.

617
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
 You can do all of those things,

618
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,720
 but if you do them without love, here's what happens,

619
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,800
 and this is very important.

620
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,400
 He says, you are nothing.

621
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,580
 Notice, he does not say, your gift is nothing.

622
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,600
 He doesn't say, hey, if you do all these great things

623
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,800
 without love, then the gift is worthless

624
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,080
 and nothing will happen.

625
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,280
 No, he says, you're worthless.

626
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,980
 You have gained nothing.

627
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,920
 You are nothing.

628
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,280
 I can get up here, and this challenges me deeply.

629
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,760
 I can get up here and do an amazing sermon

630
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,380
 and wow you with my oratory

631
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,560
 and tell you incredible stories about nuns in Spain.

632
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,000
 I can do all of this, and you can leave here going,

633
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,960
 that was a great message.

634
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,880
 Wow, God spoke to me, and I learned something,

635
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,680
 which can happen, and I can do that without love,

636
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,840
 and you can still go away being blessed,

637
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,620
 but I am nothing.

638
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,360
 This is the danger of what Paul's saying.

639
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,400
 He's saying we can have a world where it appears

640
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,800
 like there's all this great human wisdom,

641
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,400
 all this great human stuff,

642
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,920
 but when it's done without agape,

643
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,840
 when it's done without sacrificial other-centered thinking,

644
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,480
 what it essentially will do is basically try

645
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,280
 to build yourself up rather than build anyone else up.

646
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,200
 See, I can preach the greatest sermon to you,

647
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,280
 but if I don't have love, I'm essentially trying

648
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,640
 to make myself great and not Christ great.

649
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,160
 If I do it without love, I'm not actually thinking

650
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,560
 about you, I'm thinking about me.

651
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,440
 I'm thinking about making sure this is the perfect sermon

652
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,480
 that you're gonna love, and you're gonna go

653
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,520
 and tell all your friends, and more people

654
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,280
 will come to the vine, 'cause that's about me.

655
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,520
 It's about my church.

656
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,280
 It's about this stuff here, and Paul's saying,

657
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,280
 when you do that, you are nothing,

658
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,840
 and Paul's saying, I don't want you to be nothing.

659
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,640
 I want you to be something.

660
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,480
 I want you to be the very person

661
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,400
 that Christ has called you to be, who he's made you to be,

662
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,280
 so he's saying do those things, yes,

663
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,400
 but do them from sacrificial, other-centered love,

664
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,880
 and when you love like that, oh, the world changes,

665
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,520
 he's saying, when you love like that,

666
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,480
 things shift and change, but when you fail

667
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,240
 as a human being to love agape ways,

668
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,240
 you will always end up imaging yourself to the world.

669
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,160
 You will always end up filling the earth with your glory,

670
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,360
 and you will basically fail to become the person

671
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,720
 that you were called to be.

672
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,800
 It's really important that you hear that.

673
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,000
 When we fail to live as human beings

674
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,880
 from a place of agape love, we image ourself to the world,

675
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,840
 we fill the earth with our glory,

676
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,080
 and we fail to become the people

677
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,720
 that we were actually intended to be,

678
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,760
 and when that happens, that breaks the heart of God.

679
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,080
 Agape is this incredible thought

680
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,440
 that actually I was designed to give everything to you

681
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,680
 so that you would be the best that you can be,

682
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,040
 trusting that you're gonna give everything to me

683
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,040
 so that I might become the best that I can be,

684
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,140
 and we do that because God has first loved us.

685
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,080
 We're not trying to love sacrificially

686
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,000
 in our own strength, we're not trying to love one another

687
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,040
 in our niceness and try to be a little bit better humans,

688
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,800
 no, I've received a sacrificial love

689
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,520
 that is founded in the cross of Christ,

690
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,720
 and out of the overflow of gratitude,

691
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,480
 out of the overflow of feeling that love

692
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,440
 and forgiveness of my sins for myself,

693
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,000
 I can now stand before others

694
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,380
 and want the very best for you

695
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,800
 without thinking what's the very best for me.

696
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,280
 This is radical because what Paul's essentially doing here

697
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,800
 is he's turning upside down,

698
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,520
 common thinking about self-help and self-love.

699
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,920
 See, this world is like, hey, you need some more self-love.

700
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,920
 Oh, get on that retreat, get away, prioritize yourself,

701
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,620
 put up more boundaries, make sure you're better,

702
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,360
 make sure that you've got your time,

703
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,160
 make sure you're prioritizing you,

704
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,600
 love your truth, love yourself,

705
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
 and Paul's flipping it all upside down,

706
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,080
 and he's saying you wanna know where self-love is?

707
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,540
 It's found in other-centered love.

708
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,600
 You wanna know how to flourish yourself best?

709
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
 Give yourself away.

710
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,360
 You wanna know how to feel the best

711
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,560
 that you could ever feel?

712
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,160
 Love others like they're the center of your world.

713
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,280
 When you do that, something transcendent happens,

714
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,240
 and you become fully alive.

715
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,080
 When a nun hitches up her habit and runs to a broken man,

716
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,200
 when I go over not understanding a word

717
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,560
 but lay a hand on his shoulder,

718
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,440
 not knowing anything about his story,

719
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,160
 I can feel the most alive that I have felt ever.

720
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,920
 When we truly agape in this world,

721
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,720
 we actually love ourselves,

722
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,440
 which is a very beautiful, complicated,

723
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,880
 incredibly deep theological, but also very practical thing,

724
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,320
 and it's this practical thing that Paul now turns to.

725
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,640
 Let me show you these words that he then speaks of,

726
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,800
 and these are so famous to us, but again,

727
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,440
 try to follow along with this new thinking we have

728
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,240
 about sacrificial love for the other's benefit.

729
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,560
 He says love is patient, love is kind.

730
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,360
 It does not envy, it does not boast,

731
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,000
 it is not proud, it is not rude, it is not self-seeking,

732
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,560
 it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.

733
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,040
 Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.

734
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,440
 It always protects, always trusts,

735
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,720
 always hopes, always perseveres.

736
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,440
 It's really important you understand

737
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,200
 that what Paul's not doing here is trying to define love.

738
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,280
 Remember I said earlier at the start,

739
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,720
 it's hard for us to find the words that define love.

740
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,240
 He's not trying to define love here.

741
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,960
 What he's trying to say is you wanna know

742
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,400
 what a world looks like when people agape one another?

743
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,600
 You wanna know what it feels like for you

744
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,320
 when somebody agapes to you?

745
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,200
 You wanna know what it feels like

746
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,600
 when you're able to give of someone else?

747
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,440
 It feels like this, but also,

748
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,580
 you wanna know what happens when we don't do those things

749
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,560
 from a place of love, when we don't find love

750
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,420
 as the driving factor to the way in which we serve

751
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,920
 and love one another, well, it then feels

752
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,920
 and seems and acts like this.

753
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,720
 So he's not trying to define some dictionary version of love.

754
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,960
 He's trying to paint a picture of how the world might be

755
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,400
 and give us the reason why the world

756
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,840
 isn't always like that.

757
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,880
 So he gives seven descriptors of positive outcomes

758
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,480
 and eight of negative.

759
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,640
 Look at this.

760
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,400
 What love is, patient, kind, truthful,

761
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,680
 protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres.

762
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,160
 What it isn't, envious, boastful, proud, rude,

763
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,680
 self-seeking, angry, shameful, evil.

764
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,320
 What he's essentially saying is this.

765
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,840
 If you do all the great things you can do as a human being,

766
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,720
 whether that's great speaking or great knowledge

767
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,880
 or great generosity, but you do it without love,

768
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,760
 here's what you're putting out in the world.

769
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,880
 You're putting out envious, boastful, proud, rude,

770
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,960
 self-seeking, angry, shameful, and essentially evil.

771
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
 That's what you're shaping in the world.

772
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,160
 But when you love with agape in the way

773
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,320
 that Christ has loved you and demonstrates

774
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,640
 that love on the cross, well, here's what you put out

775
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,480
 in the world.

776
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,320
 You're patient.

777
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,240
 You have long suffering with those that don't always get it

778
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,800
 or kind of annoy you or kind of have hurt you.

779
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,440
 You have this kind, truthfulness to you.

780
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,720
 You protect, you trust, you hope, persevere.

781
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,960
 You wanna do all these things for others in the world.

782
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,800
 And Paul's not saying, hey, don't do these things,

783
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,520
 try and do these things.

784
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,120
 He's not saying, okay, the application of this sermon

785
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,000
 is just to try to be nicer this week, okay?

786
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,200
 If you could try to be nicer, that would go a long way.

787
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,600
 That's not what Paul's trying to say to his church.

788
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,120
 It's not what I'm trying to say to you this morning.

789
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,040
 This is not about finding within yourself more niceness.

790
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,240
 This is about realizing that the love that we receive

791
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,920
 through the Holy Spirit, remember, the fruit

792
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,120
 of the Holy Spirit, first of all, is love.

793
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,360
 The love that we receive through the Holy Spirit,

794
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,280
 which is other-centered and sacrificial to us,

795
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,600
 overflows within us and causes us to want to do anything

796
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,800
 other than these things, causes us to want to serve

797
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,440
 and to love and be kind and be grateful.

798
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,320
 It's not about trying to be nicer

799
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,280
 so I'm on the right side of the equation.

800
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,080
 It's about asking the Holy Spirit to create a fruit

801
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,980
 of agape in me so that when a broken man walks

802
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,240
 into a church, I'm the first one to run rather than the nun.

803
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,960
 Come on, church.

804
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,700
 I got such a thing, she had such a thing in her

805
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,160
 that when he stepped in, she went straight away

806
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,400
 and left me behind.

807
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,240
 It hurt.

808
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,560
 No, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt.

809
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
 [congregation laughing]

810
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,440
 But I could tell the tour was over.

811
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,320
 But why wasn't I the first one to run?

812
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,800
 Like, where is this agape-ness with me?

813
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,440
 When I look at these lists, if I'm honest with you,

814
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,120
 I connect a little bit more on that side.

815
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,960
 I realize that so often, my thinking is so self-centered

816
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,880
 and not other-centered.

817
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,960
 And I realize that if we could flip that around

818
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,080
 and begin to love in the only ways that Christ has loved us,

819
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
 which is always other-centered, never for his gain,

820
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,560
 but for ours, man, could you imagine what the world

821
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,040
 would be like if we could live like that?

822
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,360
 See, it's that kind of love that enables you

823
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,560
 to turn the other cheek.

824
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,600
 It's that kind of love that enables you to embrace an enemy.

825
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,600
 It's that kind of love that causes you to take your cloak off

826
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
 and give it to someone.

827
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,560
 It's that kind of love that actually asks you

828
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,680
 to repent of your sin.

829
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,640
 It's that kind of love that causes you to give to those

830
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,000
 who could never repay you.

831
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,960
 It's that kind of love that causes you to get on your knees

832
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,760
 and to pray for this world.

833
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,360
 It's that kind of love that is other-centered focus

834
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,120
 that changes it all.

835
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,440
 And it's really important that you understand

836
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,800
 that this is not a soft love, no.

837
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,720
 Agape love is not the kind of love that just kind of

838
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,000
 lies down and lets everything walk over it.

839
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
 It's not the kind of love that tolerates everything,

840
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,040
 that kind of allows everything to happen.

841
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,000
 It's not the kind of love that denies yourself nothing.

842
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,440
 No, this kind of love, as Paul describes,

843
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,160
 it rejoices with the truth.

844
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,640
 It does not delight, he says, with evil.

845
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,080
 So this is not a love that just basically says to the church,

846
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,880
 hey, just treat everybody how, you know, whatever,

847
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,680
 and just, you know, everything goes,

848
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,000
 and there's nothing bad in the world,

849
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,400
 and like, don't be mean to, you know,

850
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,600
 well, you shouldn't be mean to anyone, but you know.

851
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,080
 It's the kind of love that's not so soft and whimsical

852
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,520
 that it's like, hey, anything goes,

853
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,440
 just live your life and it's cool, be your truth.

854
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,540
 No, it's the kind of love that rejoices with truth of God,

855
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,660
 that rejoices with scripture and the promises of God,

856
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,440
 that actually understands that and doesn't delight

857
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,040
 in the distortions of those things,

858
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,640
 doesn't delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.

859
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,480
 It's the kind of love that actually causes us to say,

860
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,480
 hey, I love you doesn't mean I accept everything

861
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,120
 that comes out of your mouth, everything that you do.

862
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,560
 My love of you, my agape of you,

863
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,820
 doesn't mean you can just act however you want against me.

864
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,720
 Right?

865
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,340
 It's not like a soft love.

866
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,040
 It is a robust, beautiful, tough, run-through-the-church

867
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,320
 towards the broken kind of love

868
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,840
 that stands for the truth of God's word,

869
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,240
 even when that might come at a cost.

870
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,600
 Oh, a cost.

871
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,960
 Maybe agape love is sown more beautifully in cost

872
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,240
 than in anything else.

873
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,880
 And when we're found in those moments,

874
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,400
 it changes everything for us.

875
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,480
 And I remember the great privilege I had

876
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,040
 of standing next to that man

877
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,160
 as he wept the horror of 20 years

878
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,120
 of being a homicide detective out of himself

879
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,920
 whilst he was being administered to by a nun,

880
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,440
 unadulterated agape love.

881
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,840
 The man just sat there for about half an hour

882
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,280
 after we prayed for him, just on his own,

883
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,760
 just weeping and gently being ministered to.

884
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,240
 The nun took me to the side.

885
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,040
 And as she went to the side, she reached into her habit

886
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,860
 and she pulled out this.

887
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,800
 She pulled out a pendant.

888
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,280
 This is the exact pendant that she pulled out.

889
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,400
 And in Spanish, she explained something about this pendant

890
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,600
 that I will never know.

891
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,800
 (audience laughing)

892
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,480
 But apparently it was very important.

893
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,840
 And she placed it in my hand like this.

894
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,680
 And she clasped her hand over my hand.

895
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,120
 And she said something in Spanish,

896
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,480
 which I assume was, I want you to take this

897
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,080
 to remember this moment of love.

898
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:29,040
 As I left the church, here's what God was saying to me.

899
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,960
 He was saying, Andrew, I've placed pendants of love

900
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,200
 around your neck over the years

901
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,680
 that I'm calling you to take off and give

902
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,520
 to those around you.

903
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,360
 That's agape.

904
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,640
 And as I close our series on Advent,

905
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,800
 and as we prepare our hearts for Christmas on Wednesday,

906
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
 let me ask you the same thing.

907
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,440
 What pendants of love has Christ placed over you

908
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,200
 over the last number of years

909
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
 that you might now be able to remove

910
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,040
 and give outwardly towards the other?

911
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,600
 Do that and the greatest of these remains.

912
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,280
 Can we pray?

913
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,100
 Let's pray.

914
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:12,200
 Father, we are deeply grateful

915
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,400
 that you love with agape love,

916
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,480
 other-centered, sacrificial, loving in its fullness.

917
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,560
 Lord, we recognize that we have distorted such love

918
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,440
 and that it's not just the world that distorts it,

919
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,080
 but the church does at times too.

920
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,920
 And we recognize, Lord, that often we live

921
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,840
 in a lesser vision of love

922
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,880
 and that we act out a lesser vision of love.

923
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,560
 But we recognize that so often we can be selfish,

924
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,880
 self-centered, that even in pretending to be loving,

925
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,080
 we're actually just looking after ourselves.

926
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,520
 Father, I pray for anyone here this morning

927
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,160
 where that might be part of their story,

928
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,720
 that they would have the courage today

929
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,880
 to bring that to you,

930
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,240
 that in your agape love,

931
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,840
 we would, out of your kindness, be led to repentance.

932
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,080
 Lord, I recognize also that there's people in this room

933
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,760
 watching online in our overflow

934
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,320
 who have been hurt by broken love,

935
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,680
 who somebody else's brokenness of love

936
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,040
 has acted upon them in ways that has deeply hurt them.

937
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,440
 Father, I pray for anyone here where that's their story.

938
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,080
 And because of how broken love has impacted them,

939
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,280
 they have been loving brokenly themselves.

940
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,000
 Father, we do know that we are able to love

941
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,040
 because you first loved us.

942
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,480
 And I pray that if there's anyone in this room

943
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,720
 where that's a bit of their journey

944
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,800
 or a bit of their story right now,

945
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,200
 they've been broken and hurt by love

946
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,160
 and they find that they're swept up in that story,

947
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,840
 I wanna pray, Lord, that your Spirit,

948
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,360
 which you have poured out in this time,

949
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,760
 in this now but not yet time

950
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,120
 between your birth and your return,

951
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,320
 I pray that that Spirit and the fruit

952
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,200
 of that Spirit of love, pure, unadulterated,

953
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,000
 agape, sacrificial, selfless, other-scented love

954
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,320
 would fall on them,

955
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:23,040
 would come up and be birthed within them for your glory.

956
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,360
 Lord, I pray for families

957
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,400
 that have been torn apart by broken love.

958
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,720
 Father, I pray for husbands and wives in this room,

959
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,080
 those that are struggling to love,

960
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,120
 those that perhaps loved before

961
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,400
 but find themselves without it in this time,

962
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,280
 marriages that are strained and difficult.

963
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,680
 Lord, we don't downplay that, we don't brush over that.

964
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,360
 And Lord, we recognize that the only thing

965
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,120
 that heals that kind of brokenness

966
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,360
 is the kind of love that is seen on the cross of Christ

967
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,880
 and a love that brings us once again

968
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,280
 to the most natural state of what it is to be human.

969
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,320
 Lord, I pray for marriages in this room

970
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,520
 that you would restore agape love in the name of Jesus.

971
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,920
 Lord, I pray for businesses and families.

972
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,540
 I pray for relationships that have been strained.

973
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,080
 Lord, we pray that we would be able to become a church

974
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,720
 that has received such agape love ourselves

975
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,240
 that we cannot but help to move out in that love

976
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:35,120
 for the glory of Christ, imaging you to the world

977
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,960
 and not ourselves.

978
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,520
 Lord, as we come to celebrate your birth on Wednesday,

979
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,520
 would it be this agapeness that would mark the Vine Church?

980
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,760
 Would it mark us in the days ahead?

981
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,520
 And would it mark us as we enter into 2025

982
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,480
 and all the things that you have for us ahead?

983
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,000
 Would we love in the way that you truly called us to love?

984
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,480
 And we give you glory for this, in Jesus' name.

985
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,080
 Would you stand with me and we're going

986
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,720
 to just respond together in a time of worship.

987
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,300
 (gentle music)
