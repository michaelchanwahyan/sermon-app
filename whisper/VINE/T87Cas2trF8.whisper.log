[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm so grateful that I can be with you here on my final Sunday with you before sabbatical.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.000]   I was supposed to be preaching out of Ephesians today and continuing our series in Ephesians,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.540]   and that was the schedule for this Sunday.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.240]   But over the last few weeks as I've just been processing my heart to get ready to go on
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.120]   the four-month break that I have, I've just felt like a rising sense in me that I have
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.480]   a message that I want to impart into you as a community before I go.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.600]   And it's one that I know that the Holy Spirit is currently imparting into me.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.560]   It's something that I feel like the Spirit of God is shaping in me.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.240]   And while this is not always the case, I've recognized over the last 11 years of leading
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.640]   here that when the Holy Spirit does something for me, he'll often also do it for us as a
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160]   community.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.280]   And so I want to speak a little bit out of what I'm sensing God is calling me into sabbatical
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.280]   four.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.440]   I actually am entering into my sabbatical with a lot of energy.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.560]   I'm not collapsing over the finish line as if I've done this massive marathon and I need
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.960]   someone to kind of pump some sort of energy into me.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.080]   I'm actually going on the sabbatical with a lot of spiritual energy, a lot of leadership
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.680]   energy, a lot of excitement, which is a great thing.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.520]   But I also recognize I'm heading on to sabbatical because there is some healing I need.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.640]   There is some inner healing and restoration that I need for me.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.840]   And I know that in order for me to lead how I sense the Holy Spirit is calling me and
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.560]   wanting me to lead here, I need to make sure I've got regular rhythms in my life, not just
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.520]   sabbatical times, but regular rhythms to get healing from the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.400]   But now in this season of my life, I know I need that healing perhaps now more than
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400]   ever.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.000]   And I feel that cool as I go into sabbatical.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.480]   And I want to share a little bit with you today out of that place because I sense that
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.320]   there is many of us here in this room, in the overflow online right now, who are also
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.360]   in need of what we've really seen Paul teach in the book of Ephesians.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.760]   And that is a journey of inner healing and restoration.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.160]   And it's been amazing over the weeks as we've seen Paul's pastoral heart for his church
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160]   in Ephesus.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.200]   And a few weeks back, we saw that prayer at the end of chapter three, where he says, "My
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.360]   prayer for you is that you would be strengthened with power by the Spirit in your inner being."
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.640]   And it's this pastoral moment where Paul is standing before his church and he's saying,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.280]   "Man, this is my heart.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.040]   My heart is that the Spirit of God would come and do a healing, regenerative, restorative
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.640]   work within you, create power where there is currently weakness."
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.600]   And as I head into my sabbatical, I almost feel like God's got like a little rope around
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.960]   me and he's kind of gently doing this.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.400]   And he's saying, "I need you once again to get strengthened with power by my Spirit in
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.240]   your inner being, because I need to release some things out of you.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.920]   I need to heal and restore some things in you.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.360]   And I feel that call for you here this morning."
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.440]   And so I put aside what I was supposed to be doing and I want to bring a message that
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.520]   hopefully will not only help you to understand what's happening for me, but perhaps more
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.800]   importantly, help you to understand what the Holy Spirit wants to do for you.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.600]   This is a year of intimacy.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.640]   We've said here at the Vine in 2024.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.340]   Intimacy is always not just about coming into closer relationship with Christ or sensing
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.460]   his presence in our lives more.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.040]   Intimacy is always about inner healing and restoration.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.280]   It's always about coming in so that we can be restored to then go out again.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.240]   And I pray that what I share with you today will be a part of that journey in your life.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.960]   A number of months ago, I got a phone call from an old high school friend of mine here
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.560]   in Hong Kong.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.640]   We had been in the same high school year group back in Hong Kong for seven years at South
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.200]   Island School.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.120]   And so we'd kind of grown up together.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.260]   We weren't like the closest of friends in high school, but we were in the same year
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.200]   group and we had both lived in Hong Kong post-graduation.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.500]   And so I had stayed in touch with her here and there and I'd seen her here and there,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.760]   but her calling me out of the blue was a surprise.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.920]   And so of course I answered the phone.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.880]   And as I was talking to her, she explained to me that the reason why she was calling
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.560]   was because her father had just passed away.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.800]   And she wanted to know whether I would be willing to do the funeral, to help with the
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.480]   funeral, which was of course an incredible privilege to be invited into one of my very
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.280]   old school friends' lives in a time of great grief and mourning to help them to walk into
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.840]   this kind of memorial funeral time.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.480]   And I remember though, as we were talking about this, I remember thinking to myself,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.600]   I don't think this family is from a place of faith.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.440]   Not that that would necessarily stop me from wanting to do this, but I was curious as to
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.420]   why she had asked me to do it.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.760]   And so I raised this, that I thought that they were perhaps a family that were not churched
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.540]   or from the faith tradition.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.540]   And she said, "Yeah, absolutely."
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.440]   And she said, "In fact, my father was a staunch atheist, a strong atheist for the majority
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   of his life.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.680]   And one of the things that he loved to do most at the end of his life, in the last few
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.760]   years of his life, is to debate with Christians to prove them that they're stupid in their
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.500]   beliefs.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.040]   And you want me to do the memorial, right?"
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.640]   So this is kind of an interesting context, right?
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.760]   But I sensed her heart.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   She didn't know anybody in church.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.200]   She didn't know really many Christians in her life, but she remembered me that I was
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   a pastor.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.400]   And she gave me a call and said, "Hey, I would love you to do this."
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.280]   And of course, I was like, "Absolutely.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.840]   I would love to serve you and your family at this time of grief."
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   She said, "Great.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.280]   Well, maybe in a couple of weeks' time, we can meet face to face just a few days before
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.320]   the funeral, and we can firm up the rundown and everything like that."
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.400]   And I'm like, "Yep, great."
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:03.000]   So two weeks later, we met here at the Vine, and something absolutely fascinating had occurred
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.560]   between that first phone call and meeting her here in the building.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.400]   Her father had been raised from the dead.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.480]   No, that's a lie.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   I just made that up.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.480]   That didn't happen.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.360]   I just wanted to see how you would react.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   I'm going on sabbatical.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.040]   I can play with you a little bit.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.000]   That's fine.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.040]   But no, but something fascinating had happened.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.880]   So in that two weeks between when I had first spoken to her and we met, she'd been going
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.440]   through her father's possessions, and she had discovered in the possessions a handwritten
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.440]   note.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.120]   And because of the way it was written and the date on the back, she knew that he had
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.040]   written it just a month before he had passed away.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.480]   Now it was rare for him to write anything down, particularly to write a handwritten
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.560]   kind of note like this.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.040]   And when she looked at it, even though she is not from a faith background, she thought
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.480]   that what she was reading was potentially a quote from the Bible.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.840]   And so she showed it to me as we met, and I want to show you a photo of it.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.320]   I took a photo of it here, and it's from 1 Chronicles 4.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.720]   Let me read this to you.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.840]   "Oh, that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory, that your hand would be with
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.540]   me and that you would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain."
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.680]   So I read this note, and although I've been a pastor for many years, and although I would
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.120]   say I probably have an above-average understanding of the Bible and its narrative, I really didn't
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.960]   recognize this prayer.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.720]   I wonder if any of you in the room recognize it.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.720]   If you did, well done.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.880]   I did not.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.720]   So I had actually opened my Bible and go into the Bible, and then I realized, "Ah, this
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.120]   is the famous Prayer of Jabez."
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.200]   Has anyone ever heard of the Prayer of Jabez before?
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.440]   If you're older here, chances are you have, because this little prayer was actually made
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.640]   famous about 24 years ago when Bruce Wilkinson, a pastor, wrote a short little book called
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.960]   The Prayer of Jabez.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.560]   And in the intro of the book, he actually said this.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.380]   He said, "If you pray this prayer once a day for 30 days, then you can expect that God
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.800]   is going to bless you, He's going to enlarge your territory, He's going to enable you to
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.160]   have more influence."
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.320]   And this book sold like wildfire.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.400]   Because let's face it, all of us want that magical prayer, don't we?
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.000]   That one thing that we could pray, if we could pray that 30 days, my whole life would be
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.640]   changed and I would have more influence and more power and more material goods, and God
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   has blessed me.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.720]   And this was the classic kind of name it and claim it book, and it flew off the shelves.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:50.020]   In fact, to this day, it remains one of the only five Christian books that have sold more
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.460]   than 10 million copies in the US alone.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.920]   Go into any church, go into pretty much any Christian bookstore anywhere in the world,
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.680]   you will see a copy of this book, The Prayer of Jabez.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.160]   Now it is possible that my friend's father stumbled across that book in the last month
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.960]   of his life, read it, and decided to hand write out that prayer, but I don't think that's
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960]   what happened.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.920]   In fact, the reason why I don't think that happened is because of the translation in
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.800]   which he writes out this prayer in his own hand.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.840]   It's not the translation that Bruce uses in the book.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.880]   In fact, I think it's much more likely that my friend's father recalled this prayer from
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.720]   an early time in his life.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.040]   He was Dutch and had been raised within the Dutch community before moving to Hong Kong
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.500]   later in his life, so it's possible that he might have heard this in the school or something
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:50.240]   like that, and in his last dying few weeks, recalls the prayer and decides to write it
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.160]   out in hand.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.320]   And as my friend gave me the note, she said, "I would love it if you could speak on this
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.000]   passage at the memorial," and that led me into a time of researching a bit about it,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   looking at the scriptures, understanding the passage, and as I did so, not only did I become
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:16.400]   more profoundly fascinated and honoring of her father, I also realized that God had something
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.800]   deep to say to me.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.000]   And as I open this up for you here today, I wonder, and I hope and pray, that I'll have
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.920]   something deep to say to you too.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.440]   Prayer of Jabez is just two verses in the Bible.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.600]   He's only mentioned in those two verses.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.880]   It's found in the middle of eight chapters of genealogy at the beginning of 1 Chronicles.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.600]   I don't know if you've read 1 Chronicles much lately.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.560]   It's the story, basically, of Israel and their journey up into the Davidic kingdom, and it
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.040]   traces in the first eight chapters this genealogy of all the kings and all the tribes, starting
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:57.160]   with Adam going to Abraham, and then the twelve tribes, and it unpacks all the descendants,
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.440]   the generations, flowing out of the kings of those twelve.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.880]   Now here in chapter four, where these two verses are found, it's actually found in the
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   tribe of Judah.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:14.640]   So Jabez is part of the family of the kings from the tribe of Judah, which tells us something
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:18.800]   straight away, that Jabez was from a privileged background.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.960]   He was a son of one of the kings in the generation in the line of Judah.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.560]   He was probably raised in a place of relative prosperity and wealth.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.000]   And I want to read you the two verses that we have that captures his story.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.560]   This is 1 Chronicles 4, starting in verse 9.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.640]   "Jabez was more honorable than his brothers.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.120]   His mother had named him Jabez, saying, 'I gave birth to him in pain.'
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.800]   Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, 'Oh, that you would bless me and enlarge my territory.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.080]   Let your hand be with me and keep me from harm, so that I will be free from pain.'
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.440]   And God granted his request."
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.080]   Just two verses in the middle of a genealogy.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.680]   If you're anything like me, when you come across the genealogies in the Bible, you're
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680]   like...
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.800]   But right in the middle of that, we see this fascinating story.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.360]   And the first thing we learn is what his mother has gone through and what she does in response.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.680]   Here's the fascinating thing.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.420]   We all respond in challenging ways when we've experienced trauma.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:26.280]   She names her son Jabez, it says here, "For I gave birth to him in pain."
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:33.120]   The name Jabez, literally in the Hebrew, sounds like the Hebrew word for pain.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.200]   His mother, and we don't know the details because we're not given any more details than
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:41.160]   this, but we can assume that her mother had a really bad labor with Jabez.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.600]   So bad that the pain and the time and everything that happened, maybe she even almost died,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   we don't know.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.720]   But there was so much pain that when Jabez was born, and it was her responsibility to
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:13:00.040]   speak a name, to place a name on him, all she could think of out of her trauma was,
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.500]   "This one caused pain."
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.500]   That's what his name means.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.340]   "This one caused pain."
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:16.280]   And so for the rest of Jabez's life, he's named, he's called the one that causes pain.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   Which shouldn't have happened because when you're a part of a royal family, when you're
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.560]   a part of the lineage of the kings, your name that you're given at birth is very important,
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.080]   particularly in Hebrew culture.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.220]   And so probably he should have been named for one of his forefathers.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.780]   Or perhaps he could be named for a village or an area where a great battle or victory
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.660]   happened in the generations of his family.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.360]   Or maybe at the very least, he should have been given a name that would actually help
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.740]   to project this idea of a character or something that God wants to do in his life or something
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.380]   that his parents are longing for.
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:55.540]   Instead, out of this woman's deep pain of childbirth, she places her hand on her son
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.100]   and she says, "This one caused pain."
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.260]   And Jabez for the rest of his life is causer of pain.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:14.600]   The names and the words and the labels placed over us in life hurt us, don't they?
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.760]   We don't know the details here, but we can assume that Jabez grew up in a place of embarrassment
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.300]   and shame because of this name.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:28.400]   Surrounded by brothers who probably had much more regal and better names, he's constantly,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.120]   anytime he's called, anytime somebody says his name, anytime he has to introduce himself,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.200]   "Hi, I'm causer of pain."
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.860]   It's fascinating to me because in the Hebrew understanding of naming something, in the
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:50.500]   Hebrew worldview of the Old Testament, they thought that names had materialism to them.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.580]   In other words, when you put a name on someone, it was like you were actually literally physically
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.360]   placing a mantle on them.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.320]   The word "dabah," which is the Hebrew word for "word," when you speak a word, the word
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.100]   suggests a putting on of, almost like you're putting a cloak on somebody.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.040]   A little bit like how Ezekiel would get a cloak put on him as a prophet.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.080]   When we speak a name in the Old Testament Hebrew understanding, it's a physicality to
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.320]   it, a weight to it.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.960]   This is why in the modern days, you remember if somebody says to you, "Oh man, their words
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   had weight."
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.760]   Remember how we say that?
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:30.280]   That's basically the Old Testament Hebrew understanding of this idea of what naming
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.280]   something is.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.200]   So when his mother does this to him, she knows what she's doing.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.480]   And she's placing upon him, in her mind, a material reality.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.660]   Not just saying something with an arbitrary meaning, she's placing a material reality
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.340]   on them out of the depth of her trauma, she causes trauma.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.300]   She's not the first person to have done it in history.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.740]   She will not be the last.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:16:01.420]   And Jabez now has to walk in the pain of the reality of this name, shaping his identity,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:08.460]   shaping how he introduces himself, and how he now lives out his life.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:16.540]   And you can almost sense that for Jabez, he's rooted now in a story that he does not want,
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.180]   but a story he's not sure how he can get out of.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.420]   I wonder if anyone else feels that way here.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.660]   I wonder if anyone else has ever said something over you, spoken a name over you, labeled
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:35.060]   you in some way that has caused you to live a story you're struggling to get out of.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:44.700]   When I was 14 years old, my chemistry teacher at school told me that I would never amount
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.660]   to anything.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.940]   His actual words were this, "Andrew, you are a failure.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.180]   Keep this up and you'll never amount to anything in life."
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:59.460]   I remember that moment vividly, as if it happened literally just yesterday.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.300]   I remember where I was, I remember the smell of the room, I remember what he was wearing,
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.420]   I remember what I was wearing.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.620]   And although I didn't like this person particularly very much, and he was right, I was failing
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:16.620]   in chemistry, there was something as a 14-year-old that a person in authority said over me, "I
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.540]   will never amount to anything."
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:25.820]   And although, of course, neither of us were Jewish, there was this impact to me.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:33.000]   That phrase, those words went deep into a 14-year-old that was trying to build his identity.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.060]   And I think to begin with, it was at the subconscious level.
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:41.020]   This kind of subconscious level that maybe I'm not going to amount to anything, that
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.680]   maybe my life's not going to mean much.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.940]   And then when I became a young adult and started to work and move into adult life, it wasn't
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.340]   subconscious anymore, it became a conscious reality to me.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.380]   And I have sat under the power of those words for all of my adult life.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.140]   The one thing I have struggled the most with, and I've shared this quite a bit with you
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.940]   as a church over the years, is insecurities.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:09.580]   Insecurities about my self-worth, insecurities about whether I'm achieving anything or doing
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.580]   anything.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.140]   I've struggled a lot in my adult life with imposter syndrome, and I can trace it all
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.680]   back to that moment where he has spoken over me.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.580]   And I've realized over the years that those words have done two things, and I wonder whether
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.660]   this might resonate with some of you who know some words that have been spoken over you.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:34.860]   Those words have crippled me at times, and they have driven me at times.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:41.060]   On the crippled side, those words have sucked confidence out of me, sucked self-belief,
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.300]   and I've struggled with self-doubt for so much of my life.
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.020]   In fact, I can't even tell you, Chris was here for the first service, my wife, but I
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:53.020]   can't tell you the number of Sundays where no matter how many people showed up, no matter
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.260]   how buzzing the worship was, no matter how perhaps impactful maybe the word was, I get
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:03.580]   home and I crawl up onto the couch and I feel terrible.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.140]   I feel like nothing really happened.
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.140]   Nobody really responded.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.340]   It wasn't that great of a Sunday.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.180]   Oh, why do I even bother doing this?
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.540]   It's like I'm pushing water uphill, I'm not achieving it, and I'll spiral because I'm
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:20.420]   tired and I'm worn out, and I'm entering into some of those deeper places that I have where
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.300]   there's a brokenness within me because somebody said at the age of 14, "You're never going
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.740]   to amount to anything," and that has so crippled me that even to this day, I still have days,
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:35.000]   it's not every day, okay, but some days where I feel stripped and drained of the confidence
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.040]   that I should have as a son of Christ.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.000]   On other days, those words have driven me.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.980]   They've gotten inside of me and they've made me want to push even harder to prove that
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.660]   those words are wrong.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.020]   And out of the exhaustion of performance and perfectionism, I've tried to create something
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.060]   that perhaps wasn't there, and I've tried to work really hard because I'm trying to
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.820]   prove first of all to God, then to myself, then to my family, and then to you all that
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.180]   actually I have achieved something with my life.
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.560]   I'm turning 50 next year, and if you're over the age of 50 right here, you can close your
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.120]   ears right now, but that's really old.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.080]   And I feel really old.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.840]   And I kid you not, I'm having like a midlife crisis, part of the reason why I need to get
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.840]   on sabbatical.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.360]   And I'm having a midlife crisis, this is my midlife crisis.
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.080]   I'm almost dead and I haven't achieved anything.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.740]   And I kind of say it as a joke, but the reality is deep inside, that is partly how I reflect
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.600]   about myself.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:41.560]   I know that I have been weighed down by the materialistic impact of somebody's words.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.680]   And how about for you?
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.040]   What has been spoken over you in your life?
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.560]   Perhaps for some of you, it was by somebody who loves you deeply and meant well for you.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.120]   Maybe a parent who said something maybe out of place of love, but those words, man, were
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.520]   not what you needed to hear.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.480]   And you've carried those words with you and they've shaped and changed you in some way.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.700]   Perhaps like me, it was a teacher, somebody that you looked up to, an authority figure
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.700]   in your life.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.600]   Perhaps it was a pastor, someone like that.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.880]   But somebody has said something and it's changed you and it's hurt you.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.600]   And it's actually over time begun to shape how you think about the world and how you
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.380]   think about yourself.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.000]   And now you feel like you're under the weight of those words and it's really hard for you
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.600]   to break out of the weight of those words.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:37.240]   What names or words do you struggle to be free from?
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.120]   Jabez struggled to be free from the word that had been placed over him.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.360]   But at some point in his life, he decided to draw a line in the sand.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.920]   We don't know when.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.360]   All we get is the naming of him and the impact that had for him.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.640]   And then we get his prayer.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.440]   At some point though, whether it was when he was still young, probably more likely as
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.280]   he got a little bit older, he decided to draw the line in the sand and take action against
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.960]   the thing that had been placed upon him.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.480]   And for him, that action, not to hate his mom and to blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.120]   His action is to go to God and ask for healing.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   It's beautiful.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.240]   This is why it says at the beginning of the passage, he was more honorable than his brothers.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.280]   Because he has a heart inside of him to not try to fix things himself.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:24.760]   He's got a heart inside him to realize the only way I can be lifted from the power that
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   this name is placed upon me is by bringing it to God and getting healing and restoration
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   from him.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:36.280]   He's honorable in his humility to bring action to what has been happening.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.360]   And I want you to see what it says right at the start of verse 10.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.520]   It says, "Jabez cried out."
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.760]   The Hebrew word here for cried out doesn't mean like just praised.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.680]   It means from a place of anguish.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.080]   He kind of speaks loudly before God from a place of pain, basically, which is really
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.840]   ironic because the writer here is trying to help you to see a journey.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.980]   Jabez, the one who is named causer of pain, is in pain himself.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.360]   And his pain is because his mom has caused him pain, which is ironic.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.120]   She said, "You're the causer of pain," but she's the one who ends up causing him pain.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:19.720]   And in that place of great pain, not health, not great, in a place of pain, he then cries
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.720]   out.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   I want you to see how he cries out.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:28.520]   He says, first of all, "Bless me, O that you would bless me and enlarge my territory."
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.600]   Remember the context.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.240]   The context is he's a son of a king.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.880]   He's grown up in the royal household.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.520]   He's had privilege from the very beginning of his life.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.720]   He's not crying out to ask God to bless him materially.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.760]   He's calling out and asking God to meet him in the pain and the brokenness of the label
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.280]   that has been placed upon him.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.960]   And in that, he says, "Would you bless me?"
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.520]   In other words, "Would you turn your face to me?
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.680]   Would your presence be here for me?"
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.040]   This is not a prayer for prosperity.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.520]   It's a prayer for presence.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:06.720]   God, I need you to be with me because I can't do this anymore, and I'm crushed by the weight
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.600]   of the word, the name that has been placed upon me.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.480]   This is why he says, "Enlarge my territory."
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.300]   He's not asking for his kingdom to grow.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.560]   He's not asking that he would have more influence in the world and fight bigger battles and
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.860]   get bigger influence and get that promotion.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.280]   This is not some materialistic desire.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.560]   What he's realizing is because the name has been placed over him that says, "You're a
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.920]   causer of pain," it has shrunk his worldview.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.760]   It has shrunk how he sees himself.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.640]   And he doesn't see himself how he should be seeing himself, and he's seeing much smaller
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   than he should.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.520]   And so he comes to God and says, "Turn your countenance, your presence.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.520]   Bless me."
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.680]   Always about God's presence, primarily in the Old Testament.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:54.240]   "Would you bless me with your presence so that I can have a bigger view of life, a bigger
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.760]   view of myself?
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.480]   Enlarge the territory.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.560]   Enlarge my way of thinking, my spirit, because I have been crushed."
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.640]   And that's what trauma will always do.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.920]   Trauma and names spoken over you will always strip away a big vision and always try to
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.880]   reduce you.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:19.200]   Like for me, I'm never going to amount to anything, so why even bother to try?
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:26.520]   Javis says, "Enlarge my territory because I realize that I have shrunk my identity down
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.640]   to the power of the word that was put over me."
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.760]   Which is why he then says, "May your hand be upon me."
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.800]   In Hebrews, in the present continuous tense, which basically means every single day, now
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.320]   and forevermore, I need your hand to be with me.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.560]   He's asking for the soles of the feet, not just the king, which is to bless me, enlarge
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.560]   my territory.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.680]   He's saying, "I need you to put your hand upon me every day.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.240]   I want you to be alongside of me, walking with me.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.360]   The soles of your feet, if you will," is how Ezekiel would say it.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.040]   "The soles of your feet be with me.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.720]   I need your hand.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.400]   The hand that is powerful, that can fight battles, that can break chains," because
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.080]   Javis realizes there's chains on his heart and he's hurting.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.240]   He's saying, "God, would you break the chain?
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:17.000]   Would your hand every single day help me in my journey?"
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.520]   And then he gets to the crux of his prayer and he prays this.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.800]   He says, "And keep me from harm so that I may be free from pain."
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.400]   This little bit right here, "that I may be free from pain," is what's called by scholars
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.040]   a textual variance in the Hebrew.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.000]   What that means is that there are various different documents where we derive 1 Chronicles
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.700]   from that have words here that are slightly different.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:48.840]   And there are two ways of interpreting, looking at the textual variances, what he's saying
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   here.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.040]   One is the way it's shown in the NIV, that I would be free from pain, which seems a very
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.320]   important thing because he's just told us he's cried out in pain.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.680]   So it makes sense at the end of his prayer he would say, "I want to be free from pain."
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.800]   And I think that's a good prayer.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.880]   But as I've studied this text and as I've looked at the documents by which this is drawing
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.120]   from, I think the way this is captured in other translations is actually closer to what
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.040]   was originally intended in the Hebrew.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.400]   You can see this, for example, in the New King James Version.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.160]   Let me put both side by side.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.840]   So NIV on the left, "so that I will be free from pain."
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.680]   And NKJV interprets this way, "that I may not cause pain."
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.440]   And I want you to absorb in your spirit here what Jabez is doing.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.400]   I think this is much more textually accurate to what I think Jabez actually prayed.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.180]   And as it comes out in the Hebrew, he's not saying that I would be free from pain.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.640]   He was saying, "so that I don't cause pain anymore."
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.840]   What he's saying is, "I don't want to be the name anymore.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:52.280]   If my name is causer of pain, here is my prayer, that I would not live up to the label that's
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.240]   been placed on me.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.160]   That I need your freedom to bring me out from the label that has been put on me.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.800]   I will not be my name.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.200]   And I need you every single day to bless me, bring your presence towards me.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.680]   I need you to enlarge how I see myself because I'm not seeing myself properly right now.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.920]   And I need you so that I would not cause pain.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.320]   So I'm not going to take the name that has been put on me and allow that to shape who
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   I am.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.160]   No, Lord, I'm going to speak in the opposite spirit in this prayer.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.040]   And I'm going to ask you, Lord, release me, release me, release me.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.360]   That I would no longer, my narrative and my story would not be to cause pain.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:35.600]   My name may stay, remained Jabez, but my narrative will not be linked to my name.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:43.320]   That I may be free from pain, yes, but that I may not cause the pain of others.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:51.120]   I will not be the label my mother put on me.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.520]   Let me paraphrase how I think he's expressing the prayer.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.840]   My mother named me as one who causes pain and I have carried this label around with
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.720]   me my whole life, but no more.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   God come and bless me.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.920]   Help me to enlarge the territory of my identity so I do not live out the very name that was
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.920]   placed upon me.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.760]   I don't want to be what my name suggests.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:14.600]   No, Lord, bless me, change me so that I would not cause pain.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.860]   This is not a prayer for prosperity.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.220]   This is a prayer for inner healing.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.800]   This is a prayer for freedom from the name that was placed upon him.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.680]   That's the prayer of Jabez, my friends.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:37.360]   What fascinates me is that my friend's father, who wrote out this prayer in hand, wrote out
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.560]   what I would consider is the right translation of it.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.560]   Let me show you once again what he wrote at the end, that I may not cause pain.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.440]   It's interesting.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.200]   I was talking to my friend about him and his journey in life and she told me great stories
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.280]   because I was going to have to represent him at the memorial.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   She told me lots of great stories.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.760]   This man had lived an amazing life.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.880]   He was a person who was a large in the life character that really grabbed life by its
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.880]   neck and lived out that idea of better to burn out than fade away.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.360]   He was just full on in his life.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.360]   He was an entrepreneur.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.160]   He actually lived in Hong Kong the majority of his life and he had changed and done a
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.040]   lot of great things for Hong Kong as a city.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.520]   But she also shared stories of some of his challenges and some of the things that he
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.480]   hadn't done well, like all of us here who don't always live the perfect life.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.760]   He had had brokenness in his marriage.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.200]   He had found himself in divorce.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.560]   He had brokenness in his finances and what happened in his finances is that actually
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.200]   ended up causing quite a lot of pain, pain to himself and pain to his family.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.760]   And I think it's so profound that just a few weeks before he passed, he would write out
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.280]   in hand this old prayer that he remembered from when he was a kid and right at the end
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.080]   of it he would say, "So that I may not cause pain."
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.320]   I don't know whether he gave his life to Jesus at the end of his life or not.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.600]   I have no idea of knowing that, but what I do know is that somehow he found comfort in
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:10.080]   an old prayer and he could use it to express something to his daughter who found the note,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.840]   "I never wanted to cause you pain and I'm sorry for anything that I've done that may
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.320]   have caused you pain, that I may not cause pain."
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:25.160]   As I step on the sabbatical tonight, I do so because I'm in need of my version of the
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.480]   prayer of Jabez.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:33.440]   I realize that as a 14-year-old I was spoken over in a way that has impacted my life and
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.120]   my insecurities and how I see myself.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.200]   And it's not the first time that I've recognized this.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.280]   I've had years of therapy and prayer and it's helped hugely.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.940]   I've had so many victories and I know standing before you today I'm way stronger than I ever
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.480]   used to be, but I realize I desire more.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.080]   I realize that there's more freedom I want.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.960]   I realize that I do not want to carry around any more, even just a little bit of what that
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.240]   man said to me when I was 14 years old.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:09.640]   So part of my need for sabbatical is to get away and pray a prayer that ends with that
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:17.120]   I would do what it is that you called me to do and never second guess it.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   That's going to be a journey.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.700]   It's not going to be an easy thing to do and that's what my sabbatical is about.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.560]   How about for you?
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   In this year of intimacy here at The Vine, what an opportunity we have to a journey of
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   inner healing.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:35.280]   And there have been some words and some names that either have been spoken over you, that
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.200]   you know you struggle to be free from, or that, and we felt this at the end of the first
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:47.960]   service, or that you've spoken over yourself, ways that you've come to define yourself or
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:53.720]   maybe out of your own traumas or your own past experiences, and you've labeled yourself
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:58.360]   a certain way that actually Christ looks over you and says, "That's not who I created you
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.160]   to be," or, "That's not who you are.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.680]   There's so much more in you.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.920]   You're not a failure as you are currently defining yourself.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.400]   You're not one who can't be loved as you're currently saying about yourself.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.120]   You're not one who has been rejected or lonely as you think right now about yourself.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.600]   The names we place over ourselves have such also depth to hold us captive."
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   So whether somebody has said something to you or you know you've said something to yourself,
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.960]   either way you know that there's change, you know that there's hurt, you know that there's
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.240]   a need for freedom and healing.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.920]   That's what my sabbatical is going to be about, but I also pray that that's what this is about
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   for you too.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:42.520]   I want to encourage you to just open your heart.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:48.480]   And I thought for some of you here, words spoken over you, and you're like Jabez, you're
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.640]   like, "Enough is enough.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.280]   They've crippled me and they've driven me.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.280]   I'm going to come.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.680]   Lord, would you bless me?
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.040]   Would you enlarge the places that I have made small?
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.920]   Would you be with me every day because I need you every day in this?
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.360]   And would you enable me to walk in the opposite spirit of the name that has been spoken of
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.360]   me?
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.360]   I will not accept it anymore."
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:17.120]   And I pray as you do that, you will see freedom in your life like never before.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.120]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.040]   Maybe we could just close our eyes and bow our heads.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.600]   I want to lead you in a ministry moment here.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:33.240]   If this has been speaking to you and if this resonates with you, in a moment I'm going
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.720]   to invite you just to respond by opening your hands.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.280]   And opening your hands is just a subtle way of coming before the Lord here this morning
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.520]   and saying, "I need this too.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:48.760]   I need my version of the prayer of Jabez.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:54.360]   I need inner healing from some of the things that have been spoken over me and I'm tired.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.320]   I don't want to carry it around with me anymore.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.480]   Or I need freedom from the things that I've been saying about myself.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:06.440]   One of the things that I know in my life, I've been saying I'm old a lot lately.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.440]   And honestly, I felt convicted by the Holy Spirit this morning because in the view of
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.360]   eternity I'm really, really, really, really, really, really young in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.000]   I need to stop cursing myself by saying I'm old.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.880]   And I cut that off right now in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.440]   Forgive me, Lord.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.040]   So Lord, any words that people in this room have spoken over themselves that are not of
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.040]   you, Lord, we want to bring those to you too.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:41.600]   So this is for you, maybe just you can open your hands as you're sat and I want to pray.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.080]   Father, we are very grateful that we have your presence with us.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.040]   We're very grateful that, yeah, through the story of a man who would claim to be an atheist,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:59.120]   we have an entry point into understanding a prayer that perhaps has been misunderstood
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.840]   for too long.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.280]   And Father, I know that there is a lot that the enemy has done over us and over individuals
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.080]   here in this room over years.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.840]   Lord, I know that there are people in this room who have carried and are carrying the
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.560]   wrong identity or the wrong thought about themselves simply because somebody has labeled
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   them.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.360]   And you need to know here this morning, you are not your label.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.200]   I'm going to say that again in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.440]   You are not your label.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.840]   You are not that name.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.240]   You are not that word.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.180]   You are not the label that has been placed upon you.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:37.700]   You are exactly who God says you are.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.880]   And you are alive in Christ.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.840]   And Christ looks at you as a child of His.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.000]   And He says, "You are just as I have created you to be.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.560]   And that there is nothing, nothing that I cannot liberate you from."
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.640]   So Lord, we come to you with our hands open and with the recognition of perhaps for some
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.320]   of us years of hurt and pain.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.360]   Lord, we want to pray first of all for your presence.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   Come Holy Spirit, come.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.480]   I want to pray that that starting of the Jabez prayer would be for each person here.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   Come and bless me.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.520]   Turn your face towards me.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.880]   Maybe that can just be if your hands are open.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.800]   That can be the starting point of this prayer right now.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.840]   Just come before the Holy Spirit and say, "Lord, would you turn your face to me?
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   Would your presence be here?"
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.240]   It's not like you have to convince Him to do that.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.720]   Of course, He's present with you.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.200]   But just in asking Him to bless you, it's an opening of your heart.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.480]   That's the starting point of walking in the opposite spirit.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.040]   "Lord, I ask that you would bless me.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.800]   I believe that I'm a person who deserves your blessing."
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.480]   For some of you, that's a breakthrough right then.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.080]   I just sense that as I'm praying.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.600]   This is a breakthrough right now in the spirit.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.400]   Just you saying, "Lord, bless me," is a massive breakthrough for you because you didn't think
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.480]   you were worthy of His blessings.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.200]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.800]   I want to encourage you for you now.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.960]   As you've asked God to turn His countenance and His presence towards you, here's your
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   next prayer.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.800]   "Lord, enlarge my territory."
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:15.240]   Maybe just bring what it is that you know you're carrying, the smallness perhaps, the
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.600]   shrinking of your identity.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.400]   Yeah, whatever it is that has caused you to think less of yourself.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.920]   Not to have big dreams, but small dreams because you don't think you deserve it or you don't
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.200]   think you're good enough.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.880]   And you've reduced the sphere of your influence.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.020]   I want to pray that you would have the faith and the courage to say, "Lord, would you enlarge
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.020]   my territory?
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.560]   Enlarge my spirit?
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.120]   Enlarge my emotions?
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:48.880]   Enlarge the way that I think about myself?"
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.720]   Then I want you to pray, "Lord, would you be with me every day?
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.280]   Father, not just in this moment where it feels good and safe and right, but Lord, tomorrow
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.160]   morning when I wake up and the kids are crying and I've got to rush to work and it's going
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.440]   to be crazy and I would have forgotten everything that happened on Sunday.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.760]   And Lord, in that moment, would you be with me even more powerfully than you're with me
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.760]   in this moment?
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.280]   Lord, I need you every day.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.200]   I need you to be my strong right arm, my strong and mighty tower.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.600]   Your name, not mine, your name would be my rear guard, my yesterday, today and forever."
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:32.000]   And in that courage that you've already had, here's the final part of the prayer.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.840]   For Jabez, it was, "Man, somebody put a name over me that I'm one who causes pain, so here's
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.840]   my prayer.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.200]   Lord, help me not to cause pain."
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.840]   For you, if somebody has said to you, "You're not good enough," here's your prayer today,
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.640]   "Lord, help me to know that I am good enough."
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:53.920]   Or perhaps even stronger than that, you say, "Lord, I declare that I am good enough."
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.040]   If someone's told you, "You're not lovable," here's your reply, "Lord, I am lovable.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.840]   I am the apple of your eye.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.600]   And I believe I'm worthy of being loved."
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.800]   So whatever is the opposite of whatever that name is that's been placed over you, that's
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:12.240]   your prayer of Jabez, and that's your opportunity to come now, just in the quietness of your
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.360]   heart, go, "Lord, this for me.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.520]   I will not accept what it is that's being said.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.720]   And I move now in the opposite spirit, and I release, Lord.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.240]   And I say the opposite of what has been labeled me.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.600]   I am not my label.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.080]   I am this as a child of God.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.860]   I am this as a child of Christ.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.480]   And Christ has paid the price on the cross for all of the brokenness that I seem to be
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.480]   carrying with me.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   And Lord, would you bring liberation, liberation, Holy Spirit."
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   I was going to invite in a second the worship team just to just lead us, but I want to ask
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.560]   you just to stay in a place of receiving.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   This is for you today.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560]   We're going to have the prayer team.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:14.800]   In fact, maybe I could just invite the prayer team just to be at the front already, our
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   altar call prayer team.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.600]   And I want to encourage you, this is really important for you today.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.400]   Don't leave here today without getting prayer.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.920]   As much as it's been good for us to go through this as a community, but there's some individual
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.480]   things that we would love to pray for you about.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.040]   And there's some of you here where, you know, just having someone come around you, lay their
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:36.280]   hands on you, speak truth into you, both in the upper house and the lower house.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.840]   If you're outside, you can come in in a moment.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.320]   We would love to stand with you and pray for you so the prayer team can be available.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.880]   And in a moment, if you would like prayer, just come forward anytime.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.120]   You don't have to wait until the end of the service.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   Just come forward.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.800]   Even right now, if you want to receive prayer, just start to come forward.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.200]   Someone's going to put their hands on you.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   They're going to pray for you.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.520]   We're going to worship together.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:01.000]   And we're going to believe that Christ is going to continue to set chains free, to restore
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.160]   people's identities, to break off the names and the words and the labels that have been
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   placed on us.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.800]   And we're going to do this in an atmosphere of joy and wonder for a God who loves us so
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   much.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:12.800]   And we thank you for that.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   In Jesus' name.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   Would you stand with me?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.400]   And like I say, if you want prayer, don't be shy.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.400]   Come on, church.
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.040]   We did this a few weeks ago and people came forward for prayer.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.280]   We'd love to invite you to do that.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.000]   Otherwise you can continue just to receive what he has for you as we enter in this time
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   of worship.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
