8
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,420
 This is not a church in the singular,

9
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,080
 on its own and distinct, but a church in the plural,

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,320
 united across a nation, joined in purpose,

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,040
 focused on building up God's kingdom, one life at a time.

12
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,600
 It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA,

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,140
 the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,

14
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,580
 and that celebrates in the freedom and grace

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,380
 that such a story brings.

16
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,460
 This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,

17
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,200
 but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,660
 desiring for God's kingdom to take root

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,520
 and bear fruit in local soil.

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,780
 A church that sees salvation as holistic,

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,580
 transforming God's people for God's work,

22
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,580
 and equipping a generation to represent God's heart

23
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,420
 to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,300
 Imagine this church committed to seeing the family

25
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,640
 as integral to all that it's called to be and do,

26
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,020
 involving intentional, committed,

27
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,920
 and authentic relationships across all levels.

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,780
 It is the sort of place where both the young

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,220
 and the old feel cared for, supported, and equipped.

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,500
 A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions

31
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,780
 come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic

32
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,460
 that honors and embraces a richness in diversity

33
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,700
 that marks us as the body of Christ.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,260
 It is a church that is willing to innovate

35
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,740
 and express faith creatively,

36
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,980
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity

37
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,340
 as glory to Him.

38
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,660
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

39
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,620
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,540
 of their lives, where they seek to develop

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,220
 an intelligent, spiritual faith,

42
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,640
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,660
 A church that does not make its Sunday services

44
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,980
 the exclamation mark of its existence,

45
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,220
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,

46
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,780
 a time of service, love, and engagement

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,900
 that inspires and emboldens all equally

 for the conversation that lies ahead.

49
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,220
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

50
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,520
 This is our city.

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,860

68
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,700

 Palm Sunday is to remember how Jesus go into Jerusalem

90

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,880
 someone there to shine.

184
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,880
 But God who called me here below

185
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:45,880
 will be forever mine, will be forever mine.

186
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:53,880
 You are forever mine.

187
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,880
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.

188
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,880
 My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.

189
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns,

190
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,880
 unending love, amazing grace.

191
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.

192
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:40,880
 My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.

193
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns,

194
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,880
 unending love, amazing grace.

195
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns,

196
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:08,880
 unending love, amazing grace.

197
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns,

198
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 unending love, amazing grace.

 [PIANO PLAYING]

201
00:17:46,880 --> 00:18:01,880
 I cast my mind to Calvary, where Jesus bled and died for me.

202
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,880
 I see His wounds, His hands, His feet.

203
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 My Savior, all that cursed the tree.

204
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:30,880
 His body bound and drenched, His tears, they lay Him down.

205
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:41,880
 And Joseph's tomb, the entrance sealed by heavy stone.

206
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 Messiah still and all alone.

207
00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:00,880
 Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God.

208
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,880
 Oh, praise His name forevermore.

209
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,880

 He shall return in robes of white.

231

 The blazing sun shall pierce the night.

232
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,880
 And I will rise among the saints.

233
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,880
 My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face.

234
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,880
 And I will rise among the saints.

 We praise Your name because You come.

261
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,880
 Jesus, may You come to us.

262
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,880
 Jesus, Your promise is never-asking.

263
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 Jesus, we thank You for Your coming.

264
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,880
 We thank You for Your grace and Your salvation.

265
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 We thank You for letting us know You are calling us together to praise You.

266
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 When we praise You, You have the glory.

267

 When Your glory comes, we praise You.

268
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
 Lord, we thank You for Your grace.

269
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 When we say Hosanna because we know that You are our Savior and You will die for us.

270
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:54,880
 And now today, You call us together with our voice, with our heart, with our worship.

271
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,880
 We praise You all together in one voice, in one voice because that You give us the Holy Spirit with us.

272
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
 So now today, may You speak to us.

273
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,880
 May You speak telling us how much You love us.

274
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 When we receive Your love, we know how to respond.

275
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 We have that individual salvation but also we as a church, that is Your body.

276
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 We come together.

277
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 You call us church.

278
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,880
 We are Your brother and sister.

279
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 We are the son and daughter of God.

280
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:37,880
 We thank You for giving us this very special, important identity so that we can praise You,

281
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,880
 replace You in the name of Jesus.

282
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
 Amen, amen, amen.

283
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,880
 We give a big hand together to Jesus one more time.

284
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,880
 And also we thank You, our worship team.

285
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 You need us to have a very powerful worship.

286
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
 Thank you so much.

287
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 Thank you so much.

288
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
 So please have a seat.

289
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 Please have a seat.

290
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,880
 Welcome again.

291
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 I'm Ivan, one of the pastors of Divine Yunlong.

292
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
 May I know who is the first time to come?

293
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,880
 If you are first time to join us to come to our Divine Yunlong, may you just wave your hand.

294
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 Wow, hello, welcome.

295
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,880
 That kind of familiar faces, that's first time to join us.

296
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
 So welcome.

297
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,880
 I also recognize many of you.

298
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,880
 Yeah, we know each other for a little while or even maybe some of us, you come at the first time to explore,

299
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,880
 to know this church community.

300
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,880
 I would like to invite you to scan our QR code.

301
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,880
 Some of you may join the WhatsApp group before, but this is a new one because of some technical issue.

302
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 We have the technical issue so that we cannot use the old one anymore.

303
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
 We cannot send message out from that WhatsApp group.

304
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,880
 So I would invite you all to scan again for this WhatsApp channel.

305
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,880
 From this, we will announce regularly on time to time about our church update,

306
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 some church-wide events and some important information for this WhatsApp.

307
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:18,880
 So this has a high privacy so you won't see each other's number, but you will join that community.

308
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 If you are not able to scan it right now, we have two screens, that signature TV, you can scan it after our service.

309
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 Okay, next thing is, I would like to update you a little bit about our kids' arrangement.

310
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,880
 After service, as usual, we will pick up our kids.

311
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,880
 But I want to share one thing.

312
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 Like a few weeks ago, actually that is not the first time, like months ago, also happened once.

313
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 We have a little kid, very cute little kid, went away from this building.

314
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
 Yeah, but God really protect us.

315
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 So no worry, it's all safe.

316
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,880
 What I want to mention is, during the service, once the service starts, we will close the first door.

317
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 The first door means close to the staircase.

318
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,880
 We will close the door and for the parents, you will have your sticker, right?

319
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
 Register your children.

320
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,880
 So when you send your kids to K4C, that means they are safe.

321
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,880
 Of course, when they are with you, they are also safe.

322
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 But we invite you to keep your eyes on your children.

323
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,880
 So after the service, we have five minutes to pick up your kids.

324
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,880
 After you pick up your kids, you can still enjoy our community time as usual.

325
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,880
 But also peace after then, because the door will open for others to leave the church building.

326
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
 So is this good?

327
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,880
 So why don't we pray for our children so that they will have a high protection, provision, grace and love, all together with our prayer.

328
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 Father, we thank you so much to have these beautiful children with us.

329
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,880
 They are treasure, they are your daughter and sister.

330
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
 They are our family member.

331
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:18,880
 So Lord, may you protect them, may you teach them, grow them, lead them, and also strengthen us as a church, as a community, as a family.

332
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 We can grow them all together, love them all together.

333
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,880
 May you also strengthen our teachers, they can deliver your love and message to these beautiful little children.

334
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,880
 We pray that in the name of Jesus. Amen.

335
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,880
 So now is your time, boys and girls.

336
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,880
 Enjoy your cars.

337
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,880
 So if you are three to five, go to Miss June as well.

338
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
 Six to twelve, also go to Miss June first.

339
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 And then if you are in need, we have a playroom for zero to two years old children with the parents, accompany with them in that playroom.

340
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,880
 We have a live stream for you guys.

341
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:06,880
 So now it is your time to say hi and yeah, to chit-chat a little bit with your fans behind you and then I will come back to have an announcement.

342
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
 Thank you.

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,880
 Baptism, yes, baptism. We will have beach baptism in Gold Coast Beach.

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,880
 So yeah, hallelujah. We will celebrate all together after our English service.

373
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,880
 After English service at 1.15, we have a first coach arrange just leave here.

374
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,880
 Yes, so that's a transportation arrangement, but that need your sign up to reserve a seat for you

375
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,880
 because there's a limited seat, but we can have an other coach if there really have more people would like to join.

376
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,880
 So please sign up as soon as possible so that we can arrange the coach seat for you all. Is it okay?

377
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:13,880
 Yes, okay. And then next thing is after the baptism, we celebrate all together as adults and of course many kids with us.

378
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,880
 So we will celebrate Easter with our kids all together. So we will have Easter Egg Hunt in Gold Coast Beach.

379
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 We have brother and sister already get prepared to celebrate Easter with all the children with you all.

 Yeah, have a fight with the kids, right? As a family together. Gold Coast, very close.

382
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,880
 So our baptism service will start at 2.15 in Gold Coast and then after that we will have Easter Egg Hunt.

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,880
 So please sign up so that we can order more eggs for you guys. Yeah, to make sure kids have enough eggs as well.

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:51,880
 We will set up here right after the English service so that we can enjoy our meal and our fellowship time all together.

391
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 Is it good? Of course, we have coffee right there after the service. Yeah.

392
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:05,880
 Okay. And so now it's offering time. I would like to invite our welcome team to pass around the offering buckets.

393
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 I would like to again to take this opportunity to thank you all for your generosity.

394
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:21,880
 Since March, we have our Vision Sunday. We really can see how we all together as one body to support the vision that God giving us.

395
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,880
 Week by week, we see that how you all pour out your heart, your time and also financially to support church.

396
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,880
 And that is Jesus Church and how we can work together in his kingdom.

397
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:40,880
 So, yeah, we thank you so much for all your willingness and also the commitment to Jesus kingdom.

398
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:50,880
 So let us pray for our offering so that we can have one heart to see how Jesus can really use that to bless the city, to bless the people around us.

399
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,880
 Let us pray. Father, we thank you for your calling. That is the calling for us.

400
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:05,880
 There is a very clear lead leading us guidance for us to contribute to your kingdom.

401
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:13,880
 So long may you use that money. May you use this single contribution into your kingdom.

402
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:23,880
 May your kingdom come. May you also teach us how to use our time, our talent, our energy, whatever you put in our life.

403
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:35,880
 That also the offering you're asking us to give. So long may you use it in your goodness, in your will and also to bless the people in this city, in this season.

404
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,880
 We thank you in the name of Jesus. Everyone says Amen.

405
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:52,880
 So today we have our very beloved brother from Wan Chai. Let us give a hand together to Pastor Justin.

406
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,880
 Yeah, thank you. Every time I see Justin, I don't know why, I just feel a ton of peace.

407
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,880
 I always want to hug you and give you a kiss, but not here because his wife is here today.

408
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,880
 Yeah, somewhere. Yeah, your children. Yeah, children. We love your daddy. Okay.

409
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:18,880
 And yeah, so why don't we pray for Justin altogether for his preaching today.

410
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:27,880
 Father, we thank you for leading Justin to give him voice, to give him ideas, to give him wisdom, to give him strength,

411
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:39,880
 so that today he can deliver your message to us. May you anoint him so that he can fully receive and also pour out the words and your heart to us.

412
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,880
 May you also bless us to open our heart, open our ears to listen to you.

413
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,880
 And then we know how to respond to that words into our life altogether. We pray that in Jesus' name. Amen.

414
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:03,880
 Amen. Thank you, Ivan. Do I, is this here okay? Okay. All right. Good morning.

415
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,880
 My name is Justin, one of the pastors at the Vine Wan Chai, but I've been here a couple of times.

416
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,880
 I was here three weeks ago. My wife Patsy here. We're here together with our children.

417
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,880
 So thank you for having us. Thank you, Tim, for having us.

418
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,880
 Wherever you are, I know you're watching. Just want to say hi to you and Chris and Elle.

419
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,880
 Hopefully you're having a good time. We miss you. And so, yeah, before we start, I would like to pray for us.

420
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,880
 So I'm just going to pray again. Not saying that you're praying.

421
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,880
 But anyways, I just want to pray for us to receive today's words. So would you pray with me?

422
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:45,880
 Lord, we ask you to give us a humble heart, a listening heart, a receptive heart this morning.

423
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,880
 Father, I know all of us are going through different seasons. We're going through different obstacles.

424
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,880
 We're going through different things in our lives. We're holding and juggling different things.

425
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:04,880
 And so, Lord, you know that. And so we just ask you to speak a specific word to each of us here tonight, today, this morning.

426
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,880
 Father, in your name we pray. Amen.

427
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:19,880
 So I found this out this week. My friend told me that Yuen Long used to be and still is a very rich land for farming.

428
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,880
 And I know for those of us who live in Yuen Long, we work in Yuen Long.

429
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,880
 This is a specialty, especially before the 1980s. There were so many plots of vegetable land.

430
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,880
 There were grains of rice. And this rice and the grain would feed Yuen Long, the people of Yuen Long, but also the people of Hong Kong.

431
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:46,880
 And so I bring this up not just as a trivial, interesting fact, but I bring this up because it's profound for us today to worship together,

432
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,880
 knowing that we sit on a historically rich land for farming.

433
00:39:51,880 --> 00:40:00,880
 And today we are going to talk about farming. We're talking about the parable of the sower, the seeds, and the soil.

434
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,880
 And I titled today's message, "A Parable on Grace and Listening."

435
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,880
 So right now, I just want to ask you to read with me. I'm going to read Mark chapter 4, verse 1 to 20.

436
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,880
 So I ask you to follow along with me.

437
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,880
 Verse 1. "Again, Jesus began to teach by the sea.

438
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,880
 And such a very large crowd gathered to him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.

439
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,880
 And the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.

440
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,880
 And he was teaching them many things in parables and was saying to them in his teaching, 'Listen to this.

441
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:47,880
 Behold, the sower went out to sow. As he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up.

442
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:56,880
 Other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of soil.

443
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,880
 And when the sun had risen, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away.

444
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,880
 Other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.

445
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:19,880
 Other seeds fell into the good soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundred times as much.

446
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,880
 And he was saying, 'He who has ears to hear, let him hear.'"

447
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
 Verse 10.

448
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:33,880
 "As soon as Jesus was alone, his followers along with the twelve disciples began asking him about the parables.

449
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:42,880
 And he was saying to them, 'To you has been given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but for those who are outside, everything comes in parables,

450
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:51,880
 so that while seeing, they may see and not perceive, and while hearing, they may hear and not understand.

451
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,880
 Otherwise, they might return, and it would be forgiven them.'"

452
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
 Verse 13.

453
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:04,880
 "And Jesus said to them, 'Do you not understand this parable? How will you understand all the parables?

454
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,880
 The sower sows the word. These are the ones who are beside the road where the word is sown,

455
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,880
 and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which had been sown in them.

456
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,880
 And in a similar way, these are the ones sown with seed on the rocky places,

457
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:31,880
 who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy, and yet they have no firm rooting in themselves, but are only temporary.

458
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,880
 Then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they fall away.'"

459
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
 Verse 18.

460
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,880
 "And others are the ones sown with seed among the thorns.

461
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,880
 These are the ones who have heard the word, but the worries of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth

462
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,880
 and the desires for other things enter and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

463
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:06,880
 And those are the ones sown with seed on the good soil, and they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty, sixty, and a hundred times as much."

464
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:17,880
 So this passage may be familiar to many of us. We've maybe heard it many times, but this morning I ask, no matter how many times you've heard this,

465
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,880
 Jesus begins and ends this parable with a very profound and straightforward command.

466
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:32,880
 He says, "Listen, church, listen to what I have to say. I want you to listen and hear what I'm trying to say to you,

467
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,880
 because I do personally believe there's something inherently important He wants to get us to hear.

468
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:48,880
 But before we jump into today's sermon, I want to ask you, when was the last time you heard Jesus speak to you?

469
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,880
 I want you just to think about the last time. It could have been this morning. It could have been this week.

470
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,880
 It could have been years ago. It could have been... Actually, I don't know.

471
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,880
 And I want you to think, what did it mean to you that Jesus would speak to you?

472
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,880
 The word that you received, what was that like? Where were you?

473
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:19,880
 What place in your life did Jesus speak to you, and you just thought, "Wow"?

474
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,880
 I want you to hold this, because I know the basis of many of our lives.

475
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,880
 We, professionally or personally, we do a lot of listening. And I think a lot of us, naturally,

476
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:37,880
 we listen when we find something important or something that's worth listening to.

477
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:45,880
 And, you know, as I was thinking about this for myself, I remember one time, I think I heard God.

478
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,880
 It sounded like God, certainly. It matched with Scripture.

479
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,880
 My friends and family also said, "Yeah, this is perhaps God."

480
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,880
 And I decided that, you know what, I'm going to listen to this. I'm going to lean in. I'm going to respond.

481
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,880
 I'm just going to live this out. And here I am, 14 years later, as a pastor at The Vine.

482
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,880
 And that was a time when, in faith, it could have been God. Maybe it wasn't God. I don't know.

483
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,880
 But I trusted it was God. Now, this morning, I'm saying,

484
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,880
 I really actually believe that every opportunity we have to listen can change our life.

485
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:29,880
 Maybe not in such a radical way that I'm talking about, but every word has the potential to change the course of our heart.

486
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:35,880
 So that's why today I want you to listen. And I chose today's passage for a very specific reason,

487
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,880
 because this passage calls us to seriously reflect on our state of listening.

488
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,880
 Are we good listeners? Because I think a lot of times I'm a terrible listener. I'm a bad listener.

489
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:58,880
 But I know I can also be a better listener. And so in this parable, listening is equated to receptivity to God's Word.

490
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:06,880
 It's being able to take God's Word, to take it seriously, and to contemplate what is God saying to us.

491
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:16,880
 And so this parable, therefore, calls us to reflect this morning on our ability to listen to God in a way that builds our intimacy with God.

492
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,880
 Because I know this is our theme this year across the two Vine churches.

493
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,880
 And so I want us to reflect on our state of listening, how we listen to God this morning.

494
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,880
 So I'm going to break it down this morning. I'm going to give you some context for this passage.

495
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,880
 I'm going to go into detail about what this passage is talking about, what Jesus is talking about.

496
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,880
 And I want to end this message to share on, for us to reflect on God's grace for us. Is that okay?

497
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:52,880
 All right. So some context for this passage. In verse 1 to 2, Jesus, as we read, is already in a boat by the shore.

498
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:02,880
 He's teaching a large crowd about God's kingdom and everything about God and who He is and the mysteries of God's kingdom.

499
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:10,880
 In verses 3 to 9, Jesus tells us this parable about a farmer sowing seeds and what happens to these seeds.

500
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:21,880
 In verse 13 to 20, Jesus privately explains this parable to His disciples and other people that were around listening.

501
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:30,880
 And so the imagery of this parable of a farmer sowing seeds would have been very familiar to first century Christians,

502
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,880
 especially the farmers that were in the crowd listening to Jesus.

503
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:42,880
 They would have understood just the whole process of what it meant to sow seeds and to the hard work that took to protecting the seed,

504
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,880
 making sure the seed germinates, watering, protecting the crops from the elements,

505
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:55,880
 and making sure that at the end of the season that there would be yield, there would be a harvest.

506
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,880
 And it was – I can't even imagine being a farmer, but here we are.

507
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,880
 And so there's a few characters, main characters in this parable, and it is the sower, the seeds, and the soil.

508
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,880
 So the sower, of course, is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

509
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:20,880
 Or the sower could be any Christian that preaches God's Word concerning Jesus and God's kingdom.

510
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,880
 The seeds in this parable, the second character, is God's Word or the gospel about Jesus.

511
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:39,880
 And lastly, the soil, I thought long and hard about this, but the soil, I think today, I want us to think about it as conditions for bad listening and for good listening.

512
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,880
 So that's what the soil represents, conditions for bad and good listening.

513
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:52,880
 Now, they are – I don't think they're permanent states, but I think they're situations and seasons that we find ourselves in,

514
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:01,880
 and we can easily move from a season of bad listening to a season of, "Oh, I can hear something. I can perceive something."

515
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:09,880
 Church, at the heart of what Jesus is teaching about today in this parable sits a discipleship issue.

516
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,880
 Discipleship is a fancy word for our journey with Jesus.

517
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,880
 Discipleship is a process where day in, day out, we learn to pray, we learn to be with God, we learn to worship together,

518
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:31,880
 we learn to wrestle with God's Word, and we learn to grow in the midst of troubles, persecutions, afflictions, heartaches, suffering.

519
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:42,880
 And so what Jesus is teaching us today is what happens when we follow him and the process of how we can grow as disciples.

520
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:53,880
 Jesus wants us to know, and I want you to know, that being his disciples is extremely difficult, and I think you already know that.

521
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:03,880
 It is challenging. It is difficult. Why? Because we will always encounter barriers and obstacles that prevent us from being with him.

522
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:11,880
 And as Christians, as I said, we will go through seasons where we grow, we flourish, we just are so excited.

523
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,880
 We wake up and we want to be in God's Word. We want to talk about God's Word.

524
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,880
 But at the same time, we also go in seasons where it is so difficult to hear God's Word.

525
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,880
 It is difficult because I do not want to hear God's Word.

526
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,880
 It is difficult for the circumstances and the obstacles that we are going through,

527
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:38,880
 but sometimes we are unable to grow, we are unable to hear God's Word, is what this parable wants to teach us about.

528
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:46,880
 And the last thing I want to say about context is that I think today it is helpful for us to think about our Christian growth,

529
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,880
 our discipleship process that is dependent on two things.

530
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,880
 One, our growth is dependent on the sower. It is dependent on God's grace.

531
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,880
 It is God's grace and his sovereignty and his love for us and the church that we grow.

532
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,880
 And the second thing, we grow because of our own effort, our willingness to hear God's Word,

533
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:18,880
 our willingness to really trust that the living God wants to speak to me, wants to speak to us today.

534
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,880
 And so it is healthy to think about both as we listen to this parable.

535
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:30,880
 Okay, are you guys ready? We are going to go into detail on what this parable is speaking about.

536
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,880
 So in this parable, this farmer, he is sowing four batches of seed into the ground.

537
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:45,880
 And each batch, it is actually the same seed, it falls on four different types of soil conditions.

538
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:51,880
 And so right now I want to explain to you what each soil condition represents according to this passage.

539
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,880
 And I also want to speak about what obstacles and barriers each batch of seed represents

540
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,880
 and what happens as a result. Okay?

541
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,880
 So the first soil condition is those seeds that fall along the path.

542
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,880
 And so in verse 3 and 4, the seeds fall beside the path where the birds come in

543
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,880
 and immediately they eat up all the seeds.

544
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,880
 And in verse 15, Jesus, when explaining to his disciples, he says that when the Word is preached and heard,

545
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:31,880
 Satan immediately comes in and takes away what was sown so that there is no chance for the seed to germinate.

546
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:41,880
 So the first obstacle is in fact Satan, who is aggressive and who is so hostile to any potential disciple to--

547
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,880
 basically Satan does not want anyone to hear God's Word, so therefore he comes and plucks away God's Word.

548
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,880
 And so while we should not cower and live in fear, I think it's wise and prudent though to remember that yes,

549
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:02,880
 there are forces of evil that are against us, that resist God's Word, that resist us from hearing God's Word.

550
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,880
 And this is a reality that we live in.

551
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,880
 And I don't know about you, but this happens to me all the time, you know?

552
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:17,880
 Every time we hear an encouragement, something amazing happens in our hearts that we attribute to God,

553
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,880
 then immediately Satan comes in and whispers something and we're reminded of a fear.

554
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,880
 We start doubting, "Is this really God? Maybe it's not even God."

555
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,880
 You know, every week when I'm servicely-- when I'm with you guys, this happens.

556
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:39,880
 And I think really we just have to remember that not to be scared, but to know that at times Satan does--

557
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:45,880
 it directly wants to take away and steal away what God is wanting to give us.

558
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,880
 So the second soil condition is the rocky road.

559
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:55,880
 So in this soil condition in verses 5 to 6, after scattering the seed, the seeds immediately spring up

560
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,880
 because it says in Scripture that they have no depth in the soil.

561
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:08,880
 And when the scorching sun comes up, this little seed that sprouted, it withers because it had no rooting.

562
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,880
 It had no deep rooting in the soil.

563
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,880
 And when Jesus was explaining this to his disciples in verse 16 and 17, Jesus says,

564
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,880
 "These are the people who hear God's Word and immediately they receive it with joy."

565
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,880
 They are so excited that God is speaking to them.

566
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:33,880
 But their joy is short-lived because when the sun comes up, when persecution comes,

567
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,880
 when trouble comes on account of the Word, these listeners fall away.

568
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,880
 So the second obstacle is trouble. It's suffering. It's hard times. It's persecution.

569
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,880
 And it's going through these that causes disciples to fall away.

570
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,880
 Now, I want to explain falling away.

571
00:54:52,880 --> 00:55:00,880
 Once again, it's not a permanent state, but falling away, I think, describes an inability to follow Christ in that moment.

572
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,880
 And so we all encounter these moments where we're unable--

573
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:13,880
 we are unable to sustain a closeness, an intimacy with God, and that's what this soil represents.

574
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,880
 And once again, I want to remind us this is normal. This is not an abnormal--

575
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:26,880
 like this only happens to 10 or 5% of us. This is a fact of our daily lives.

576
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,880
 And historically, this was a very common problem, a common reality for the early church

577
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:40,880
 because being persecuted was synonymous with being a Christian back in the first century.

578
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,880
 You know, a lot of Christians, they remained faithful to God even unto death, and we called them martyrs.

579
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,880
 They were willing to die for their faith.

580
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,880
 Now, of course, there were many that stumbled and fell away, and we don't actually get to hear about their accounts.

581
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,880
 And we do remember Peter, right, in the Gospels, and he vowed vigorously that,

582
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,880
 "Lord, I will never deny you," and remember what happens.

583
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,880
 In his humanness, in the light of persecution, he was scared and he fled.

584
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,880
 Now, of course, when we read the whole Gospel, we realize that Peter grew from that,

585
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:22,880
 and he became one of the greatest disciples, and, you know, it says that the church was built upon him.

586
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,880
 And so maybe not every one of us would struggle or have struggled to a point of death,

587
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,880
 but some of us I know have been persecuted.

588
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,880
 A lot of us have been persecuted because of our faith,

589
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,880
 our family members not agreeing with this lifestyle choice that we made.

590
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,880
 And I know, actually, I've heard of some of you who work in very aggressive work environments

591
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:52,880
 where being a Christian is actually frowned upon, but yet somehow you persevered, somehow you remained faithful.

592
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,880
 And, you know, for us in Hong Kong, I don't know what the future brings.

593
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,880
 None of us do. I don't know how religious freedom is in the future,

594
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,880
 but I think listening has an impact today.

595
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,880
 Our listening today in God's Word has an impact in how we respond tomorrow.

596
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,880
 So, so far, I just want to recap in these first two soil conditions

597
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:22,880
 that the ability to retain Jesus' Word meaningfully in these first two soil conditions is temporal

598
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,880
 because, one, the seed never had space to grow,

599
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:33,880
 and also these two soil conditions, they prevent good listening.

600
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,880
 Now I want to talk about the third soil conditions, which is the thorns.

601
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,880
 So in verse 7, "When the seeds fell among the thorns,

602
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,880
 the thorns immediately came up and choked it and suffocated the seed so that no crop could grow,

603
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,880
 so that seed could not germinate.

604
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:56,880
 And when explaining to his disciples, Jesus said that these are those who heard the Word,

605
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:04,880
 but the cares of the world, the worries, the temptation of wealth,

606
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,880
 and the desire for other things prevented the Word, God's Word, from bearing any fruit."

607
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,880
 And so the third obstacles, we're talking about the worries that we have,

608
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:19,880
 the temptation of wealth, or even affluence.

609
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:27,880
 And these desires, they distract us, they entice us, they seduce us away from the path with Christ.

610
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:34,880
 And so the seeds never germinate or grow because we put our resources on all these other things

611
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,880
 and not on protecting God's Word, so allowing it to grow.

612
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,880
 And I hate to mention this this morning, but I have to.

613
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:48,880
 You know, the things that we're talking about here is maybe our mobile devices, right?

614
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,880
 It's maybe Netflix. It is, you know.

615
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,880
 Some of us, even for good intentions, you know, I overwork all the time, and that's a struggle,

616
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,880
 but yet it pulls me away from God.

617
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,880
 I'm two months to finishing my three-year master's right now,

618
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,880
 but the cost of the last three years has been immense in terms of time away from family,

619
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,880
 time away from God, and I feel it.

620
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,880
 And so there is a cost to our discipleship, and Mark actually highlights,

621
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,880
 and I want you to remember this and think about this in your life,

622
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:33,880
 that greed and affluence and having enough or wanting more will hinder and affect God's work in us.

623
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,880
 In Mark 10, verse 21, you remember this, there's a rich man.

624
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,880
 He turns away from Jesus' call because he had too much wealth,

625
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,880
 and he didn't want to give up the system in which he exploited the poor.

626
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:54,880
 And then there was Judas who betrayed his own master, Jesus, for a small, small amount of money.

627
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,880
 And so this morning, I think God would want us to soberly reflect

628
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,880
 why it is so difficult for the rich to enter God's kingdom, right?

629
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,880
 Why it is so difficult, and I think we understand.

630
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,880
 And so if I can pull together so far what we've been talking about,

631
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,880
 this morning we're talking about discipleship,

632
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,880
 we're talking about conditions for good listening and bad listening,

633
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,880
 we're talking about the obstacles that will come in our way,

634
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,880
 in all of our ways, and affect and impact our faith.

635
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,880
 And once again, I want to say that this parable is talking about our spiritual reality.

636
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,880
 This is the tension which all of us will have to learn to navigate,

637
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,880
 and that's why Jesus is saying, "Church, I want you to hear me.

638
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
 I want you to listen to what I'm saying to you."

639
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,880
 And actually, this warning, this parable,

640
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,880
 it speaks so much about the scribes and the Pharisees in the Gospels.

641
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,880
 Imagine how many times they heard Jesus preach.

642
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,880
 Imagine how many times they heard God's word, but yet, what happens?

643
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,880
 Satan comes and steals the word from them, and they stop believing, they cannot believe.

644
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,880
 They vigorously reject the idea that God is Lord,

645
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,880
 so they kind of fall away in their discipleship.

646
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,880
 And of course, ultimately, they fell away from Jesus

647
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,880
 because they did not understand what Jesus was doing.

648
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,880
 That is why they couldn't have a relationship, a discipleship with Him.

649
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,880
 And so I want to say and acknowledge that the tension is real.

650
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,880
 And lastly, I want to talk about the good soil.

651
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,880
 In the fourth soil condition, in verse 8,

652
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,880
 "The grains fall on good soil, and these crops,

653
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,880
 they grew in an abundant harvest of thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold."

654
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,880
 When the early church, when they immediately heard of bearing fruit,

655
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,880
 that these crops bore fruit,

656
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,880
 they would immediately equate this to faithfulness to Christ.

657
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,880
 So what this means for us is that to be faithful to Christ requires time.

658
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,880
 It requires a process for seeds to grow.

659
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,880
 It requires overcoming.

660
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,880
 And in terms of obstacles, the last batch of seeds grew to a harvest

661
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,880
 because these listeners were able to understand God's word.

662
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,880
 They were able to wrestle with God's word.

663
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,880
 They were able to trust that God's word would lead them through

664
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,880
 whatever obstacle and hindrances would come.

665
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:32,880
 And as a result, these seeds, these listeners grew abundantly.

666
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,880
 They grew to a point of surpassing all human understanding.

667
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:43,880
 And so I think to remain in good soil is to humbly allow God to lead us

668
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:46,880
 and to teach us what it means to grow deep roots

669
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,880
 so that we do not lose sight of the new life that Jesus calls each of us into,

670
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,880
 which is God's kingdom.

671
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,880
 And so you can see now that the different soil conditions

672
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,880
 that the first centuries Christians navigated through

673
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,880
 is not so much different than the discipleship reality

674
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,880
 that we live in right now.

675
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,880
 And preparing for this message,

676
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,880
 I reflected on the last 25 years of being a Christian.

677
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,880
 I reflected on the last 14 years of working in a church,

678
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,880
 which I think is one of the hardest places to work.

679
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,880
 I think from experience.

680
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,880
 And so I just want to list out in relation to today's parable

681
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,880
 some of the struggles I've gone through.

682
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,880
 It's going to just come up here.

683
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,880
 And you can go through this list,

684
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,880
 and I am sure you can relate to how and imagine how these things

685
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,880
 can cause us to be distracted, could cause us to stumble,

686
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,880
 can cause us to be enticed away.

687
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,880
 But I just want to speak into a few of these personally.

688
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,880
 In the last 10 years, I think all of us have experienced people leaving Hong Kong,

689
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
 family, friends.

690
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,880
 That's been hard, especially working in a church.

691
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,880
 But add to that, I've experienced a lot of brothers and sisters

692
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
 who walked away from the faith.

693
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,880
 I think they decided that it was just too difficult to sustain discipleship,

694
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,880
 and that is discouraging.

695
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,880
 There are times where I just ask the Lord.

696
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,880
 I would talk to my wife, and maybe I should just do the same.

697
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,880
 It just would be easier.

698
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,880
 Another thing is apathy.

699
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,880
 I think all of us have to be very careful with apathy.

700
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,880
 We get offended. I get offended.

701
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,880
 Something happens, and my heart just gets harder.

702
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:40,880
 It grows harder.

703
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,880
 It's just less receptive to God's Word.

704
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,880
 When Jesus talked about the rich man having the dangers of being wealthy,

705
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,880
 which I think a lot of us are, would say that we are actually rich when we think about it.

706
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,880
 That is distracting.

707
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,880
 That is difficult to navigate.

708
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,880
 How do I be faithful and enjoy the life that we have?

709
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,880
 I struggle with that. I feel bad all the time.

710
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,880
 Then lastly, I don't think I've been persecuted to a point of death,

711
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,880
 but I remember one time I was trying to help this girl escape

712
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,880
 her abusive relationship with her boyfriend.

713
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,880
 We were in Wan Chai in the coffee shop, and the boyfriend, unbeknownst to us, came,

714
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,880
 but he refused to come in the church.

715
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,880
 It's like he couldn't.

716
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,880
 He was just angry. He was powerful. He was strong.

717
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,880
 He just kept on yelling obscenities.

718
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,880
 I just thought that it was an attack.

719
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,880
 It was Satan using the situation.

720
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,880
 That really scared me.

721
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,880
 All that to say, I think looking back, I can attest to the fact that

722
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:53,880
 God's grace has always been in these situations when I was going through it.

723
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,880
 Sometimes I just was not aware, but yet God's grace was there leading.

724
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:05,880
 Yet, I also reflect back on all the effort I had to put in to get out of certain soul conditions,

725
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,880
 certain barriers.

726
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:13,880
 I think to this day, I'm glad that I stand before you, and I still confess Christ.

727
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,880
 I still love Christ.

728
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,880
 My love looks a little different than before, and I'm okay with that,

729
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,880
 but also I still believe that we have so much to do as a church.

730
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:32,880
 I share this because I think one of the most difficult things for us to practice as a Christian

731
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,880
 is the very thing that Jesus is talking about in this parable.

732
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,880
 How many of us hurry from event to event, thing to thing,

733
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,880
 especially for us parents or teachers, and there's just always needy children,

734
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,880
 which is a reality, right?

735
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,880
 But there is just so many things, and how many times do we say, "Hey, Lord,

736
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,880
 I'll come back to you later.

737
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:56,880
 I'll do this later.

738
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,880
 I promise.

739
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,880
 After I do all this, I will come back to you."

740
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,880
 But when you think about it, that's thorns at work, right?

741
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:11,880
 That's thorns at work in our life, and if there's one thing this morning I desperately want to convey

742
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:19,880
 to each of us here, what I want to say is that it is extremely easy and effortless.

743
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,880
 It takes zero effort to stop growing and to walk away from God if we choose that.

744
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:31,880
 It's effortless, and it's very easy to get sidetracked, especially in moments of crisis,

745
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:37,880
 especially when we are persecuted, when we are suffering, when our hearts are broken.

746
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,880
 But I want to remind us once again that even if our hearts are broken,

747
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,880
 even if we are suffering in this moment and we cannot bear it, God is still faithful,

748
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:52,880
 and he's still going to scatter seeds generously until one seed hits the good soil.

749
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:59,880
 It hits our heart, and it grows, and for that, I think it's worth it.

750
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:07,880
 And recently, I think as an encouragement, I was very encouraged that these three, four soil conditions,

751
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:13,880
 it actually represents our universal human Christian experience,

752
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:18,880
 that this doesn't just happen to holy people. It happens to all of us because we are holy.

753
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,880
 We love God, and Satan would do everything to get us off course.

754
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,880
 And so I want to say that no Christian is immune from falling away

755
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,880
 just as no Christian couple is immune from divorce.

756
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,880
 I think Satan will continue to do his work, and we will always have trouble

757
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,880
 once we solve one problem, another problem comes in.

758
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:45,880
 We know that at work, at the home, in our house, I feel like we fix something good.

759
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:52,880
 Oh man, the lights are working again, and then we have another problem.

760
01:08:52,880 --> 01:09:00,880
 So this parable, it's in a bleak and black and white way, it reminds us of two realities.

761
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:09,880
 One, we are either on the way towards Jesus with Jesus, or we are somehow being led away.

762
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,880
 We are somehow struggling. We are somehow caught up in thorns,

763
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,880
 and we are learning to get out of those conditions.

764
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,880
 But I want to comfort you, I'm not going to end this message in gloom and doom.

765
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,880
 I know it is difficult to be a Christian, and I think you know that.

766
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:32,880
 It is difficult, and that's okay. But it's not impossible because of God's grace.

767
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,880
 So I want to now talk about God's grace for us as a church.

768
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,880
 And God's grace in this parable is an invitation for us this morning to reflect

769
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,880
 and to enter a space of deeper reflection through listening.

770
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,880
 To think about God and how we are with Him through a deeper listening.

771
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,880
 But also listening invites us to a place of deeper surrender, to do things differently,

772
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:08,880
 to put away and to learn how to be a better listener.

773
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:16,880
 And I believe by listening we increase our receptivity to hear God's word,

774
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,880
 to understand God's word, so that we can actually ultimately protect God's word growing in our lives.

775
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:33,880
 And so this morning right now to conclude I want to offer us three ways that God's grace is evident in this parable.

776
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:39,880
 And the first way is that God's grace reminds us that the kingdom of God is always at work,

777
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,880
 even when we are not aware.

778
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:50,880
 And this is a hope, this is a promise for us that the sower that is Christ

779
01:10:50,880 --> 01:11:00,880
 will continue to sow seeds and scatter seeds generously until it germinates beyond our wildest imaginations.

780
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:07,880
 And so Mark is reminding his listeners back then that against any setbacks,

781
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,880
 against any principalities, against any obstacles,

782
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,880
 God's kingdom will still advance and God's kingdom will continue to be victorious.

783
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,880
 So for those of us here this morning, we're listening to God's word,

784
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:22,880
 we're learning to listen to God's word, we should continue to do so.

785
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,880
 For those of us who are faithful in preaching God's word,

786
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:31,880
 we continue to share the gospel with our family, with our colleagues, with our friends.

787
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:39,880
 Let us remain steadfast, let us remain faithful because each seed has hope to grow

788
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,880
 and it just has to hit a good soil.

789
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:49,880
 And I think a lot of us are here because God's word hits good soil and we heard God and we're here.

790
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:59,880
 The second thing God's grace reminds us of this morning is God's paradoxical perspective on suffering.

791
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:09,880
 I think only in God's kingdom does hardship, suffering, persecution enables Jesus' community to grow and advance.

792
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,880
 That our discipleship, our journey with Jesus does not diminish,

793
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:22,880
 but it actually yields a harvest if we are willing to harvest that.

794
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,880
 And the harvest here in this parable is really to know Him.

795
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:33,880
 You know, the harvest that triples, that goes 60-folds, 100-folds,

796
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:39,880
 it's the reality that we can know a living God, to know that His word is true, His promises is true.

797
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,880
 That is the harvest that we desire.

798
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:50,880
 And so we are able to overcome barriers and obstacles because we believe that the word of God is true,

799
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,880
 that He is true and that He is faithful to us.

800
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,880
 And the last, I think God's grace reminds us in this parable that each of us have to,

801
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:05,880
 each of us bear the responsibility to stop and to listen.

802
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:11,880
 That each of us have this responsibility to listen to God's word because our very lives,

803
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:17,880
 our very faith depends on understanding what Jesus is saying to us.

804
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,880
 I think there are, as I said, I think there's too many ways for us as Christians to fall away,

805
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:29,880
 for our hearts to feel cold, for us to be distracted and enticed and seduced.

806
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,880
 And so it is our responsibility to figure out whether we want to be in that good soil.

807
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,880
 It's our responsibility to ask God to teach us how do we set deeper roots into the ground

808
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,880
 so that when the sun comes, when persecution comes, we are not blown away easily.

809
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:53,880
 It is our responsibilities to ask our neighbors to help us weed out some of the thorns in our gardens,

810
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,880
 in our lives so that we can stay focused on Jesus.

811
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:03,880
 And so church, I want to just lastly say, let us take seriously this responsibility

812
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:11,880
 so that we can minimize the chances of being uprooted, of being deceived and being enticed away.

813
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,880
 And so this morning, I will really end now.

814
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:22,880
 I want to just ask us how should we respond, how can we respond this morning?

815
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,880
 Thank you, Owen.

816
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,880
 And this morning, really, once again, I'm talking about our discipleship journey,

817
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,880
 our relationship with Jesus.

818
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:40,880
 And I think by learning to listen, we are able to understand the four soil conditions,

819
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,880
 the spiritual tension, the reality that we live out our faith in,

820
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,880
 and that we can hopefully avoid some of the traps and we can continue to just grow

821
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,880
 and to enjoy Jesus and enjoy our worshiping of Jesus together.

822
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:03,880
 And if we do learn to listen, then we can continue to rely on God's Word

823
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:10,880
 and then we are able to retain the vision of what it means to be Christ followers in this world

824
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:18,880
 so that we can allow other people and bring other people to experience this harvest.

825
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:24,880
 And so church, I want to just ask you to really take seriously today

826
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,880
 to take time to stop and pause and to listen to what God might be saying to you this morning.

827
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:37,880
 Because without God's Word, I think we are only followers by name and by association.

828
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,880
 What makes us--I remember what Pastor John was preaching three weeks ago--

829
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,880
 what makes us salt and light is that we understand God's Word.

830
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:51,880
 It's God's Word that brings life to us, and it's our ability to share God's Word with others

831
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,880
 that makes us distinctly different and attractive.

832
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:01,880
 And that is the only really way we can have conversations about God,

833
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,880
 you know, through His Word anyways.

834
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,880
 And so I just want to encourage you.

835
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:12,880
 I know maybe some of us, we feel that we're in unfruitful soil.

836
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,880
 And to you, if that is you, I want to say do not panic.

837
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,880
 Do not be ashamed. Do not be afraid.

838
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,880
 You know, these conditions that we're in, they're not permanent.

839
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,880
 They're seasons. Maybe it's been a very long season for you.

840
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,880
 But I just want to encourage you, and I want to pray for you in a moment

841
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,880
 that we would find our way back to God's soil.

842
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:42,880
 We would just hold on to that seed that God has given you.

843
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,880
 And so I just--last thing I want to say that even if we momentarily walk away from God,

844
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,880
 once again, the faithful sower will continue just to sow his seeds

845
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,880
 until his seeds hit the good soil for us.

846
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:06,880
 And so, Church, can I pray for us? Can I ask you to stand?

847
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,880
 Father, we thank you for your Word.

848
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:24,880
 And Father, we ask that this morning you would give us the courage to continue just to listen.

849
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,880
 And Father, for those of us who are facing some obstacles, we are facing hardship,

850
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,880
 we find it difficult to hear your Word, we feel distracted,

851
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:38,880
 we feel there's too many things going on in our lives.

852
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:46,880
 And Father, I pray for--I pray, Father, that your seed would be attractive,

853
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,880
 your Word in us would lead us out of these moments, Lord God.

854
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,880
 Father, you would teach us how to hear your Word today,

855
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:04,880
 what to do with your Word today, how to make time to just grow the seed, Lord God,

856
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,880
 that you've given us.

857
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:13,880
 And Father, I pray that you give us courage each day to live faithfully to you,

858
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,880
 to follow you, Jesus.

859
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:22,880
 And so, Father, right now we choose to worship you.

860
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,880
 Father, we choose to follow you, and that is our desire.

861
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:35,880
 And Lord, I just want to pray that your Word would be more desirable than the riches of this world.

862
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:41,880
 It would be more desirable, more--

863
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,880
 Lord, it would just--Lord, we would just have--

864
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,880
 Lord, we would just want your Word so badly,

865
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,880
 and that we would just learn to treasure your Word in our life.

866
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,880
 That is what I want to pray for us today.

867
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:02,880
 And so, Jesus, we turn our eyes again to you in worship, in surrender, in reflection.

868
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,880
 So would you lead us in your name we pray, amen.

869
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,880
 Let's worship him together.

870
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:25,880
 [music]

871
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:40,880
 Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.

872
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:56,880
 I once was lost, but now I'm found, was blind but now I see.

873
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:11,880
 With faith I taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.

874
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:25,880
 How precious did that grace appear, the hour I first believed.

875
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:33,880
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.

876
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:40,880
 My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.

877
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:59,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.

878
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:14,880
 The Lord has promised good to me, His words my hope secure.

879
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:27,880
 He will my shield and portion be, as long as life endure.

880
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:34,880
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.

881
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:41,880
 My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.

882
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:55,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.

883
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:02,880
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.

884
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,880
 My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.

885
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:24,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.

886
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:42,880
 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forbear to shine.

887
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:56,880
 But God who called me here below will be forever mine.

888
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:03,880
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.

889
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:10,880
 My God, my Savior, has ransomed me.

890
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:24,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.

891
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:38,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.

892
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:57,880
 And like a flood, His mercy reigns, unending love, amazing grace.

893
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:03,880
 Dear Father, we thank you for your amazing grace.

894
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:12,880
 Dear Father, we thank you that you called us to come to you so that we can become the good soul.

895
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,880
 That's the willingness.

896
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:27,880
 And we thank you that Jesus, you know how the reality, it brings the difficulty for us, but you never forsake us.

897
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:33,880
 So that's not an easy task, because Jesus, you are doing something amazing.

898
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:39,880
 That's not easy, that's difficult, but you said it's done.

899
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,880
 And that is also will be done on us.

900
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,880
 Lord, may you help us this word today we receive and go deeper and deeper into our heart.

901
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:59,880
 To be the good soil, that seed can grow deep and deep with your love and grace into our heart.

902
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,880
 That seed is coming to transform us.

903
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,880
 When we have a posture to really welcome your words and your work, work on us,

904
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:18,880
 you bring the transformation in our life with the grace and love that we receive today, in the coming future, day by day.

905
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,880
 Lord, we thank you for leading us today.

906
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,880
 Thank you for touching us so that we know how to respond to you.

907
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:32,880
 By the reflection, by receiving love, by leaving out that amazing grace in our daily life.

908
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,880
 We pray that in Jesus name, Amen, Amen.

909
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:43,880
 Thank you, Justin, to give us amazing message, good reminder to everyone of us.
