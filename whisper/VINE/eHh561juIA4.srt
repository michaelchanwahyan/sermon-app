1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 Thank you, Ivan.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,920
 Do I-- is this here OK?

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,760
 OK.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,200
 All right, good morning.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,920
 My name is Justin.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,360
 I'm one of the pastors at the Vine Wan Chai,

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,160
 but I've been here a couple of times.

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,280
 I was here three weeks ago.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,840
 My wife Patsy here.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
 We're here together with our children.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,160
 So thank you for having us.

12
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,440
 Thank you, Tim, for having us.

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,160
 Wherever you are, I know you're watching.

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,040
 Just want to say hi to you and Chris and Elle.

15
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,840
 Hopefully, you're having a good time.

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,140
 We miss you.

17
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,440
 And so yeah, before we start, I would like to pray for us.

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,120
 So I'm just going to pray again.

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,880
 Not saying that you're praying.

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,560
 But anyways, I just want to pray for us

21
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,680
 to receive today's word.

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,400
 So would you pray with me?

23
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,880
 Lord, we ask you to give us a humble heart, a listening

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,680
 heart, a receptive heart this morning.

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,760
 Father, I know all of us are going

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,840
 through different seasons.

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,140
 We're going through different obstacles.

28
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,800
 We're going through different things in our lives

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,360
 where holding and juggling different things.

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,120
 And so Lord, you know that.

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,680
 And so we just ask you to speak a specific word to each of us

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,040
 here tonight, today, this morning.

33
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,600
 Father, in your name we pray.

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,720
 Amen.

35
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,320
 So I found this out this week.

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,080
 My friend told me that Yuen Long used to be and still is

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
 a very rich land for farming.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
 And I know for those of us who live in Yuen Long,

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,960
 we work in Yuen Long.

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,120
 This is a specialty, especially before the 1980s.

41
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,600
 There were so many plots of vegetable land.

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
 There were grains of rice.

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,720
 And this rice and the grain would

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,840
 feed Yuen Long, the people of Yuen Long,

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,440
 but also the people of Hong Kong.

46
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,440
 And so I bring this up not just as a trivial, interesting fact,

47
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,600
 but I bring this up because it's profound for us today

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,840
 to worship together knowing that we

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,880
 sit on a historically rich land for farming.

50
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,160
 And today we are going to talk about farming.

51
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,480
 We're talking about the parable of the sower, the seeds,

52
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,000
 and the soil.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,320
 And I titled today's message, A Parable on Grace and Listening.

54
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,040
 So right now, I just want to ask you to read with me.

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,520
 I'm going to read Mark chapter 4, verse 1 to 20.

56
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,080
 So I ask you to follow along with me.

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,960
 Verse 1, "Again, Jesus began to teach by the sea.

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,760
 And such a very large crowd gathered to him

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,400
 that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down.

60
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,640
 And the whole crowd was by the sea on the land.

61
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,400
 And he was teaching the many things in parables

62
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,120
 and was saying to them in his teaching, listen to this.

63
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,200
 Behold, the sower went out to sow.

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,640
 As he was sowing, some seed fell beside the road,

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,160
 and the birds came and ate it up.

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,720
 Other seed fell on the rocky ground

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,760
 where it did not have much soil.

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,120
 And immediately it sprang up because it

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,880
 had no depth of soil.

70
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,640
 And when the sun had risen, it was scorched.

71
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,400
 And because it had no root, it withered away.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
 Other seed fell among the thorns,

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
 and the thorns came up and choked it,

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,560
 and it yielded no crop.

75
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,200
 Other seeds fell into the good soil.

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,320
 And as they grew up and increased,

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,400
 they yielded a crop and produced 30, 60,

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,840
 and 100 times as much.

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
 And he was saying, he who has ears to hear, let him hear.

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,220
 Verse 10.

81
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,400
 As soon as Jesus was alone, his followers,

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
 along with the 12 disciples,

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,720
 began asking him about the parables.

84
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,840
 And he was saying to them, to you has been given

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,040
 the mystery of the kingdom of God.

86
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,060
 But for those who are outside, everything comes in parables.

87
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,600
 So that while seeing, they may see, and not perceive.

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,920
 And while hearing, they may hear and not understand.

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,800
 Otherwise, they might return,

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,360
 and it would be forgiven them.

91
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,560
 Verse 13.

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,400
 And Jesus said to them, do you not understand this parable?

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,160
 How will you understand all the parables?

94
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,200
 The sower sows the word.

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,440
 These are the ones who are beside the road

96
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,800
 where the word is sown.

97
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,500
 And when they hear, immediately Satan comes

98
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,540
 and takes away the word which had been sown in them.

99
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,260
 And in a similar way, these are the ones

100
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,660
 sown with seed on the rocky places,

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,100
 who when they hear the word,

102
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,180
 immediately receive it with joy,

103
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,460
 and yet they have no firm rooting in themselves,

104
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,420
 but are only temporary.

105
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,200
 Then when affliction or persecution occurs

106
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,300
 because of the word, immediately they fall away.

107
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,280
 Verse 18.

108
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,820
 And others are the ones sown with seed among the thorns.

109
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,060
 These are the ones who have heard the word,

110
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,460
 but the worries of the world,

111
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
 and the deceitfulness of wealth,

112
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,300
 and the desires for other things

113
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,400
 enter and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

114
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,900
 And those are the ones sown with seed on the good soil,

115
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,840
 and they hear the word and accept it,

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,040
 and bear fruit 30, 60, and 100 times as much.

117
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,440
 So this passage may be familiar to many of us.

118
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,660
 We've maybe heard it many times,

119
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,460
 but this morning I ask,

120
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,540
 no matter how many times you've heard this,

121
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,700
 Jesus begins and ends this parable

122
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,220
 with a very profound and straightforward command.

123
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,980
 He says, "Listen, church, listen to what I have to say.

124
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,100
 "I want you to listen and hear

125
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,700
 "what I'm trying to say to you."

126
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,740
 Because I do personally believe

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,700
 there's something inherently important

128
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,380
 he wants to get us to hear.

129
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,460
 But before we jump into today's sermon,

130
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,780
 I want to ask you,

131
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,340
 when was the last time you heard Jesus speak to you?

132
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,560
 I want you just to think about the last time.

133
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,900
 It could have been this morning,

134
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,540
 it could have been this week,

135
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,260
 it could have been years ago,

136
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,180
 it could have been, actually, I don't know.

137
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,700
 And I want you to think,

138
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,620
 what did it mean to you that Jesus would speak to you?

139
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,020
 The word that you received, what was that like?

140
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,000
 Where were you?

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,380
 What place in your life did Jesus speak to you

142
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,140
 and you just thought, wow?

143
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,440
 I want you to hold this because I know

144
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,260
 the basis of many of our lives.

145
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,580
 We, professionally or personally,

146
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,780
 we do a lot of listening.

147
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,980
 And I think a lot of us, naturally,

148
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,260
 we listen when we find something important

149
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,620
 or something that's worth listening to.

150
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,500
 And as I was thinking about this for myself,

151
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,980
 I remember one time, I think I heard God.

152
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,740
 It sounded like God, certainly.

153
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,580
 It matched with scripture.

154
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,060
 My friends and family also said,

155
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,380
 yeah, this is perhaps God.

156
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,140
 And I decided that, you know what?

157
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,800
 I'm gonna listen to this, I'm gonna lean in,

158
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,220
 I'm gonna respond.

159
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,620
 I'm just gonna live this out.

160
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,900
 And here I am, 14 years later, as a pastor at the Vine.

161
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,540
 And that was a time when, in faith,

162
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,460
 it could have been God, maybe it wasn't God, I don't know.

163
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,580
 But I trusted it was God.

164
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,200
 Now, this morning, I'm saying,

165
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,660
 I really actually believe that every opportunity

166
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,380
 we have to listen can change our life.

167
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,100
 Maybe not in such a radical way that I'm talking about,

168
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,100
 but every word has the potential

169
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,160
 to change the course of our heart.

170
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
 So that's why today I want you to listen.

171
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,960
 And I chose today's passage for a very specific reason,

172
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,740
 because this passage calls us to seriously reflect

173
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,780
 on our state of listening.

174
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,720
 Are we good listeners?

175
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,520
 'Cause I think a lot of times, I'm a terrible listener.

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,380
 I'm a bad listener.

177
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,860
 But I know I can also be a better listener.

178
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,720
 And so in this parable, listening is equated

179
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,920
 to receptivity to God's word.

180
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,320
 It's being able to take God's word,

181
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,820
 to take it seriously, and to contemplate

182
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,660
 what is God saying to us.

183
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,440
 And so this parable, therefore,

184
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,640
 calls us to reflect this morning

185
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,760
 on our ability to listen to God

186
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,000
 in a way that builds our intimacy with God.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,940
 Because I know this is our theme this year

188
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,360
 across the two Vine churches.

189
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,700
 And so I want us to reflect on our state of listening,

190
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,360
 how we listen to God this morning.

191
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,100
 So I'm gonna break it down this morning.

192
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,360
 I'm gonna give you some context for this passage.

193
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,440
 I'm gonna go into detail about what this passage

194
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,500
 is talking about, what Jesus is talking about.

195
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,240
 And I wanna end this message to share on,

196
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,320
 for us to reflect on God's grace for us.

197
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,160
 Is that okay?

198
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,960
 All right.

199
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,040
 So some context for this passage.

200
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,820
 In verse one to two, Jesus, as we read,

201
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,360
 is already in a boat by the shore.

202
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,960
 He's teaching a large crowd about God's kingdom.

203
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,760
 And everything about God and who he is

204
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,160
 and the mysteries of God's kingdom.

205
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,760
 In verses three to nine, Jesus tells us this parable

206
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,960
 about a farmer sowing seeds and what happens to these seeds.

207
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,960
 In verse 13 to 20, Jesus privately explains this parable

208
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,740
 to his disciples and other people

209
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,480
 that were around listening.

210
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,400
 And so the imagery of this parable

211
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,240
 of a farmer sowing seeds would have been very familiar

212
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,260
 to first century Christians, especially the farmers

213
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,880
 that were in the crowd listening to Jesus.

214
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,140
 They would have understood just the whole process

215
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,540
 of what it meant to sow seeds and to the hard work

216
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,240
 that took to protecting the seed,

217
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,800
 making sure the seed germinates, watering,

218
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
 protecting the crops from the elements

219
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,660
 and making sure that at the end of the season

220
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,720
 that there would be yield, there would be a harvest.

221
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,300
 And it was, I can't even imagine being a farmer,

222
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,400
 but here we are.

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,160
 And so there's a few characters,

224
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,760
 main characters in this parable.

225
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,260
 And it is the sower, the seeds, and the soil.

226
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,200
 So the sower, of course, is the Father,

227
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,180
 the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

228
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,660
 Or the sower could be any Christian

229
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,060
 that preaches God's word concerning Jesus and God's kingdom.

230
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,900
 The seeds in this parable, the second character,

231
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,320
 is God's word or the gospel about Jesus.

232
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,140
 And lastly, the soil.

233
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,900
 I thought long and hard about this,

234
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,600
 but the soil, I think today, I want us to think about it

235
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
 as conditions for bad listening and for good listening.

236
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,160
 So that's what the soil represents,

237
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,020
 conditions for bad and good listening.

238
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,940
 Now, I don't think they're permanent states,

239
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,620
 but I think they're situations and seasons

240
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,160
 that we find ourselves in,

241
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,280
 and we can easily move from a season of bad listening

242
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,720
 to a season of, oh, I can hear something.

243
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,960
 You know, I can perceive something.

244
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,180
 Church, at the heart of what Jesus is teaching about today

245
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,840
 in this parable sits a discipleship issue.

246
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,380
 Discipleship is a fancy word for our journey with Jesus.

247
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,420
 Discipleship is a process where day in, day out,

248
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,780
 we learn to pray, we learn to be with God,

249
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
 we learn to worship together,

250
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,660
 we learn to wrestle with God's word,

251
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,280
 and we learn to grow in the midst of troubles,

252
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,660
 persecutions, afflictions, heartaches, suffering.

253
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,300
 And so what Jesus is teaching us today

254
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,380
 is what happens when we follow him

255
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,800
 and the process of how we can grow as disciples.

256
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,280
 Jesus wants us to know, and I want you to know,

257
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,340
 that being his disciples is extremely difficult,

258
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,740
 and I think you already know that.

259
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,800
 It is challenging, it is difficult.

260
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,640
 Why?

261
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,660
 Because we will always encounter barriers and obstacles

262
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,740
 that prevent us from being with him.

263
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,240
 And as Christians, as I said,

264
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
 we will go through seasons where we grow, we flourish,

265
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,020
 we just are so excited.

266
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,900
 We wake up and we want to be in God's word,

267
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,860
 we want to talk about God's word.

268
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,640
 But at the same time, we also go in seasons

269
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,680
 where it's so difficult to hear God's word.

270
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,760
 It's difficult because I don't want to hear God's word.

271
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,480
 You know, it's difficult for the circumstances

272
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,040
 and the obstacles that we're going through,

273
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,060
 but sometimes we are unable to grow,

274
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,880
 we're unable to hear God's word,

275
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,280
 is what this parable wants to teach us about.

276
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,280
 And the last thing I want to say about context

277
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,300
 is that I think today it's helpful for us

278
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,520
 to think about our Christian growth,

279
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,040
 our discipleship process, that is dependent on two things.

280
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,800
 One, our growth is dependent on the sower.

281
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
 It's dependent on God's grace.

282
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,120
 It's God's grace and his sovereignty and his love for us

283
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,160
 and the church that we grow.

284
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,120
 And the second thing, we grow because of our own effort,

285
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,560
 our willingness to hear God's word,

286
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,280
 our willingness to really trust that the living God

287
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,840
 wants to speak to me and wants to speak to us today.

288
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,160
 And so it's healthy to think about both

289
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,420
 as we listen to this parable.

290
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,640
 Okay, are you guys ready?

291
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,620
 We're gonna go into detail

292
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,200
 on what this parable is speaking about.

293
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,120
 So in this parable, this farmer,

294
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,240
 he is sowing four batches of seed into the ground.

295
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,280
 And each batch, it's actually the same seed.

296
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,280
 It falls on four different types of soil conditions.

297
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,660
 And so right now, I want to explain to you

298
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,780
 what each soil condition represents

299
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,360
 according to this passage.

300
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,400
 And I also want to speak about what obstacles and barriers

301
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,800
 each batch of seed represents

302
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,420
 and what happens as a result, okay?

303
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,280
 So the first soil condition is those seeds

304
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,680
 that fall along the path.

305
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,920
 And so in verse three and four,

306
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,040
 the seeds fall beside the path where the birds come in

307
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,460
 and immediately, they eat up all the seeds.

308
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,000
 And in verse 15, Jesus, when explaining to his disciples,

309
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,560
 he says that when the word is preached and heard,

310
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,360
 Satan immediately comes in and takes away what was sown

311
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,600
 so that there's no chance for the seed to germinate.

312
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,440
 So the first obstacle is, in fact, Satan,

313
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,000
 who's aggressive and who's so hostile

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,880
 to any potential disciple to,

315
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,520
 basically, Satan does not want anyone to hear God's word.

316
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,840
 So therefore, he comes and plucks away God's word.

317
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,080
 And so while we should not cower and live in fear,

318
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,000
 I think it's wise and prudent, though,

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,160
 to remember that, yes, there are forces of evil

320
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,160
 that are against us, that resist God's word,

321
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,660
 that resist us from hearing God's word.

322
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,680
 And this is a reality that we live in.

323
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,040
 And I don't know about you,

324
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,360
 but this happens to me all the time.

325
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,240
 Every time we hear an encouragement,

326
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,440
 something amazing happens in our hearts

327
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,200
 that we attribute to God,

328
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,300
 then immediately, Satan comes in and whispers something,

329
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,280
 and we're reminded of a fear.

330
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,560
 We start doubting, is this really God?

331
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,400
 Maybe it's not even God.

332
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,120
 Every week, when I'm servicely,

333
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,720
 when I'm with you guys, this happens.

334
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,180
 And I think, really, we just have to remember

335
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,320
 that not to be scared, but to know that,

336
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,500
 at times, Satan does, it directly,

337
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,220
 want to take away and steal away

338
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,980
 what God is wanting to give us.

339
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,340
 So the second soil condition is the rocky road.

340
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,880
 So in this soil condition, in verses five to six,

341
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,340
 after scattering the seed,

342
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,520
 the seeds immediately spring up

343
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,380
 because it says in scripture

344
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,040
 that they have no depth in the soil.

345
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,540
 And when the scorching sun comes up,

346
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,740
 this little seed that sprouted,

347
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,780
 it withers because it had no rooting.

348
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,000
 It had no deep rooting in the soil.

349
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,420
 And when Jesus was explaining this to his disciples

350
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,740
 in verse 16 and 17, Jesus says,

351
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,740
 "These are the people who hear God's word,

352
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,260
 "and immediately, they receive it with joy."

353
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,300
 They are so excited that God is speaking to them.

354
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,860
 But their joy is short-lived

355
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,900
 because when the sun comes up,

356
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,940
 when persecution comes, when trouble comes,

357
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,100
 on account of the word, these listeners fall away.

358
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,220
 So the second obstacle is trouble.

359
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,040
 It's suffering.

360
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,060
 It's hard times.

361
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,980
 It's persecution.

362
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,380
 And it's going through these

363
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,320
 that causes disciples to fall away.

364
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,660
 Now, I wanna explain falling away.

365
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,060
 Once again, it's not a permanent state,

366
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,820
 but falling away, I think,

367
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,640
 describes an inability to follow Christ in that moment.

368
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,000
 And so we all encounter these moments where we're unable.

369
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,880
 We are unable to sustain a closeness,

370
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,280
 an intimacy with God,

371
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,920
 and that's what this soil represents.

372
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,520
 And once again, I want to remind us this is normal.

373
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,080
 This is not an abnormal,

374
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,480
 like this only happens to 10 or 5% of us.

375
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,720
 This is a fact of our daily lives.

376
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,180
 And historically, this was a very common problem,

377
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,840
 a common reality for the early church

378
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,380
 because being persecuted was synonymous

379
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,320
 with being a Christian back in the first century.

380
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,760
 A lot of Christians, they remained faithful to God

381
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,780
 even onto death, and we called them martyrs.

382
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,860
 They were willing to die for their faith.

383
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,100
 Now, of course, there were many that stumbled and fell away,

384
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,360
 and we don't actually get to hear about their accounts.

385
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,080
 And we do remember Peter, right, in the Gospels,

386
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
 and he vowed vigorously that,

387
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,440
 Lord, I will never deny you,

388
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,400
 and remember what happens.

389
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
 In his humanness, in the light of persecution,

390
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,120
 he was scared and he fled.

391
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,600
 Now, of course, when we read the whole Gospel,

392
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,560
 we realize that Peter grew from that,

393
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,000
 and he became one of the greatest disciples.

394
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,800
 And it says that the church was built upon him.

395
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,260
 And so maybe not every one of us would struggle

396
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,300
 or have struggled to a point of death,

397
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,640
 but some of us, I know, have been persecuted.

398
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,740
 A lot of us have been persecuted because of our faith,

399
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,420
 our family members not agreeing

400
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,540
 with this lifestyle choice that we made.

401
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,260
 And I know, actually, I've heard of some of you

402
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,360
 who work in very aggressive work environments

403
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,580
 where being a Christian is actually frowned upon,

404
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,420
 but yet somehow you persevered,

405
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
 somehow you remained faithful.

406
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,340
 And for us in Hong Kong,

407
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,780
 I don't know what the future brings.

408
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,900
 None of us do.

409
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,640
 I don't know how religious freedom is in the future,

410
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,160
 but I think listening has an impact today.

411
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,720
 Our listening today, in God's word,

412
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,300
 has an impact in how we respond tomorrow.

413
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,620
 So, so far, I just wanna recap

414
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,640
 in these first two soil conditions

415
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,080
 that the ability to retain Jesus's word meaningfully

416
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,400
 in these first two soil conditions is temporal

417
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,960
 because, one, the seed never had space to grow,

418
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,560
 and also, these two soil conditions,

419
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,200
 they prevent good listening.

420
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,780
 Now, I want to talk about the third soil conditions,

421
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,960
 which is the thorns.

422
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,800
 So in verse seven,

423
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,340
 when the seeds fell among the thorns,

424
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,200
 the thorns immediately came up and choked it

425
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,040
 and suffocated the seeds so that no crop could grow,

426
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,320
 so that seed could not germinate.

427
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,280
 And when explaining to his disciples,

428
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,640
 Jesus said that these are those who heard the word,

429
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,840
 but the cares of the world, the worries,

430
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,160
 the temptation of wealth,

431
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,720
 and the desire for other things

432
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,360
 prevented the word, God's word, from bearing any fruit.

433
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,100
 And so the third obstacles,

434
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,860
 we're talking about the worries that we have,

435
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,440
 the temptation of wealth, or even affluence,

436
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,860
 and these desires, they distract us, they entice us,

437
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,440
 they seduce us away from the path with Christ.

438
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,860
 And so the seeds never germinate or grows

439
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,200
 because we put our resources on all these other things

440
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,580
 and not on protecting God's word, so allowing it to grow.

441
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,780
 And I hate to mention this this morning, but I have to.

442
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,740
 The things that we're talking about here

443
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,940
 is maybe our mobile devices, right?

444
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,380
 It's maybe Netflix.

445
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,220
 It is.

446
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,860
 Some of us, even for good intentions,

447
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,680
 I overwork all the time, and that's a struggle,

448
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,420
 but yet it pulls me away from God.

449
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,380
 I'm two months to finishing

450
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,400
 my three-year master's right now,

451
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,540
 but the cost of the last three years

452
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,860
 has been immense in terms of time away from family,

453
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,900
 time away from God, and I feel it.

454
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,540
 And so there is a cost to our discipleship,

455
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,340
 and Mark actually highlights,

456
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,900
 and I want you to remember this

457
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,200
 and think about this in your life,

458
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,260
 that greed and affluence and having enough

459
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,260
 or wanting more will hinder and affect God's work in us.

460
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,100
 In Mark 10, verse 21, you remember this,

461
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,940
 there's a rich man, he turns away from Jesus' call

462
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,900
 because he had too much wealth,

463
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,940
 and he didn't want to give up the system

464
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,860
 in which he exploited the poor.

465
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,540
 And then there was Judas, who betrayed his own master,

466
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,540
 Jesus, for a small, small amount of money.

467
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,420
 And so this morning, I think God would want us

468
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,020
 to soberly reflect why it is so difficult

469
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,100
 for the rich to enter God's kingdom, right?

470
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,460
 Why it is so difficult, and I think we understand.

471
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,420
 And so if I can pull together so far

472
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,780
 what we've been talking about,

473
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,580
 this morning we're talking about discipleship,

474
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,060
 we're talking about conditions

475
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,660
 for good listening and bad listening,

476
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,500
 we're talking about the obstacles

477
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,180
 that will come in our way, in all of our ways,

478
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,320
 and affect and impact our faith.

479
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,060
 And once again, I want to say that this parable

480
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,580
 is talking about our spiritual reality.

481
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,460
 This is the tension which all of us

482
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,060
 will have to learn to navigate,

483
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,460
 and that's why Jesus is saying,

484
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,560
 "Church, I want you to hear me.

485
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,420
 "I want you to listen to what I'm saying to you."

486
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,340
 And actually, this warning, this parable,

487
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,800
 is it speaks so much about the scribes

488
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,060
 and the Pharisees in the Gospels.

489
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,460
 Imagine how many times they heard Jesus preach.

490
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,960
 Imagine how many times they heard God's word,

491
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,860
 but yet, what happens?

492
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,140
 Satan comes and steals the word from them,

493
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,940
 and they stop believing, they cannot believe.

494
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,900
 They vigorously reject the idea that God is Lord,

495
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,320
 so they kind of fall away in their discipleship.

496
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,960
 And of course, ultimately, they fell away from Jesus

497
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,960
 because they did not understand what Jesus was doing.

498
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,880
 That is why they couldn't have a relationship,

499
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,820
 a discipleship with Him.

500
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,940
 And so I want to say and acknowledge

501
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,680
 that the tension is real.

502
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,860
 And lastly, I want to talk about the good soil.

503
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,700
 In the fourth soil condition, in verse eight,

504
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,440
 the grains fall on good soil,

505
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,020
 and these crops, they grew in an abundant harvest

506
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,260
 of 30, 60, and 100-fold.

507
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,660
 The early church, when they immediately heard

508
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,100
 of bearing fruit, that these crops bore fruit,

509
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,360
 they would immediately equate this

510
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,300
 to faithfulness to Christ.

511
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,980
 So what this means for us is that to be faithful

512
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,380
 to Christ requires time.

513
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,620
 It requires a process for seeds to grow.

514
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,260
 It requires overcoming.

515
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,060
 And in terms of obstacles, the last batch of seeds

516
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,220
 grew to a harvest because these listeners

517
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,340
 were able to understand God's word.

518
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,380
 They were able to wrestle with God's word.

519
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,620
 They were able to trust that God's word

520
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,900
 would lead them through whatever obstacle

521
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,340
 and hindrances would come.

522
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,700
 And as a result, these seeds, these listeners,

523
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,060
 grew abundantly, they grew to a point

524
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,860
 of surpassing all human understanding.

525
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,660
 And so I think to remain in good soil

526
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,140
 is to humbly allow God to lead us

527
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,500
 and to teach us what it means to grow deep roots

528
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,040
 so that we do not lose sight of the new life

529
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,580
 that Jesus calls each of us into, which is God's kingdom.

530
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,700
 [audience laughing]

531
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,740
 And so you can see now that the different soil conditions

532
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,140
 that the first centuries Christians navigated through

533
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,220
 is not so much different than the discipleship reality

534
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,580
 that we live in right now.

535
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,580
 And preparing for this message,

536
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,340
 I reflected on the last 25 years of being a Christian.

537
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,060
 I reflected on the last 14 years of working in a church,

538
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,720
 which I think is one of the hardest places to work,

539
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,580
 I think, from experience.

540
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,580
 And so I just wanna list out,

541
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,900
 in relation to today's parable,

542
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,780
 some of the struggles I've gone through.

543
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,280
 It's gonna just come up here.

544
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,180
 You know, and you can go through this list,

545
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,140
 and I am sure you can relate to how

546
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,800
 and imagine how these things can cause us to be distracted,

547
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,540
 could cause us to stumble,

548
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,620
 it can cause us to be enticed away.

549
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,060
 But I just wanna speak into a few of these personally.

550
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,260
 In the last 10 years, I think all of us have experienced

551
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,580
 people leaving Hong Kong, right, family, friends.

552
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,140
 That's been hard, especially working in a church.

553
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,180
 But add to that, I've experienced a lot of brothers

554
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,580
 and sisters who walked away from the faith.

555
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,020
 I think they decided that it was just too difficult

556
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,440
 to sustain discipleship, and that is discouraging.

557
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,740
 There are times where I just ask the Lord,

558
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,140
 I would talk to my wife, and maybe I should just do the same.

559
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,180
 It just would be easier, you know.

560
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,520
 Another thing is apathy.

561
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,620
 I think all of us have to be very careful with apathy.

562
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,080
 And we get offended, I get offended, something happens,

563
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,620
 and my heart just gets harder, it grows harder.

564
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,300
 It's just less receptive to God's word.

565
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,600
 When Jesus talked about the rich man

566
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,420
 having the dangers of being wealthy,

567
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,700
 which I think a lot of us are, would say that,

568
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,720
 "You know, we are actually rich when we think about it."

569
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,820
 And that is distracting, that is difficult to navigate.

570
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,420
 How do I be faithful and enjoy the life that we have?

571
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,520
 I struggle with that, I feel bad all the time.

572
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,840
 And then lastly, I don't think I've been persecuted

573
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,420
 to a point of death, but I remember one time,

574
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,940
 I was trying to help this girl escape

575
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,640
 her abusive relationship with her boyfriend.

576
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,460
 And so we were in Wan Chai in the coffee shop,

577
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,720
 and the boyfriend, unbeknownst to us, came,

578
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 but he refused to come in the church.

579
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,960
 It's like he couldn't, and he was just angry,

580
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,580
 he was powerful, he was strong,

581
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,500
 and he just kept on yelling obscenities.

582
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,900
 And I just thought that it was an attack,

583
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,980
 it was Satan using the situation,

584
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,700
 and that really scared me, right?

585
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,320
 But all that to say, I think looking back,

586
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,540
 I can attest to the fact that God's grace

587
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,500
 has always been in these situations

588
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,740
 when I was going through it,

589
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,580
 and sometimes I just was not aware,

590
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,980
 but yet God's grace was there leading.

591
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,540
 But yet, I also reflect back on all the effort

592
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:11,240
 I had to put in to get out of certain soil conditions,

593
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,820
 so certain barriers, and I think, to this day,

594
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,140
 I'm glad that I stand before you,

595
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,240
 and I still confess Christ, I still love Christ.

596
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,060
 My love looks a little different than before,

597
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,160
 and I'm okay with that, but also,

598
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,940
 I still believe that we have so much to do as a church.

599
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,860
 And so I think I share this because I think

600
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,100
 one of the most difficult things for us

601
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,180
 to practice as a Christian is the very thing

602
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,420
 that Jesus is talking about in this parable.

603
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 How many of us hurry from event to event, thing to thing,

604
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,900
 especially for us parents or teachers,

605
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,540
 and there's just always needy children,

606
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,340
 which is the reality, right?

607
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,900
 But there is just so many things,

608
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,420
 and how many times do we say,

609
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,340
 hey, Lord, I'll come back to you later.

610
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
 I'll do this later, I promise.

611
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,980
 After I do all this, I will come back to you.

612
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,220
 But when you think about it, that's thorns at work, right?

613
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,380
 That's thorns at work in our life.

614
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,620
 And if there's one thing this morning

615
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,580
 I desperately want to convey to each of us here,

616
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,460
 what I wanna say is that it is extremely easy

617
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,420
 and effortless, it takes zero effort to stop growing

618
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,140
 and to walk away from God, if we choose that.

619
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,860
 It's effortless and it's very easy to get sidetracked,

620
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,380
 especially in moments of crisis,

621
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,080
 especially when we are persecuted, when we are suffering,

622
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,420
 when our hearts are broken.

623
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,220
 But I want to remind us once again

624
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,060
 that even if our hearts are broken,

625
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,260
 even if we are suffering in this moment

626
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,180
 and we cannot bear it, God is still faithful,

627
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,100
 and he's still gonna scatter seeds generously

628
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,020
 until one seed hits the good soil,

629
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,740
 it hits our heart and it grows.

630
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,620
 And for that, I think it's worth it.

631
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,420
 And recently, I think as an encouragement,

632
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,660
 I was very encouraged that these three,

633
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,100
 four soil conditions, it actually represents

634
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,060
 our universal human Christian experience.

635
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,620
 That this doesn't just happen to holy people,

636
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,520
 it happens to all of us 'cause we are holy.

637
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,580
 We love God and Satan would do everything

638
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,860
 to get us off course.

639
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,280
 And so I wanna say that no Christian

640
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,900
 is immune from falling away,

641
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,180
 just as no Christian couple is immune from divorce, right?

642
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,060
 I think Satan will continue to do his work

643
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,820
 and we will always have trouble.

644
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,000
 Once we solve one problem, another problem comes in, right?

645
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,140
 We know that at work, at the home,

646
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,620
 in our house, I feel like we fix something good,

647
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,420
 you know, oh man, the lights are working again

648
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,660
 and then we have like another problem, right?

649
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,220
 And so this parable, it's in a bleak

650
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,580
 and black and white way, it reminds us of two realities.

651
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,780
 One, we are either on the way towards Jesus, with Jesus,

652
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,820
 or we are somehow being led away.

653
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,860
 We are somehow struggling, we are somehow caught up

654
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,900
 in thorns and we are learning to get out

655
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,440
 of those conditions.

656
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,640
 But I want to comfort you, I'm not gonna end this message

657
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,820
 in gloom and doom.

658
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,720
 I know it is difficult to be a Christian

659
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,940
 and I think you know that, it is difficult

660
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,420
 and that's okay, but it's not impossible

661
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,620
 because of God's grace.

662
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,500
 So I want to now talk about God's grace for us as a church.

663
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,320
 And God's grace in this parable is an invitation

664
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,780
 for us this morning to reflect and to enter a space

665
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,800
 of deeper reflection through listening,

666
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,260
 to think about God and how we are with him

667
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,420
 through a deeper listening, but also listening

668
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,840
 invites us to a place of deeper surrender,

669
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,500
 to do things differently, to put away

670
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,680
 and to learn how to be a better listener.

671
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,340
 And I believe by learning we increase our,

672
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,980
 by listening we increase our receptivity

673
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,820
 to hear God's word, to understand God's word

674
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,780
 so that we can actually ultimately protect God's word

675
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,060
 growing in our lives.

676
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,660
 And so this morning right now to conclude

677
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,660
 I want to offer us three ways that God's grace

678
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,700
 is evident in this parable.

679
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,020
 And the first way is that God's grace reminds us

680
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,700
 that the kingdom of God is always at work

681
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,300
 even when we are not aware.

682
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:52,780
 And this is a hope, this is a promise for us

683
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,940
 that the sower that is Christ will continue

684
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,780
 to sow seeds and scatter seeds generously

685
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,660
 until it germinates beyond our wildest imaginations.

686
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,940
 And so Mark is reminding his listeners back then

687
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,540
 that against any setbacks, against any principalities,

688
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,420
 against any obstacles, God's kingdom will still advance

689
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,980
 and God's kingdom will continue to be victorious.

690
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,900
 So for those of us here this morning

691
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,300
 we're listening to God's word,

692
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,420
 we're learning to listen to God's word.

693
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,640
 We should continue to do so.

694
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,220
 For those of us who are faithful in preaching God's word

695
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,820
 we continue to share the gospel with our family,

696
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,940
 with our colleagues, with our friends.

697
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,540
 Let us remain steadfast, let us remain faithful

698
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,100
 because each seed has hope to grow

699
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,660
 and it just has to hit a good soil.

700
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,940
 And I think a lot of us are here

701
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,820
 because God's word hits good soil

702
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,720
 and we heard God and we're here.

703
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,020
 The second thing God's grace reminds us of this morning

704
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,320
 is God's paradoxical perspective on suffering.

705
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,940
 I think only in God's kingdom does hardship,

706
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,120
 suffering, persecution enables Jesus' community

707
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,420
 to grow and advance.

708
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,860
 That our discipleship, our journey with Jesus

709
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,300
 does not diminish but it actually yields a harvest

710
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,760
 if we are willing to harvest that.

711
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,600
 And the harvest here in this parable

712
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,040
 is really to know him.

713
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,520
 You know the harvest that triples,

714
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,680
 that goes 60 folds, 100 folds,

715
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,760
 it's the reality that we can know a living God.

716
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,280
 To know that his word is true, his promises is true.

717
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,260
 That is the harvest that we desire.

718
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,900
 And so we are able to overcome barriers

719
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,680
 and obstacles because we believe

720
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,360
 that the word of God is true, that he is true

721
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,180
 and that he is faithful to us.

722
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,200
 And the last, I think God's grace reminds us

723
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,720
 in this parable that each of us have to,

724
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,720
 we each of us bear the responsibility to stop and to listen.

725
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,200
 That each of us have this responsibility

726
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,520
 to listen to God's word because our very lives,

727
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,020
 our very faith depends on understanding

728
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,680
 what Jesus is saying to us.

729
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,120
 I think there are, as I said,

730
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,600
 I think there's too many ways for us as Christians

731
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,880
 to fall away, for our hearts to feel cold,

732
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,280
 for us to be distracted and enticed and seduced.

733
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,560
 And so it is our responsibility to figure out

734
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,720
 whether we want to be in that good soil.

735
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,740
 It's our responsibility to ask God to teach us

736
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,600
 how do we set deeper roots into the ground

737
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,100
 so that when the sun comes, when persecution comes,

738
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,040
 we are not blown away easily.

739
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,880
 It is our responsibilities to ask our neighbors

740
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,200
 to help us weed out some of the thorns

741
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,940
 in our gardens and our lives

742
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,340
 so that we can stay focused on Jesus.

743
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,880
 And so church, I want to just lastly say,

744
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,200
 let us take seriously this responsibility

745
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,000
 so that we can minimize the chances of being uprooted,

746
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,580
 of being deceived and being enticed away.

747
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,580
 And so this morning, I will really end now.

748
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,140
 I want to just ask us, how should we respond?

749
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,100
 How can we respond this morning?

750
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,060
 Thank you, Owen.

751
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,620
 You know, and this morning, really, once again,

752
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,620
 I'm talking about our discipleship journey,

753
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,320
 our relationship with Jesus.

754
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,060
 And I think by learning to listen,

755
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,580
 we are able to understand the four soil conditions,

756
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,720
 the spiritual tension, the reality

757
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,000
 that we live out our faith in,

758
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,780
 and that we can hopefully avoid some of the traps

759
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,020
 and we can continue to just grow and to enjoy Jesus

760
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,460
 and enjoy our worshiping of Jesus together.

761
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,960
 And if we do learn to listen,

762
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,420
 then we can continue to rely on God's word

763
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,920
 and then we are able to retain the vision

764
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,480
 of what it means to be Christ followers in this world.

765
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,080
 So that we can allow other people

766
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,200
 and bring other people to experience this harvest.

767
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,040
 And so church, I want to just ask you

768
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,520
 to really take seriously today

769
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,760
 and to take time to stop and pause

770
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,440
 and to listen to what God might be saying

771
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,240
 to you this morning.

772
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,060
 Because without God's word,

773
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,080
 I think we are only followers by name and by association.

774
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,400
 What makes us, I remember what Pastor John

775
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,960
 was preaching three weeks ago,

776
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,540
 what makes us salt and light

777
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,920
 is that we understand God's word.

778
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,360
 It's God's word that brings life to us

779
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,680
 and it's our ability to share God's word with others

780
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,600
 that makes us distinctly different and attractive

781
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,760
 and that is the only really way

782
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,720
 we can have conversations about God

783
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,080
 with through his word anyways.

784
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,880
 And so I just last say, I just want to encourage you.

785
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,480
 I know maybe some of us, you feel,

786
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,200
 we feel that we're in unfruitful soil.

787
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,720
 And to you, if that is you, I want to say, do not panic.

788
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,000
 Do not be ashamed, do not be afraid.

789
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,960
 You know, these conditions that we're in,

790
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,760
 they're not permanent.

791
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,340
 They're seasons, maybe it's been a very long season for you.

792
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,120
 But I just want to encourage you

793
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,000
 and I want to pray for you in a moment

794
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,760
 that we would find our way back to God's soil.

795
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,360
 We would just hold on to that seed that God has given you.

796
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:49,200
 And so I just, last thing I want to say

797
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,040
 that even if we momentarily walk away from God,

798
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,320
 once again, the faithful sower will continue

799
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,000
 just to sow his seeds until his seeds

800
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,820
 hit the good soil for us.

801
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,980
 And so church, can I pray for us?

802
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,180
 Can I ask you to stand?

803
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,760
 (gentle music)

804
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,440
 Father, we thank you for your word.

805
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,940
 And Father, we ask that this morning

806
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:28,700
 you would give us the courage to continue just to listen.

807
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:33,640
 And Father, for those of us who are facing some obstacles,

808
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,140
 we are facing hardship,

809
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,800
 we find it difficult to hear your word.

810
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,220
 We feel distracted, we feel there's too many things

811
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,640
 going on in our lives.

812
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,300
 Father, I pray for,

813
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:52,060
 I pray, Father, that your seed would be attractive,

814
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,180
 your word in us would lead us out of these moments,

815
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,620
 Lord God.

816
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,660
 Father, you would teach us how to hear your word today,

817
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,800
 what to do with your word today,

818
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 how to make time to just grow the seed, Lord God,

819
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,440
 that you've given us.

820
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,200
 And Father, I pray that you give us courage each day

821
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,620
 to live faithfully to you, to follow you, Jesus.

822
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,980
 And so Father, right now we choose to worship you.

823
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,760
 Father, we choose to follow you, and that is our desire.

824
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,080
 And Lord, I just wanna pray that your word

825
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,960
 would be more desirable than the riches of this world.

826
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,980
 It would be more desirable, more...

827
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:50,440
 Lord, it would just, Lord, we would just have,

828
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,500
 Lord, we would just want your word so badly,

829
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,440
 and that we would just learn

830
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,420
 to treasure your word in our life.

831
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,920
 That is what I wanna pray for us today.

832
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,860
 And so Jesus, we turn our eyes again to you in worship,

833
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,240
 in surrender, in reflection.

834
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,520
 So would you lead us in your name we pray, amen.

835
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,920
 Let's worship him together.
