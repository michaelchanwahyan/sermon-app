[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Thank you, Benedict.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Why don't we put our hands together for Benedict?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Just want to say up front, just want to say thank you.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Thank you for your love and support.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   I could feel that while I was sitting there.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Please continue to pray for us,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   for this project, for our church,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   as we are learning to serve and minister
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   to the younger generation in this city.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   What a coincidence that in the last couple of weeks,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   our sermon series was centered on
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   a particular person in the Bible.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And we're not just focusing on him.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   We're focusing on a very particular period of life in him.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   And that's 17 to right now,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   we're coming to about 30 years of his age.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   We've been looking at the young adult
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   like timeline in his life, Joseph.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   And we're going to continue.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   When the Bible started describing him
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   or when his narrative started, he was 17 years old
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   in Genesis chapter 37.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And now we're at chapter 41, and he's turning 30s.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   It's a little bit, you have to feedback.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   You have to lower the volume.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I don't dare to talk right now.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Okay, okay, much better.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Can we put our hands together for Toby and the production team?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   You guys are my hero.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And so although this guy, Joseph,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   he lived like a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   like not a galaxy, just another country far, far away
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   in a very different culture.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   But we know that as we could see in the story,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   there are challenges, there are struggles in his life,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   just as like you and me in a young generation
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   in this city right now,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   there are challenges and struggles in their life.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And so often we could see these kind of brokenness
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   or challenges or struggles.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   They start to become part of who we are.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   They start to shape our identity.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   For example, there are people in everywhere, basically.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   There are people who drink too much,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and we call them alcoholic.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We gave them a name,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and that starts to become their identity.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And people who maybe when they're in front of people,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   they're so insecure that they have to say something
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   that is not true to protect themselves.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   They have to tell a lie,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and we name these people liars.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We name them.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   That becomes their identity.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So sometimes the brokenness and our struggles in life,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   they do become part of who we are or part of our identity.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   When I was 18 years old,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   that's quite long ago now, okay.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   When I was 18 years old,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I did my A-levels exam.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I remember the last subject,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   the last exam I had to sit was the Chinese oral exams.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Oh, I can see there are people
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   who went through the same thing as me.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Good for you.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You don't have to review your age.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So in the Chinese oral exams and the A-levels,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   there are two parts.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   The first part,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I'll be given a particular topic on a slip of paper.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I've got 10 minutes to prepare,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   and then I have to give a three-minute speech.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Second part is a group discussion.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And the topic I received that day was this on the screen.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   The best gift for my childhood self.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's my topic.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So when my three-minute started,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   this is how I began that speech.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   If it were possible for me,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   the best gift that I could ever receive
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   as a three-year-old kid or child would be my mother.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I could tell immediately the entire room,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   all the audience,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   their eyes were on me.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   By the way, I mean, by audience,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I mean there were like two examiners there,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   a male and a female.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Both of them immediately looked at me.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   And I started sharing a little bit about myself.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And thanks to my youth pastor,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   who had a counseling background,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   when we were teenagers,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   every week at a youth group,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   he would come and lead some sort of like
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   self-reflective exercise.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   We talk about a life,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   like what are the ups and downs,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   and you have to draw a lifeline,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   that sort of things.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So by the time when I turned 18,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I was okay.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I mean, I'm decently aware of who I am,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   what I've been through,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and I'm decently like, okay,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I know what's going on in my life right now.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I know this and that happened,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and so now I'm like this or that.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So for three minutes,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I started unpacking my entire 18-year life
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   to these two examiners.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I told them how I lost my mother to cancer
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   at the age of three,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and how that impacted my life in different parts,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   how there's been constantly a void,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   a loneliness inside of me.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I've been always struggling with that,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and how I always wish my mother would be there with me
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   when I'm going through all the storms in life.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And so I could see there's a countdown timer,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and when it counts down to three, two, one,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I wrap up my speech with that sentence again,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   if it were all possible.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   For the three-year-old kid,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I would love to have my mom back.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And I could tell when the clock stops
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   or start like ringing,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I could see there's a drop of tear
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   in the female examiner's eyes,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and I'm like, wow.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   That's the story I told people when I was 18 years old.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   But that was also the story I told my counselor
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   when I was seated in her office on the chair
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   a couple years down the road.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   If you were here for a while,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   you probably have heard my story,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   how I struggled in uni and in seminary.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I struggled a lot, actually.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I had a little bit of depressive symptoms,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   and I was actively seeing a counselor back then.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I remember every time I sat in her office,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   we would just talk about things in my life,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   how I'm doing.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But then I felt I was always constantly
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   trying to connect all the things I'm going through,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   all my troubles, all my problems,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   to all the tragedy I had experienced when I was younger.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I had always been trying to connect
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   my current problems to my past circumstances.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I've been trying to say, yeah,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   because I've been a three-year-old kid without my mom,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and so I grew up this way, I was super insecure,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   and that's why I had this or that kind of problem.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And I felt like I've been trying to prove myself,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   or I've been trying to convince her, my counselor,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   that in everything that happened,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I'm just a victim here.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I don't know if you've ever felt that in you before,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   that you have to try and explain yourself
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   to prove or to show people that you are indeed a victim.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I've been trying to tell myself, to show myself,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and to show my counselor,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   I was trying to make her agree with me
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   so that she would acknowledge,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   "Yes, Chapman, none of this is your fault.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   "You're just a victim, you lost your mom when you were young,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   "so that's why you're going through all this."
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I was trying to convince her and convince myself that.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Because after a while, I realized
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I was not the only one having this kind of urge
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   to show or prove that I'm a victim.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Psychologists, they actually research on this,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   and they call this the victim mentality.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Victim mentality is a learned psychological response
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   rooted in this idea called learned helplessness,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   where individuals feel trapped in cycles of perceived victimhood,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   hindering their ability to move forward.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Rather than being an inherent personality trait,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   it develops through specific experiences
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   and cognitive frameworks.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So we learn that in life, that we're a victim.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   This mindset is characterized by a persistent belief
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   that one is powerless against negative circumstances,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   attributing hardships to external forces
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   and seeing attempts to change as futile.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And so psychologists, they did a lot of research on this,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and they have identified three fundamental beliefs
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   that sustain victim mentality.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Let's go through them one by one.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   The first one, bad things happen
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and will continue to happen regardless of my actions.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Whatever I do, bad things will just keep happening.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   I can't control that.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Or number two, other people or external circumstances
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   are to blame for someone's misfortune.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Or in my case, I lost my mom. I couldn't help.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I cannot control that. I couldn't have her back.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So I am who I am. This is the way I live.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And I'm traumatized. I can't do anything about it.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Or number three, any efforts to create change
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   will inevitably fail, making attempts pointless.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I try to change, but I'm always insecure.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I can't be more secure because I don't have a mom in my life.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   What do you expect from me? I'm a victim here.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I'm a victim here. Yeah, I know I fail.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I know I flunk my exams, but you shouldn't blame me
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   because I'm the victim here.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   That's what I went through when I was younger.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So it says here, "These beliefs trap people in cycles of helplessness,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   making them see challenges as permanent and beyond their control,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   hindering positive change."
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   That's why they are always stuck in their tragedies.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   They are always stuck in their struggles.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   For example, perhaps someone feels they're never appreciated by their boss,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   no matter how hard they try,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   no matter how many nights they spend in the office,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   you know, OT, and they're stuck in the career.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   But if you ask them, "Why don't you get another job?"
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   They'll say, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I don't know if I can find another job that easy.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I don't know if I will ever have any boss that will like me."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   They'll say no to you.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Or perhaps someone has been rejected or hurt in a relationship before,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and they decided to avoid starting another meaningful relationship,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   not just romantic ones, even normal social relationships.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   They start to hide themselves behind closed doors and say,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   "I'm not convinced that anyone would want to be my friend.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I don't think anyone would like me.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   I think I'm such a person that nobody would want to be my friend."
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   So these people, they're just stuck in that kind of victimhood.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And when we dive back into Joseph's story,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   and we can see, "Hey man, this is a real victim here.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Come on. Think about his life.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   He was betrayed by his own brothers,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   suggesting to him that even those who were closest to him in his life,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   even his flesh and blood, his own family, could betray him.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   They could not be trusted.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And then he was sold into slavery.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   He lost his freedom.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   He lost his power to control over his life.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   He's powerless over his own circumstances.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And he was falsely accused by the wife of his boss.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   He didn't lie, despite his integrity.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   That led to his unjust imprisonment.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And even in prison, he met this guy, his fellow cellmate,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and he thought, "Oh, this guy had a dream.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I know how to interpret dreams. It just so happened.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Let me interpret his dream."
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And so he got restored. He got out of jail.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And I thought, "This guy is going to help me.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   This is my ticket out of here."
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And guess what?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   That cup bearer forgot about him the moment he left the prison.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So at the beginning of chapter 41 of Genesis,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   the author wrote these words,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   "When two full years had passed."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   When two full years had passed means nothing happened in two full years.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   He was in jail, seated there for the wrong reason.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   He didn't do anything, and he didn't get any help.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   He was there stuck in the prison for two full years by himself.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Joseph could have asked himself this question like a million times,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   at least a couple hundred times.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   "I wonder if my friend, the cup bearer, is going to mention my name to Pharaoh today.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Oh yeah, today, he just went out for two days.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Maybe he haven't really seen Pharaoh yet. That's okay.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Oh, it's been a week now.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Maybe he's busy. Maybe Pharaoh is busy.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Oh, it's been a month. I wonder how that guy is doing.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And then it's two years.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Where has he been?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Has he forgotten about me?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   No news, no visitors, just disappointment in his life.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   If I put myself in his shoes, I would be thinking this.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   First, I wouldn't be sure if I could--
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I'm not even sure if there's any faith left inside of me,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   faith in man and faith in God.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I think I would have become a very cynical person.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I might assume the worst in every single one around me.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   I might think that God has abandoned me, so I might as well just do the same to him.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Or maybe I would just come to terms with a lesser version of God,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   who may still love me, but he's totally incapable of helping me
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   or at least getting me out of the prison.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Or I'll just have to live with it.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   That's okay. I'm a slave. I'm a prisoner.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Probably I'll be a slave or a prisoner for the rest of my life.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   There's no help. God is--
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   He abandoned me, or he's not great enough.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   This is called learned helplessness.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   I'm not sure when we're facing difficulties, challenges in life,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   do we ask these kind of questions.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   A while ago, I was facing some challenges in my life,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   and I recorded some of my thoughts in a notebook,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   and I literally wrote these down.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   I said, "Has my favor run out?"
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Like, "Is God not favoring me anymore? Has my favor run out?"
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   "Does he not love me anymore? Does he not want me anymore?"
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   "Is he done with me?"
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   I have all these dark thoughts in me that I have to battle every day,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   and these are some of the learned helplessness in our lives.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And these thoughts, they start to change us.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   They start to shape our perspective.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   They will make us see ourselves as a victim or a prisoner all the time.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   We can see ourselves as victim of a dysfunctional family sometimes.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   We can see ourselves as victims of a bad economy
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   because there's a trade war going on.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I'm suffering. I'm the collateral damage.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And sometimes we can see ourselves as prisoners to physical or emotional abuse,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   and we are caught in a victimhood.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   We're caught in being a victim.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And so this victim mentality, it is indeed a prison of the mind.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   When we're stuck in these kind of dark thoughts, these victim mentality,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   it becomes a prison for our mind.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   While a physical prison may limit someone's movement or freedom externally,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   this mentality or this victim mentality, it limits someone's internal freedom.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And we may be walking outside, but inside we felt we're not enough.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   We felt I can't do anything with my life because I don't have what it takes anymore,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   because I'm not good enough anymore, because nobody wants me anymore,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   because I'm a victim, because this or that happened in my life before.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   That's why I am not entitled to a full life anymore.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It becomes a prison internally.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   And even if circumstances change, and they do change sometimes,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   the victim mentality can keep a person locked in their past.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Oh yeah, that happened in the past, so I can't imagine there's a future.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Before I was diagnosed with ADHD, that's exactly how I felt.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   I thought I felt so many times before, I can't foresee there's a future for me.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   I can't see there's any chance of success for me in the future.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   We're stuck in the past.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   It prevents us from stepping into healing or purpose or any new opportunities.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   So Genesis 41 showed us how Joseph was brought out of the physical prison.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Let's continue with that verse just now.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It says Pharaoh had a dream.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   In fact, he had two dreams.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   The first one, seven sleek and fat cows came up from Nile,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   they were just eating, and then suddenly there were seven ugly cows came up,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and they just ate those seven cows.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   First dream, done.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And second dream, oh, there is this seven healthy grain growing up,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   and then there is this seven ugly, like, scorched grain heads growing up,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   and they kind of like eat it.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I don't know how grain can eat grain, so.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I've been imagining this so many times, I still can't understand this dream,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   but anyway, it's a dream, so just live with it.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   So the two dreams are basically the same dream, but they are also two dreams.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   And Pharaoh woke up, and he tried to ask his staff,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   "Hey, can anyone tell me, hey, magicians, hey, you guys,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   you study the stars or whatever, and can you tell me what is this about?"
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Nobody could answer that.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   And suddenly this guy was holding his cup.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Oh, I remember a guy from the prison.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   He interpreted my dream.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Oh, my Lord, maybe he could interpret your dream as well.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And so now we see Joseph was brought out of the prison,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   and he stood before Pharaoh.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Great for him.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   He was physically taken out of the prison.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   And, of course, Pharaoh asked him to do what he does best,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   dream interpretation, right?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And so now we know that all those seven, like, fat cows or, like, the healthy grains,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   it represents seven years of abundance that's coming,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   and then the other seven means seven years of famine coming.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   So this is just Joseph doing his thing.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   But here I would like to describe it as what I would call a combo of gifts and talents.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Joseph didn't just interpret it supernaturally, the dreams of Pharaoh.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   That's a supernatural gift.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But he also told him, "Hey, Pharaoh, you know, I got a game plan.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   You just have to, you know, during that seven years of abundance,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   you just have to store up everything, and during those seven years of famine,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   we can take care of that.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   This is the game plan.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Come on, you just need someone who is so smart, who is so mature, who is a mastermind."
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And just so happened he himself is one.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   We see a combo of gifts and talents, supernatural gifts and natural talent.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   The supernatural gift of dream interpretation and his natural talent,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   he's an administrative mastermind, which I'm definitely not one.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   But I know there are a lot in our midst as well.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   But so he was using his God-given gifts.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   He knows dream interpretation that comes from God.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   God provided this ability to him.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And even his administrative mastermind, that skill, it also comes from God.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   God provided him with the necessary skills and talents for him to get out of prison.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   So immediately he transitioned from prison to palace,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   or he transitioned from being a forgotten prisoner rotting in his cell
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   to the second in command in the entire nation of Egypt.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Two years, two full years of waiting in prison,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   yet it only took a two-minute speech, a two-minute dream interpretation to get him out of there.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Like, "Wow, God, why don't you give him that dream earlier?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   It just took two minutes and see, I'm out here. I'm good again."
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Although the palace had always been God's purpose and plan for Joseph,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   let me say that the palace has always been God's purpose and plan for Joseph since day one.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   He couldn't see it. Joseph couldn't see the palace while he was in the prison.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   How could he? How could he imagine there's a palace waiting for him
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   while he's rotting in his cell, forgotten, nobody remembered him.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   He couldn't see that when he was in his slavery.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   He definitely couldn't see that when his brothers dumped him in that pit.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   We also can't see God's purpose and plans in our life all the time,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   especially when we're in our struggles.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   When we lose a job and couldn't find another one,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   when we were dumped, I guess,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   like your beloved boyfriend or girlfriend decided to break up with you,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   or when there's a serious problem in your health, in your family,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   financially you're struggling,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   when we're in that prison, when we're in that pit,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   there's no way we can imagine we could see the palace that God has prepared for us.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   There's no way that we could see the purpose and the plans that God has for us.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   If I'm honest with you, a lot of times, well not a lot of times, sometimes,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   a decent amount of time, I do feel that.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Before this Uncharted project came into being,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   for the last couple of months I've been wondering,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   "What am I doing here, God? What am I doing with my life right now?"
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   There are times that we're just simply stuck in the prison,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   and in the prison it's so hard to see what's out there for me,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   what God has planned for me.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And we're like, "God, what am I doing here? Where are you?"
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   We're sitting ducked, like we're just stuck here.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   "God, where are you? Where are you?"
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   But there's one thing today perhaps we could learn from Joseph.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   When we cannot see God's purpose and plans for us,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   at least we could still hold on to his presence and his provision.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Joseph, he didn't see God's plans and his purpose for him,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   yet he was holding on to God's provision and God's presence in his life.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   That's what we read in the last couple of chapters.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   We saw that Joseph knew the presence of God was with him.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   He treasured that presence, and he honored God even in Potiphar's house,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   so that he rejected that temptation.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   He's not doing it out of his fear or his respect for Potiphar, his boss.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   He was doing it out of his respect for God.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   He feared God, and he treasured that presence of God that he knew was in his life.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   He wanted to continue to steward that presence.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And, you know, in his life, we could see that.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   We could see that when he was in the prison,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   and he was interpreting dreams and doing all that,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   he knew he's using heavenly resources, his ability from God,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   allowing him to do so, to interpret dreams.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   He could say, "I cannot do this, but the interpretation of dreams is with God."
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   What we know is God providing him that ability to do that.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   He was holding on to the presence of God.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   He was holding on to the provision of God in his life,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   even though he cannot see the purpose and the plans of God in his life.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   But sometimes we give up too soon.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   "Sorry, I'm stuck right now. I thought my career would be taking off.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   I'm stuck here right now.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I totally cannot see what God is doing, what He has planned for me.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Maybe I should give up now. Maybe I should walk away from my faith right now."
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Sometimes we give up too soon because we cannot see the purpose and the plans from God.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   But Joseph here, he couldn't see that too.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   He simply held on to God's presence and His provision.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   He asked me, "How do you do that, Chapman?"
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Let me tell you, it is by spiritual discipline,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   which I've talked about a couple of months ago.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   You see, if you don't have spiritual discipline,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   you'll be happily worshipping God in good days.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   And in bad days, you're like, "God, I hate you. You've forgotten about me.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I don't want you anymore."
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Sometimes my daughters tell me that, and I don't do what they like.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   So I know.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Spiritual discipline makes sure we stay there in the presence of God.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   We come in front of Him and worship Him every day.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Like regardless, God, regardless what happens, I'm here to worship you.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   I'm here to draw near into your presence.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I'm here to stay with you.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And indeed, it's in your spiritual discipline, it's where you encounter God.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   And when you encounter God, your faith levels start to rise inside of you.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Sometimes when we're looking at our circumstances, we thought,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "Okay, maybe I'm not quite sure if God is here. I'm not quite sure God is with me."
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And it's harder even to say God has a purpose for me or a plan for me in my life.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I know when I'm in good days and I'm getting a promotion,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   when I'm in church, you know, "Oh, Enoch is leading a great worship time.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Yeah, maybe I can feel that."
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   But when my boss says, "Sorry, I'm letting you go."
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   When my partner is saying, "Sorry, we have to break up now."
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   You certainly don't see that or you certainly don't feel that,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   that God has a purpose, that God has a plan for you right there, right then.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   If it's up to our feelings, we probably would have run away from God.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   But if it's up to our discipline, if we discipline ourselves,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   no matter how hard it is, we come before God and say,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   "God, I'm struggling with this, but I know your presence is still here,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   and I just want to be in your presence."
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Then we meet Him.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   There our faith will start to rise.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Sometimes it's so hard in our circumstances to say that God has a plan for me.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I know we need to declare by faith.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I know that I've read everything about it in the Bible.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I know that we live by faith and not by sight.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   But if you've been there like I did, you would know it's extremely difficult
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   when a circumstance happens in your life that, you know, I'm doomed.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   It's so hard to believe that God still has something for me.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   But if you cannot see God's plan and purpose for you,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   why don't you just simply come into His presence?
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Hold on to His presence.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Hold on to His provision in your life and allow Him to meet you there.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Allow Him to speak to you.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Allow Him to fill you with His Holy Spirit once again.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's not when you have stored up enough faith,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   you come to God and declare all those great things.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   It's when you are empty inside.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   You come before God in His presence and you feel,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   "Oh, God, you are filling up that tank of faith again
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   because in worship I start to see who you are.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I start to see your majesty. I start to see your glory.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   I start to feel your love once again.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Your joy starts to flow in me so I can have faith to declare that,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   yes, I believe there is a plan.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   There is a purpose from God for me, although I don't see it now,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   but I totally believe it."
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   It's not the other way around.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   It's not you try to buff up and say, "Yes, I believe."
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   No, it's when you're weak, you just simply come before God,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   just as who you are, and you allow the Holy Spirit
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   to fill you with faith and love, and you can--
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   so that you are able to say those words once again.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   If there's something I'm learning from Joseph, this is it.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   There's so many times in my life I can't see God's purpose,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   I can't see His plans, but I know His presence is still here.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I know He's still providing for me, and I'm just going to hold on to that.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   God brought Joseph out of the physical prison
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   the day Pharaoh summoned him, but that was not the end.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   God wanted to free him from that prison of the mind as well.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I'm going to read the last bit of chapter 41.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   It says, "Before the years of the famine came,"
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   so during that seven years of abundance,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   "two sons were born to Joseph.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   The firstborn, Joseph named him Manasseh,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   and said, 'It is because God has made me forget
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   all my trouble and all my father's household.'
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   The second son he named Ephraim, and said,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   'It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.'"
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   God healed Joseph, his wounds in his family,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   by giving him another family, giving him his own family.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   When his first son was born, he named him Forget.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Who would ever name their kid like that?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Hey, I'm having a kid. What do you want to name him?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Forget. Forget him, forget me, forget who?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Forget.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   But this name Manasseh, it is really significant
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   because it describes not just what God had done externally
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   to remove him from the prison,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   it also talks about what God is doing internally
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   in Joseph to set him free from his past.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   It says, "God has made me forget all my trouble
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   and all my father's household."
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   You see, forgetting in the Bible,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   it's not just talking about the absence of your memory
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   or your memory being erased that you can't remember anymore.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   It actually talks about refocusing.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   It talks about a shift in perspective.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   It talks about a change in focus and a new way to interpret his past.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   So forgetting, it doesn't mean those memories in the past
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   suffering was lost or erased. Not at all.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   This word in the Bible or in the Hebrew,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   it could also mean like neglect or like overlook.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Now he has a new focus. That doesn't matter anymore.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   He's looking at something else.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   He's fixing his eyes on something else.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And that's the things that God has laid before him.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   You know, we might have been victimized
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   in certain circumstances in our lives,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   but we're more than that.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   I don't look at myself and call myself,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   "Yeah, I'm that guy who lost his mom when I was three."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   I just keep reminding myself, "I moved on from that.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Yes, that tragedy happened in my life,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   but there's so much more in my life.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I have friends. I have a community.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   I have a family here who loves me.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I have a family inside that room who loves me as well.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   I'm loved. I'm filled with love.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   God has put all these friends and people,
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   I would call family, around me.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I'm not just that boy who lost his mom,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   who's crying, who is lonely.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   I'm not that boy anymore.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   There's something else God has done in my life.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   I can move on. I can forget,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   not forgetting the fact that my mom did pass,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   but I'm refocusing myself in a new identity.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   That doesn't have to be the only thing
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   that defines who I am anymore.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   When Paul wrote this to the Philippians,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   he said, "I should forget what is behind
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   so that I could strain forward to what is ahead."
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Again, Paul was not talking about
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   whatever happened in the past.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   "I can't remember anymore. Amnesia.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   I don't remember what happened."
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   He's not talking about that.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   All those things happened in the past,
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   it's still in his memory,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   but now he's not focusing on that anymore.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   He's not trying to base his identity
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   on his past achievements or past failures.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   He said, "Now I have a new identity.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   God has called me. Christ has called me.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I'm running this race. I'm straining forward."
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   This is exactly the same, what Joseph is doing here.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   He said, "I'll forget my past.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   I'll forget all those troubles.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Those troubles, they don't define me anymore.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I'm not a prisoner anymore.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   I'm not a slave anymore.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   I'm not the abandoned one anymore.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Now I'm a trustworthy leader.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Now I'm a father,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   and I'm going to walk in my identity.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   I'm going to walk in my new destiny."
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And perhaps, some of us,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   we need to remove some of these,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   or forget some of these labels in our lives,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   some of these identities that we held on to.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Maybe it's time for us to have a new identity.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That's not the end.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   The second son, he named him Ephraim,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   and said, "God has made me fruitful
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   in the land of my suffering."
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   The story of Joseph reminded us
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   something very important here.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   You see this word, "fruitful,"
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   the first time it appeared in the Bible,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   it was Genesis 1, verse 28,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   when God created Adam and Eve.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   He blessed them and said,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   "Be fruitful and multiply."
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   You know, being fruitful is the first ever blessing
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   that humanity received from God.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   It was always in God's plan for you and me,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   for the entire humanity,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   to be fruitful.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   But because of our rebellion,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   because of our sin,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   sin entered this world,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   pain entered this world,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   suffering entered this world,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   death entered this world,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   and this world had become a land of suffering.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And yet, Joseph is saying here,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   "God has made me fruitful
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   in the land of my suffering."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   You know what? Yes.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Because of our sin,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   because of the sin of others in this world,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   this is indeed a land of suffering,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   but God has not given up blessing us.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   He has not given up His purpose.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   His purpose is to see us being fruitful in our lives.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   That's why when Jesus came, He said,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   "Yeah, the thief would come,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   he would still kill and destroy,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   but the Son of Man has come,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   and I'm here to give you life,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   and life to the fullness.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   I'm here to give you a fruitful life.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   I'm here to restore the first blessing,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   the first command of God in your life,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   so that you would have a fruitful life."
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   So whatever you faced in the past,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   whatever you suffered in your memories,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   that does not matter anymore,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   because God is here to give you a new identity.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   He is here to give you a new future.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   There is a purpose in your life.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   There is a plan in your life.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Maybe you and I don't see that right now,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   but God says, "I'm here to bring restoration
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   to our broken life,"
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   so that He's determined God will make you and I
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   fruitful in the land of suffering.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   This world is still a land of suffering
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   to a certain extent,
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   but God said, "I'm determined to make you fruitful.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I'm determined to be with you,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   to pour out my Spirit in your life.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   I'm determined to bless you."
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And so, if you feel you're in a land of suffering right now,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   like Joseph,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   my prayer for you is that
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   you too will be able to stand in front of God one day
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and say, "God has made me fruitful
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   in my land of suffering."
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   There's something we can learn from Joseph today,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   that we don't always see God's plans
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   and His purpose in our lives,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   but if we stick to our spiritual discipline,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   we can still hold on to His presence,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   we can still hold on to His provision,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   and we'll ultimately see that when we walk with God,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   He is the one who makes us forget,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   who makes us refocus, reorientate our mind
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   on the new identity that He wants to give us.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   We don't have to be stuck in our past,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   stuck in our trauma.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Our trauma never gets the final word in our lives.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   He made us forget, you know,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   leave it behind so that we can move forward,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   and we'll finally see that even in the land of our suffering,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   God is going to make us fruitful here.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   This is the good news that we're here to bring
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   to Hong Kong, to the next generation,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   to those around us.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Shall we pray?
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Why don't we stand?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   [Pause]
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   I just want to begin praying by saying that
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   God knows your pain today.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Whatever I've said in the last 30 minutes,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   it doesn't mean your pain does not matter to God.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   I'm not saying that.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   It does.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   God is still the God who would hold your tears.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   He's still the one who put His arms around you.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   But He's simply saying,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   "I do not reject your pain, but at the same time,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   I don't want to let your pain define who you are."
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And that's why I'm here,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and that's what I want to do in your life today.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Maybe for some of us today, it's time to let go.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   It's time to forget, to reorient,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   reorientate our thoughts and our identity.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Maybe you're still holding on to something
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   that you've experienced in the past.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   Maybe that becomes part of your identity.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   That's how you think of yourself.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   That's how sometimes other people think of you.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   God says it's time to forget and move on,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   to leave it behind.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   If you're willing to let go, He's ready.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   He's ready to do that in your life.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   If you give Him permission,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   He's ready to come and give you a heart surgery today
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   so that when you walk out of these doors,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   you see yourself as a new person.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   You see yourself with a new destiny.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   You see yourself with a new identity.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   And we're more than willing to pray with you today.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   I feel some of us, we just need to--
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   if you've been asking the question, "God,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   what's your purpose?
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   What's your plan in my life?"
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I need to see that before I can trust you.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Can I gently invite you to give that up as well?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   As a matter of fact,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   we don't always see His plans and purposes for us,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   sometimes only from hindsight, like Joseph.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Like he could say, "Oh, God brought me to Egypt
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   to preserve all of your lives."
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   He only knew it from hindsight,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   not that he got a vision or calling
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   before he was taken to Egypt.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   No, he didn't.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Sometimes you will only understand God's purpose
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   and plan in your life on hindsight.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   You will only understand after it happened,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   are you okay with that?
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   Maybe you're stuck because you want God to tell you,
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   lay out the entire plan,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   give you a timeline before you can move forward.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I invite you today,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   just lean into His presence.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   And His presence allowed yourself
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   to gaze upon Him to know how mighty He is,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   so that even when you don't know the entire plan,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   you trust Him enough.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   You don't just trust His plans,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   you trust Him.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I pray for breakthrough in faith.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I pray for healing in hearts.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Come Holy Spirit,
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   we make room for you to do what only you can do
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and to do what only you want to do in our hearts.
