[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   Amen, amen.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.680]   Can we put our hands together
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.800]   and thank our worship team as always.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.200]   Have a seat, it's great to have you here.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.920]   Welcome to the 11 o'clock service.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.840]   We have four services at the Vine on a Sunday,
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.200]   9, 15, 11, two, and four.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.520]   If you are here, you're here at the 11.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.160]   Welcome everybody online, it's so good to see you.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.480]   I know that people are tuning in
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.200]   from all over the world still to our live stream.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.960]   We're so glad if you're part of the Vine Church
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.040]   outside of Hong Kong, welcome.

[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.160]   It's always good to know that the Vine Church
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.000]   is more than just what we have as our 50% in this room.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.520]   It is also many of you that are watching in this moment.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.560]   So welcome to you and welcome to each person
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.440]   that managed to get a ticket that is here,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.240]   that is present, that didn't have a staycation
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.200]   on the long weekend, welcome.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200]   It's great to have you here with us as well.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.520]   I wanna start by telling you about the day
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.360]   that I was arrested.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.840]   So I was 19 years old at the time.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.680]   I was in the first year of university.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.840]   Hands up if you were arrested
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.040]   in your first year at university.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920]   Come on, let's see those, okay.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.560]   Now, the only thing you really need to know
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   about me back in those days
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.680]   when I was a 19 year old at university
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.320]   was that I had very long hair.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.920]   I'm not just talking about like sort of a little bit longer
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.280]   than you see now, like I need to get
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.120]   a little bit of a haircut.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120]   I'm talking about like seriously long hair.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.960]   I had hair that kind of came down
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.200]   to like the middle of your back, you know,
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.600]   ponytail, I'd shave it underneath.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600]   I wore black all the time from head to toe.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.400]   I was into death metal music, right?
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.080]   This was before I got saved, just wanna say, all right.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.960]   But I was into this like crazy music.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.680]   I was like wearing black all the time
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   and I had super long hair.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.000]   I thought I was super cool.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.760]   Now, the problem was I wasn't cool.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.920]   The problem was I went to a university called Durham
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.200]   in the Northeast of England
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.280]   and Durham is a small university town,
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.680]   but there's a bit of an issue.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.640]   Number one, the surrounding area of Durham
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   is kind of like a working class North of England
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.840]   kind of surrounding area, very proud of its industry.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200]   And most of the men within the working class there
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.440]   never would have long hair.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.640]   In fact, they look at long haired people as weirdos, right?
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.000]   Likewise, at my university,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.320]   it was kind of like this middle to upper class university
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.000]   where a lot of the kids that were studying there
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.560]   had gone to public schools in the UK.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.640]   And if you were a guy that went to public school in the UK,
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.920]   you did not have long hair tied in your ponytail
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.800]   down the middle of your back wearing black all day.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.480]   So basically I stood out
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.200]   in terms of who I was at Durham like completely, right?
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.360]   So much so that by the end of the first year,
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.560]   I was thinking about cutting my hair
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.320]   just so that I could fit in a little bit better.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.720]   Now on this one particular day that I got arrested,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.440]   I was walking down this long road
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.920]   that goes from the top of where I was living at the time
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.760]   to the bottom of Durham where my university lecture hall was.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.200]   And I'm walking down this road
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.960]   and on the other side of the road, about a hundred yards away,
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.600]   a policeman is walking up in the opposite direction.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.400]   And as the policeman's walking up,
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.360]   he gazes over and he sees me coming down
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.640]   on the other side of the road.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   And immediately I had this sense, you know, the spider sense.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.320]   There's a policeman staring at you
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.080]   and suddenly you don't feel like 100% comfortable anymore.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.280]   Like you're like, what is wrong?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   Have I done something?
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.560]   What's the problem here?
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.400]   And the officer crosses over onto my side of the street,
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.640]   walks right up to me and he comes straight up to me.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.400]   And this was his opening words.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.840]   He says, "You have long hair."
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.520]   And I'm like, wow, you're perceptive here today, officer.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.400]   Right? I'm like, yes, I do.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.320]   He's like, "You have no idea how happy I am to meet you."
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.640]   I'm like, oh, that's cool.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.120]   He's like, "I've been searching over the whole of Durham
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.040]   "to find men with long hair.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.640]   "Do you know how hard it is to find men
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.040]   "with long hair in Durham?"
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.240]   I'm like, yes, I do.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.720]   'Cause I have never seen one.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.480]   And he's like, "I finally found you.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.800]   "And I'm wondering, would you come with me
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.400]   "and be a part of a police lineup at the police station?"
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.600]   'Cause it turned out that they had arrested
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.560]   somebody who had long hair
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.440]   and they were looking for five other men
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.200]   of about the same age, about the same height,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.280]   with long hair to be a part of the lineup.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.040]   I was like, no, I don't wanna do that.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.160]   And he's like, "We'll pay you."
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   I'm like, where do I sign?
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.720]   I'm a student, right?
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   I'm like, where I'll go.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.040]   So the next day, I'm down there at the police station.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.640]   I walk into the little side room
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.720]   and I walk into this room and lo and behold,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.560]   there's five other men in that room with long hair.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.880]   Immediately, we're like best friends.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.640]   It's like, where have you been all my life?
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.920]   We're like swapping shampoo techniques and everything.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.240]   Like, it's awesome.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.680]   We're like the best friends straight away.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.760]   And the police officer from the other day comes in.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.360]   He's like, "Right, it's very simple, very easy.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.320]   "We're gonna give you a number.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.280]   "You're gonna walk into the room here on the left
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.040]   "and you'll see some places on the floor.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.320]   "You're gonna line up and you're gonna hold your number
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.720]   "and you're just gonna look forwards into the mirror
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.640]   "that's gonna be in front of you.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.920]   "Now, when you're standing there,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.600]   "we're gonna bring in this guy.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.440]   "We're gonna bring him in.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.440]   "He's gonna then join you in that lineup
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.920]   "and then the light will come on
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.600]   "and it will blind you in your face
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.360]   "and you'll just see the mirror in front of you,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.840]   "but it's one way mirrored glass
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.720]   "and there's the witness behind the mirror.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.200]   "And once you're standing there,
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.960]   "the lights are on and he's in place,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.160]   "then I just want you to do whatever the voice
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.080]   "over the intercom tells you to do."
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.480]   Cool, we're like easiest money we've ever made, right?
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.160]   So we get given our numbers, we go into the room
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.240]   and I'm standing there, there's one person here,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.680]   the second person, there's me here, number three.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.000]   There was an empty spot in number four
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.880]   and then there was five and six.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.560]   And as we're standing there, the door opens
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.800]   and this guy walks in.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.080]   Now, I don't know what a criminal looks like.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.440]   But this guy looked like a criminal, are you with me?
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.600]   Like, I don't know what he had done,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.640]   but it was obvious to me that he was guilty, right?
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.480]   I mean, he walked in and all of us were like,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.920]   "We don't look anything like this guy.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.040]   "Like we might have long hair, but this guy is guilty
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.640]   "and we're super sweet and innocent," right?
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.120]   So he comes and he stands right next to me
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.440]   and immediately I'm sensing just the evil from this man.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   He's standing there and we're all standing there,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.320]   we've all got our numbers, we're all looking up
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.240]   and the lights come on, there we go, we've started.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.160]   And it's funny, right?
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.680]   Because if you're staring forward
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.120]   and you only have a mirror, you don't stare at yourself.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.800]   So the five of us are all staring at this guy right here
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.760]   in the mirror, right?
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.320]   Like we're just looking at him, eyes fixed, right?
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.560]   So we're standing there, as he's standing there
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.760]   in that position, number four,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.520]   and suddenly the voice comes on in the intercom system,
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.560]   "Number four, would you please stand forward?"
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.760]   And we're all like, we can't do anything,
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.360]   but I know that the five of us are all kind of like,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.240]   "(laughs)
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.320]   "You know, you've..."
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.920]   Anyway, the guy next to me doesn't move.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.760]   Like he's just standing there.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.480]   I'm like, "Man, this guy is tough," you know?
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.080]   Number four, the voice comes again on the intercom system,
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.280]   "Would you please stand forward?"
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.520]   I mean, he just stands there, he doesn't do anything,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.680]   he doesn't even move, doesn't even entwitch
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.600]   and we're all standing there,
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.840]   kind of like beginning to look a little confused
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.640]   and staring in the mirror at him.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.080]   "Number four, would you please stand forward?"
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.760]   And we're like, "Come on, guy, number four, stand..."
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.520]   "Number four!"
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.120]   And I suddenly realized I'm holding number four
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.880]   and I stood in the wrong place in number three.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.160]   And I'm standing there and I'm thinking,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.680]   "Hang on a sec, whoever is behind there
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.880]   "has just called me out.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.720]   "He's so obviously guilty, but I'm the one."
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.280]   And again, "Number four, would you please stand forward?"
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.840]   And I can tell this guy's standing there
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.120]   looking at me in the mirror like,
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.560]   "You can help me get off right now.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.720]   "Stand forward!"
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.840]   I stand forward.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.560]   Okay, honest story, this is what happens.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.480]   As I stand forward,
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.640]   automatically something goes through my mind.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.040]   Here's what I think, I go, "Did I really do it?"
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.560]   Like, where was I on October 25th?
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.400]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.760]   Like, maybe I did it and I completely forgot about it.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.560]   What is the crime that maybe I had...
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.480]   And I literally began to absorb the identity
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.760]   that the witness behind the mirror was saying about me.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.720]   For whatever reason,
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.080]   they thought I looked like the person who had done it.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.560]   And I stepped forward and I was like,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.040]   "Perhaps I actually did."
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.640]   I allowed just the pressure of that moment
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   and everything kind of cloud my mind.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.160]   And I began to feel really guilty about something
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.200]   that I didn't know that maybe I had done.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.080]   Then the thing says, "Okay, stand back."
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.320]   So I stood back.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   Then the lights went off, that was it.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.760]   The lights went off, the door opens, they come,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.040]   they take the guy away,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.360]   and then a police officer comes into the room
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   and arrests me.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.760]   Okay, I'm embellishing a little bit about that part.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.440]   He didn't actually come in and arrest me.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.280]   But he did come in and say,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.560]   "Sir, we need to take you to this room over here
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.080]   and we need to interview and find out
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.920]   where were you on October 25th?
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.520]   And do you actually have an alibi for your presence?"
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.040]   Now, I hadn't done it, I wasn't in the place,
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.720]   I had an alibi, it was all code.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.440]   So guys, just trust me, I didn't do whatever it was, okay?
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.520]   But when I left that place that day,
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.680]   here's the thought processes that were going around my mind.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.800]   I realized how easy it was for someone
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.720]   to give me an identity
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.960]   and for me to absorb and take on that identity.
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.280]   Like it was so easy to have somebody's voice
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.520]   that I didn't even know,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.360]   begin to shape what I actually thought about myself.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.600]   Did I really do it?
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.800]   And I realized that our identity is so tentative,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.880]   that our identity can be so molded and shaped
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.640]   by other people's perspective.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.880]   And as I left it that day,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.520]   I was beginning to ask myself some new questions.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.000]   Like what actually does form our identity?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.640]   Like who is it that is actually shaping
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.240]   and telling us who we are?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.600]   Because so often it's the external voice from us
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.040]   that is shaping and telling us who we are.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.000]   Years later, as I've come to faith,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.800]   I've asked those questions in a Christian way.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.400]   Like I know my identity should be in Christ Jesus.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.720]   I know it should be in the gospel,
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.520]   the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.080]   But I also recognize like that day,
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.120]   there are many voices that come to me from social media,
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.200]   from movies, from music, from politicians,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.200]   from influential people in society,
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.600]   from even well-meaning friends
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.440]   that are telling me how I should live,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.520]   how I should be shaped, who I should be.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.600]   And I realized that I so often lifted
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.680]   into the voices out there
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.600]   rather than the voice that the Holy Spirit has put in here.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   And I end up shaping much of my life
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.440]   more around the external voice of others
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.160]   rather than the internal voice of God.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.320]   And I realize now that I'm asking other questions
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.600]   about my identity.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.840]   I'm asking questions like this,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.440]   like what brokenness is there in my identity?
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.320]   Recognizing that other voices have a profound impact,
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.520]   what voices are there in my identity
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.000]   that need to be uprooted and changed?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.880]   Like what are the things that the Holy Spirit
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.200]   wants to reestablish in me
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.440]   so that my identity is more rooted in the gospel,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.440]   the life, death and resurrection of Jesus?
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.760]   Are you with me?
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.120]   Now, this is exactly what was on Paul's heart
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.040]   as he opens his letter to the church in Philippi.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.240]   He wants to, through his opening 11 verses,
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.120]   and we're gonna look at the first six today,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.000]   he wants to reestablish for his church right at the start
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.640]   how they should think about themselves and about God.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.440]   Because he realizes that their identity
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.880]   has been shaken recently.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.720]   You remember last week,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.000]   if you were here as part of our opening message,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.640]   and if you weren't, I encourage you to go online
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.600]   and check it out, but last week,
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.000]   I mentioned two critical things
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.600]   about the church in Philippi.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.480]   First of all, I told us that they were a church
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.240]   under great persecution.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.920]   The gospel of Caesar and the gospel of Jesus had clashed.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.360]   And Paul knew that many of them there were struggling with,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.120]   do I honor Caesar or do I honor God?
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.160]   And if those things come into conflict, what do I do?
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.520]   And because of that,
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.040]   the church itself had become under persecution.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.320]   There was heavy persecution of the church in Philippi.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.240]   The second thing about the church there
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.120]   is their division amongst themselves.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.080]   I said last week that as the persecution increased,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.880]   the church was beginning to kind of head
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.360]   a little bit like this.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.720]   There were different factions
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.440]   that were beginning to grow up in the church,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.600]   different people with different perspectives and opinions,
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.800]   and the church was not unified together.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.280]   It was beginning to become more divided.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.960]   And Paul understood as he's writing to the church,
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.200]   as he's opening the letter,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.800]   he knows that their identity has been shaken
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.360]   by the persecution,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.240]   as well as by the divisions amongst themselves.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.160]   And he realizes some things need to be uprooted
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.640]   and some things need to be firmly established.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.640]   The church needs to understand who they truly are.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.000]   So his opening prayer in the book
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.360]   is a prayer to reestablish the roots of their identity.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.040]   You're with me so far?
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.520]   Now, here's why this is important.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.840]   'Cause I don't know about you,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   but I know me and I know that I recognize the inward door
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.120]   that I want to open to the Holy Spirit
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.080]   like we sung about during our worship time,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.000]   needs to open up
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.440]   because I do recognize some brokenness in me.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.240]   I do recognize some areas where my identity
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.320]   is not as it should be.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.840]   And I wonder if that's resonating
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.760]   with anyone else in this room.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.200]   And if it is, then my prayer for us,
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.600]   as Paul's prayer was for his church,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.880]   that I pray for you today
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.560]   as we open up this passage of scriptures,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.640]   that God would begin to speak about your identity afresh
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.160]   and establish in you some new, wonderful, beautiful things.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.000]   Can we pray?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.880]   Father, I just ask that you would open this word
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.200]   to us this morning.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.080]   We thank you that Paul had a passion for the church,
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   passion for his people,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.040]   and that he taught us much about prayer.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.600]   And as we think about what it is to pray as a church
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.280]   together today in our identity in you,
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.640]   would you come and speak to us in Jesus' name?
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.840]   And we'll say this.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.400]   Let me read to you the first six verses of Philippians.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.000]   Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.440]   to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.640]   together with the overseers and the deacons,
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.800]   grace and peace to you from our God, the Father,
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.880]   and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.680]   I thank my God every time I remember you.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.280]   In all my prayers for all of you,
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.460]   I always pray with joy
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.200]   because of our partnership in the gospel,
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.720]   from the first day until now,
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.880]   being confident of this,
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.280]   that he who began a good work in you
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.280]   will carry it on to completion
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.840]   until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.360]   Paul writes to the church,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.280]   and immediately he wants to,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.880]   after he's introduced himself and he's addressed them
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.560]   and said grace and peace over them,
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.880]   from verse three and four,
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.320]   he immediately brings an intimacy to them in this letter.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   He says, "I thank God for you."
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.360]   He says, "I'm always remembering you in my prayers.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.340]   "I pray for all of you.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.240]   "There's a great joy in me as I pray."
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.160]   It's like Paul is saying,
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.920]   "Man, I am so intimately, personally loving towards you.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.960]   "I mean, I can't help but thank God,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.160]   "rejoice for you, remember you,
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.680]   "pray for you all the time."
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.440]   Paul is being very intimate and very direct.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.240]   Now, you have to remember,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.160]   Paul is writing this from a place
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.760]   of being in chains in prison.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.040]   In other words, Paul is writing this
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.000]   not when everything is going great for Paul.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.980]   And I don't know about you and I,
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.640]   but when things are not going great for me
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.280]   and somebody says, "What's your prayer life like?"
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.840]   I'm like, "Oh man, I need you to pray for me.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.280]   "Things are hard for me.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.520]   "Things are going bad.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.480]   "Oh, I'm in chains for the gospel.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.160]   "Would you pray, church, that God would break the..."
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.800]   Paul doesn't do that.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.020]   I want you to see this.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.560]   When he thinks about prayer,
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.160]   he thinks about praying for others.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.000]   He writes to them,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.480]   even though he's in a really hard situation,
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.880]   and he celebrates, and he says,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.160]   "I'm praying for you always,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.760]   "and I have great joy in my heart.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.200]   "And I just thank God that you're alive
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.120]   "and that you're committed
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.720]   "and that you're together in this church."
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.240]   And it's a beautiful thing.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.560]   Paul is modeling something for us.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.120]   He's showing the church a new way to pray.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.080]   And I wonder if the Holy Spirit came
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.240]   and did an audit of your prayer life,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.600]   what might emerge?
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.680]   If you're anything like me,
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.080]   your prayer life is probably predominantly about you
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.960]   and maybe your immediate family,
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.240]   the things that really matter.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.040]   It's like a laundry list of all the stuff
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.400]   that you might want God to do in your life.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.840]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.960]   That kind of prayer is great.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.800]   It's important.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.620]   It's throughout the Bible.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.040]   We should pray for one another.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.400]   We should pray for ourselves.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.840]   That's absolutely fine.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.680]   But Paul is saying,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.240]   if you really truly wanna be the church together,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.400]   you need to shift your prayer life
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.200]   from being just about a laundry list
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.920]   of all the things that you want God to do for you
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   and begin to shift it towards what it means
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.760]   to actually thank God for one another.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.280]   He's saying, "I don't just do these things for you.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.420]   "I'm modeling how you should be for each other.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.380]   "You should thank God for one another.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.220]   "You should find joy when you think about each other.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.120]   "You should actually want the blessings
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.760]   "and the welfare of one another."
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.920]   And I think one of the reasons
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.960]   why Paul is starting his prayer with this
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.640]   is that he's trying to say something to them
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.800]   about their division and their disunity.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.680]   Come on, church, note this.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.200]   It's so hard to remain hateful and hardened
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.640]   towards those that you genuinely are thanking God for,
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.020]   towards those that you genuinely want God
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.880]   to give His blessings for their welfare and their growth.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.960]   It's really hard to stay divided to those
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.360]   that you genuinely out of joy want the best for them.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.560]   Are you with me?
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.440]   But here's a church where they were struggling.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.960]   They were heading in this direction.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.720]   They were probably, it was probably difficult for them
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.880]   at times to be in the same room as one another.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.360]   And Paul's saying, "Shift your prayer life
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.240]   "away from yourself towards the genuine affection
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.160]   "for the other."
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.240]   If you wanna break dividing walls,
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.320]   move in the opposite spirit
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.120]   to what those walls are saying to you.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.400]   Say, "Lord, even though I find this person difficult,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.440]   "Lord, even though they've hurt me,
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.860]   "Father, I am so grateful you created them.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.120]   "And I know, Lord, that you're doing something in them.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.000]   "And Father, I pray a blessing over them."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.920]   Could you imagine how that might revolutionize
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.880]   a broken church if people truly prayed that way?
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.200]   A few years ago, there was a person here at the Vine
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.520]   who caused me a lot of personal anxiety,
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.380]   stress, emotional pain.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.840]   And I was walking with this person every season.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.880]   It was incredibly difficult.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.720]   And I felt a darkness in me towards that person.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.920]   I struggled to be a Christian towards them,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.640]   let alone a pastor towards them.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.480]   Are you with me?
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.520]   And right in the midst of that season,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.480]   God came and said, "Andrew, I want you
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.040]   "to thank God for them."
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.900]   I'm like, "No way.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.160]   "There's no way I'm gonna thank God for this person.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.540]   "I want to get this person.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.020]   "I wanna do a lot of things for this person,
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.240]   "but not to thank you for them."
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.800]   He's like, "I want you to thank God for them,
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.060]   "and not just thank God for them,
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.580]   "but I also want you to pray my blessings over them.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.240]   "I've got so much I wanna do in them,
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.540]   "so much I wanna give them.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.320]   "Would you partner with me in praying thanksgiving
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.720]   "and blessing over them?"
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.780]   And I tell you, it was not easy.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.880]   I rebelled against the obedience instruction
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.940]   of the Lord many times in that area.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:35.040]   But as I began to say, "Lord, okay, Lord,"
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.460]   day one, it was like, "Lord, thank you for them.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.300]   "Just bless them."
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.120]   (congregation laughing)
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.300]   Day two was better.
[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.400]   Day three, day five, day 20,
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.560]   "Lord, I sense something in my spirit for them."
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.600]   And I began to pray almost daily for this person,
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.800]   and I felt something happen in me.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.880]   I don't know whatever happened in them,
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.080]   but I know something happened in me.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.720]   You know sometimes when God moves mountains,
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.080]   they're not in the people we're praying for.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.880]   They're actually moved in us.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.200]   And I felt like this shift and this change in who I was,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.080]   and I felt myself more gracious and loving and kind.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.840]   And my interactions with this person also changed,
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.200]   because not because, again, they changed particularly
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.080]   or the situation changed particularly,
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.220]   but because something inside of me shifted.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.800]   A dividing wall came down because I was thankful
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.000]   and I was seeking the welfare of the one
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.700]   that I was at amnesty against.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.680]   Are you with me?
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.040]   You do this, and it's a supernatural,
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.720]   prophetic breaking down of the walls.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.280]   Oh, what church might look like if it did more of that.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.520]   Paul then goes on in verse five, and he says,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.080]   "Because you are partnering together."
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.640]   I thank God for our partnership in the gospel.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.920]   This is a beautiful word, this partnership.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.720]   In the Greek, it's the same root word as koinonia,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.560]   which is fellowship.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.480]   This is Paul saying about fellowship,
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.760]   but this particular word actually emphasizes more
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.320]   the working together with another, which is amazing,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.200]   'cause Paul's essentially saying that true fellowship,
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.440]   true koinonia is not just meeting together,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.780]   it is also working together.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:10.520]   That actually committing ourselves to work together
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.800]   towards a shared vision is as much on God's heart
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.400]   when he talks about fellowship as it is for us
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.280]   just to come together and know each other
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.680]   and enjoy being in relationship with one another.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.640]   So Paul, fellowship, meeting, also had a purpose.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.000]   And remember, Paul is saying there's a partnership
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.160]   we take place with in the gospel,
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.640]   and he's thanking them for their partnership
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.740]   because they as a church had partnered with him
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.880]   in his gospel.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.140]   They had actually financially provided for him.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.120]   They had sent this guy, one of the leaders from the church
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.440]   called Ephroditus, to come and minister to him
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.240]   whilst he was in prison.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.080]   The church in Philippi had been very generous towards Paul.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.400]   He says, "There's a partnership that's happening here."
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.680]   But he's not just thanking them for the finance
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.120]   and for the material support he had received.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.280]   He's again, modeling what prayer might look like.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.760]   And he's like, "Here's how you pray for one another,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.700]   "that you're not just thankful for each other.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.920]   "You're not just wanting the best
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.400]   "and pray blessing on each other,
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.020]   "but there is a prayer that you would work well together
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.720]   "for the gospel."
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.600]   Because there is something that the gospel
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.120]   is trying to do in this time.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.240]   There's a work of the gospel, God's spirit and presence.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.680]   This is an alternative society planted in the wider society.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.360]   You're not just a holy huddle on a Sunday,
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.040]   Paul is saying to the church.
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.160]   When you come together, it's also not just to meet together,
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.000]   but it's to roll up your sleeves and say,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.960]   "What is it that we are to do together
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.080]   "with a shared vision and a shared passion
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.200]   "for the gospel in our city?"
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.480]   'Cause there's lots of people out there
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.920]   that need to know Jesus.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.580]   And if all we ever do under these beautiful lights
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.880]   and in this beautiful building is to sing praise songs,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.640]   but we never actually then go out
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.360]   and reach out with the gospel,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.480]   Paul would say, "That's not fellowship."
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.400]   This is an important word for us
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.800]   in our time here in Hong Kong in this season.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.960]   'Cause I don't know about you, man,
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.360]   but I love the church, right?
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.040]   It's kind of my job, but I love it, I really do.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.720]   And I have survived in the last two, three years
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.880]   here in Hong Kong because I get to come
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.520]   and do this with you.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.400]   I mean, the times of restoration and healing,
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.560]   times where the week has been so hard for me
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.320]   that I just fall over the precipice
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.520]   of the door on the Sunday.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.240]   And I'm like, "Thank God I can shut the world out
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.480]   "for 90 minutes and just spend time
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.200]   "with people I love."
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.400]   Right, are you with me?
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.160]   Like, it's great that the church
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.960]   is a healing hospital for us.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.520]   It's great that the church is available for us in that way.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.920]   It should be always that way.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.100]   But here's the problem.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.040]   In times of persecution, in times of hardship,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.140]   in times of suffering, it's very easy for the church
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.440]   to be tempted to only fellowship in meeting together
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.600]   and completely forget about the outreach
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.160]   that it has been called to do.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.040]   You see, in hard and overwhelming times,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.040]   for a church, we must remember that the church
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.760]   is not just a place to meet together.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.560]   It's not just a place of respite.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.260]   It is also a place of outreach.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.920]   Are you with me, everyone?
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.480]   And as we button that down in our thinking
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.820]   and in our identity, when we pray thanksgiving
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.320]   for one another, when we pray a blessing over one another,
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.180]   it's not just so that we can have reconciled relationships
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.900]   in this space right now.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.140]   It's so that in partnership together,
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.500]   we can work better together.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.460]   You see, Paul wants them reconciled.
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.420]   He wants their dividing walls broken down,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.260]   not just so that they can hug each other more,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.760]   but so that they can be a more effective witness
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.740]   of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.660]   in society around them.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.120]   Because if the world looks in on the messiness of this
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.560]   with all our cultures and backgrounds
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.620]   and all the fact that we have different political views
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.800]   and all of those things, if the world looks in on this
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.080]   and sees us loving each other, working together,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.560]   praying together, breaking down dividing walls,
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.560]   and then actually as one unit moving out
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.120]   with hope and joy to the world,
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.240]   the world will see that and go, "That's different."
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.000]   There's something tremendously exciting in that.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.340]   So Paul invites the church to also pray
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.300]   about their partnership with one another in the gospel.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.820]   Could you imagine what it would be like to be a church
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.800]   that prayed like that?
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.340]   Now, we get to the really meaty part,
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.740]   the bit that I'm really excited about.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.580]   Are you ready?
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:26.660]   Verse six, he says this, "Being confident of this,
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.020]   that he who began a good work in you
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.180]   will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus."
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.560]   This is Paul shifting now to talk about their identity
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.280]   and the reality that their identity was being shaken.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.200]   And he wants to speak into the very root of who they are
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.360]   and the very root of the kind of God
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.240]   that they should believe in.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.000]   Let me preach on this for a second by framing it like this.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.080]   I think we're living in a time and in a society
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.240]   and a community right now in the world
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.160]   that has major commitment issues.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.120]   I don't know if you've felt like this yourself,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.840]   but I think we're living in a time
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.980]   where we're so used to scrolling so quickly
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.860]   through social media onto the next fix,
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.980]   onto the next fix, the next video, the next photo,
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.220]   the next thing that's happening,
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.780]   that we're beginning to take that
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.000]   and applying it into the jobs that we have,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.260]   the relationships that we have, the marriages that we have.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.780]   And we're becoming a society
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.940]   that is letting go of commitment,
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.380]   letting go of standing on our word.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.660]   And actually our own personal selfish desires
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.740]   are taking precedent over the word
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.680]   that we might've given to someone.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.180]   Because we're so used to finding the next thing
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.500]   that satisfies that we now, even in our external world,
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.900]   are desperately often looking for the next thing
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:41.740]   that satisfies.
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.460]   And when we're in a relationship,
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.420]   when we're in a workplace and things get a little tense,
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.500]   things get a little difficult,
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.980]   maybe there's a little bump in the road,
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.540]   we're very quick at the moment
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.420]   to just let go of that thing and move on to the next thing.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.620]   See, we have a commitment issue, I believe,
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.900]   because we have a perspective issue.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.000]   You see, we're so quick to give up on something
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.260]   because we so often judge that thing
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:11.260]   based on its present reality rather than its future finish.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.620]   We judge it on all of the stuff
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.940]   that's happening in that moment
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.460]   rather than being able to stand back
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.700]   and see that there's a trajectory of this thing
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.060]   that is actually going somewhere else.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.620]   We judge one another
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.680]   because of the place in the journey that we're in
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.980]   rather than actually looking
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.620]   that we're actually on a journey.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.260]   We judge each other by what we see in front of us
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.380]   rather than in the grander picture
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.860]   of what the Holy Spirit might be doing within us.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.180]   And when that happens,
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.940]   we find ourselves letting go of our commitments,
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.460]   just giving up on stuff just quickly.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.980]   And I think one of the reasons we do it
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.480]   is because we wanna avoid suffering and hardship.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.780]   Like if this thing we're doing right here,
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.000]   if that's gonna be hard, man,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.220]   I don't know if I want anything hard.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.560]   It's already hard enough to live.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.240]   I don't know if I want extra hardness.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.020]   I'm just gonna let that one go.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.300]   And I think as Christians,
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.440]   we have a real dangerous thing that we do.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.700]   I think we actually over-spiritualize things sometimes.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.020]   And we kind of go, "Man, I got into this
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.540]   'cause I thought God called me into it.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.620]   And oh yeah, he gave me those confirming signs
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.860]   and those confirming words.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.420]   And I started it, but you know, it got really hard.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.700]   And I realized that it was hard
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.400]   because God wasn't in it anymore."
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.340]   And we suddenly over-spiritualize our struggles
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.580]   and our suffering with the reality
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.940]   that God must not be there.
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.060]   God's lifted His grace.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.500]   God's not involved in this anymore.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.980]   So, "Well, I'll go and do the next thing."
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.500]   When actually God's word is firm and true.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.860]   He's a faithful God.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.420]   So Paul writes to the church,
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.020]   a church that I think was deeply struggling with this,
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.380]   and he begins to speak into them.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.420]   He says, "Don't judge something
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.500]   on what it looks like right now.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.340]   You need to realize that the Holy Spirit
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.500]   is moving everything towards this glorious day
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.100]   when Christ will return.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.940]   And if God started it,
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.700]   He will be in it and He will complete it."
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.540]   Let me give you a sense of this by showing you a photograph.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:06.540]   This photograph was taken on the 23rd of December, 1997.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.980]   That's me, by the way, in the photograph.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.780]   Can you see the long hair?
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.860]   Look at this, long hair.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.660]   I don't know what my sideburns are doing,
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.060]   but they're getting real long there.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.700]   Those glasses, I think I might've borrowed them from my dad.
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.540]   I don't know.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.620]   Those glasses are not cool.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.120]   I'm wearing this really baggy suit.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.180]   This is like '90s ugliness right there on a photo for you.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.100]   Here's the thing.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.360]   This is my engagement night.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:36.100]   And I am so, so glad that my wife, Christine,
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:39.580]   did not decide to answer my question to her,
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.860]   "Will you marry me?"
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.580]   based on how I looked in that moment.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.340]   I am so glad that she saw
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.740]   that there was a better future ahead
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.100]   than what was happening right now.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.900]   I'm so glad that she knew I was like a fine wine,
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.140]   that I would get better ahead.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.200]   I'm so glad that she didn't look at that hair
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.040]   and look at those sideburns,
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.020]   but she looked at the character
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.780]   and the integrity and the future.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.420]   And she said, "I wanna be a part of that
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.340]   "because the trajectory where it's going is good,
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.940]   "even if right now you look like this."
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.860]   And I think God is, through Paul speaking to the church
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.440]   in Philippi, a church under great persecution,
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.100]   a church under division within them.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.660]   And Paul understands that if we're giving up on one another,
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.860]   the next phase is that we start to give up on God.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.300]   And so when God doesn't answer that prayer
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.180]   in the time we thought, he's not faithful.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.500]   When God doesn't act in the way we want him to do,
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.860]   I guess he's not faithful.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.780]   I think the church in Philippi was looking at Paul
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.560]   and they were seeing that the one that they loved,
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.060]   their mentor, their pastor,
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.580]   the one that was so much more spiritual than they'll ever be,
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.620]   he was in prison.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.380]   And they're thinking, "If that's my future in the gospel,
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.340]   "I don't know if this thing was such a great idea."
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.060]   And Paul writes them and he says,
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.200]   "This is where our confidence is.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.000]   "This is where our identity gets formed.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.140]   "This is in who we are."
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.100]   We do not judge based on what we see right now.
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.900]   We do not allow the persecution.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.220]   We do not allow the division
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.300]   to begin to define who we are right now.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.520]   Instead, we recognize that if God started this
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.220]   in the beginning, if his presence, if he planted it,
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.700]   if he renewed it, if he was the one who spoke into it,
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.700]   then no matter what might happen,
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.020]   God will carry it through
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.140]   on order so that it would be completed
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.140]   on the day of his glorious return.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.060]   He jumps forward to what he's gonna say in verse 10,
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.140]   where he says, "On that day,
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.860]   "we will be pure and blameless before the Lord."
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.260]   And he's saying, "Get a pure and blameless future vision
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.500]   "for the brokenness of the current."
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.820]   That's how you should pray.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.220]   We should be able to give each other much more grace,
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.100]   give each other much more release
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.380]   than the reality of what we're seeing.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.580]   He said, "There's a good work in you."
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.460]   Don't forget it.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.700]   No matter how hard the situation might be,
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.620]   there's a good work in you.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:56.820]   When Paul speaks of good works,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.540]   he's speaking here predominantly of two things,
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.820]   the good work of their conversion
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.740]   through the Holy Spirit in Jesus, the gospel.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.940]   He's speaking about that moment
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.820]   when they gave their life to Jesus.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.140]   He said, "That moment didn't happen because you did it.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.860]   "It happened because God started it in you.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.860]   "It's a good work."
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.740]   And then he's talking about
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.380]   the ongoing sanctification process
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.780]   that would lead them to the time when Jesus comes back,
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.620]   this ongoing work of renewal where we give up our spirit,
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.980]   we give our sin to Him, we repent and we come before Him,
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.500]   and we do all of that kind of work.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.100]   All of that is part of this other good work
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.620]   that He sustains in us as He brings us to the time
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.860]   when He'll return to judge the world
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.900]   and we will be before Him in a place of pureness
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:41.740]   and blamelessness, and it's wonderful.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.580]   And Paul's saying, "Get this perspective
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.340]   "when you pray, it's a good work."
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.820]   Notice, he doesn't say it's an easy work.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.140]   Doesn't say even it's a fun work.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.340]   Doesn't even say it's a work that's going to be a blessing
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.060]   to all your needs and your wants and your desires.
[00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:04.260]   But he says it's an eternal work of good in you.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:08.020]   And that good work sometimes requires hard work on our part.
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.940]   It sometimes requires repentance
[00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.500]   as much as it requires prayers for blessing.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.060]   Sometimes requires us to give up things
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.540]   rather than hold on to the broken.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.780]   Sometimes it requires us to have that conversation,
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.300]   to humble ourselves, to say, "Will you forgive me?"
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.060]   Sometimes the work that is good in God's eyes
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.140]   requires something that might be tough in ours.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.260]   But just 'cause it's tough doesn't mean God has given up.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.820]   That's what He's saying to the church.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.540]   It might be hard at times, but it's a good work.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.580]   And here's the thing.
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.580]   If God started it, you can take two things to the bank.
[00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.140]   It's a good work and it will be completed.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:52.620]   Imagine what it would mean to pray like that.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.380]   Which is exactly why Paul then brings it
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.860]   all the way back to what he started with,
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:57.660]   division amongst them.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.140]   And he says, "Man, if God starts it,
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.100]   if God's gonna be there every step of the way,
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.140]   if God's gonna complete it,
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.540]   then you need to get that prayerful perspective in your mind
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.300]   as you are trying to be the body of Christ together."
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.300]   See, this is me, not Paul.
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.700]   But I think there is so much division
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.980]   and disunity in the church
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.540]   because we have a tendency in us to judge one another,
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:24.460]   not on the confidence of how we're going to appear
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.800]   on that glorious day when Christ returns,
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.860]   but on the reality of our human brokenness
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.500]   in the present along the way.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.540]   That's what we judge.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.820]   We look upon one another and we hurt one another
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.980]   and we do things and we're sinful as human beings
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.100]   and we look at that and we say,
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.780]   "That person's never gonna amount to anything.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.620]   I don't even know if that person's a Christian."
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.220]   And we judge one another.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.740]   And that judgment of our present reality of our sin
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.500]   is what causes the deeper divisions amongst us.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.540]   And Paul says, "You wanna know how to pray.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.820]   Pray that you are thankful for every person
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.220]   within your community of faith.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.980]   Pray that God will bless each person.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.820]   Pray that you'll be able to partner better for the gospel,
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.820]   being confident of this,
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.180]   that if God has started a good work in that person,
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.420]   if God has their hand on them,
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.660]   then he will be with them every step of the way.
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.140]   And they're not gonna look perfect.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.500]   They're still gonna upset you.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.520]   They're gonna do things that are gonna hurt you,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.540]   but he is in it.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.580]   He will bring them to a place of pureness and blamelessness
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.220]   on the return of Christ Jesus.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.020]   It is not your place to judge.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.300]   It is your place to love."
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.580]   That's what church looks like, Paul is saying.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.020]   You wanna know how to pray?
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.140]   Pray like that.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.380]   Ain't that beautiful?
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.580]   And as we lean into praying like that,
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:44.420]   we might then begin to have this release in us
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.620]   that we are actually an alternative society
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.940]   that doesn't just say it loves, but truly does.
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.060]   It doesn't just say that we like to come together,
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.500]   but we truly do love to come together.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.580]   It doesn't just say that we're working together
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.420]   for the gospel,
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.740]   but we're actually working together for the gospel.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.260]   'Cause our identity is not rooted in our situation.
[00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.940]   It's not rooted in the suffering.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.500]   It's not rooted in the things that are happening to us
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.020]   and those things causing us like that moment for me to go,
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.060]   am I really that person?
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.620]   Instead, our identity is rooted on a God.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.500]   We are confident of this God,
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.620]   that if he starts it, it's good, and he will finish it.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:23.460]   In Jesus' name.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.300]   - Amen.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.140]   - Amen.
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:25.960]   Can we stand together?
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.980]   I wanna read a prayer over us.
[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.500]   We're gonna read it together actually.
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.060]   And it's a prayer that this passage leads us to.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.780]   If this was not COVID times,
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.020]   I would have us holding hands, linking arms,
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.580]   but the introverts in the room are very happy
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.400]   that this is COVID.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.260]   So we're gonna read this out loud together
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.340]   as our prayer as a congregation.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.180]   So let's read it together.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.180]   Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.180]   We are a part of your family together.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.780]   We thank you for this church and for our fellowship.
[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.980]   We thank you for your faithfulness and love.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.280]   We pray for each other now.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.780]   May we find joy in each other.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.180]   May we find gospel partnership in each other.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.840]   May we carry each other in our hearts
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.780]   and share God's grace with each other.
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.540]   May we be quick to love and slow to judge.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.640]   May we know the affection of Jesus Christ
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.000]   and his joy for one another.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.620]   And through this all, may we grow together,
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.100]   being confident that he who began a good work in us
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.800]   will carry it on to completion.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.700]   Father, we just come before you now,
[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:40.420]   grateful for this type of church
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.700]   that you're building amongst us,
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.660]   an alternative society that prays in new ways.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.220]   Father, we don't just look at the church in Philippi
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.220]   as a divided church.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.000]   We recognize so often the enemy gets into our churches today,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.460]   gets into this church, creates division and disunity.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.060]   Lord, that breaks our hearts.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.900]   And Father, we recognize that that doesn't just happen here,
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.220]   but it also happens in the wider spheres of our lives
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.180]   with relationships and families and colleagues.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:15.020]   I wanna just take a moment as we respond now in ministry
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.820]   to let the Holy Spirit speak to you.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.020]   Perhaps there's some relationships in your lives.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.060]   Perhaps there's some things
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:24.220]   that you've got a commitment issue towards.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.020]   Maybe you're looking for the next great thing
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.100]   and the Holy Spirit's saying, "I started that."
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.340]   And it might not guarantee that it'll be easy,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.900]   but it is good and it will be completed in you.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.340]   And so some of you, maybe it's the Holy Spirit
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.100]   just promptly and soberly just tugging on your heart today
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.980]   to reestablish your commitment to what He's called you to.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.460]   Perhaps there's some of you in this room
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.260]   where you know that there's brokenness
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.140]   between you and others.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.060]   Maybe that's a brokenness that you've created and sustained
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.140]   or maybe it's been created and sustained towards you.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.500]   If it's happened towards you, I wanna encourage you
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.020]   to maybe pray a new way as you go forward,
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.460]   to pray that prayer of thankfulness
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.100]   and blessing for that person.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.620]   It's not gonna be easy for you,
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.460]   but it is an invitation to open the door inwards,
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.300]   allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you in that
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.300]   as you spiritually and supernaturally
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.420]   walk in the opposite spirit.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.980]   And if you're the one that's perhaps caused that pain
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.060]   or that division outwardly,
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.660]   then today's a chance just to come
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.300]   and ask the Holy Spirit to minister to you too.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.980]   Just to bring your heart before Him
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.740]   and ask Him to forgive you,
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.980]   ask Him to show how you can make reconciliation
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.020]   for that person, what it might be
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.100]   that you're being called to do
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.260]   by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.420]   in the weeks and the months ahead.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.140]   Lord, however you need us to respond this morning,
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.900]   would you come by your Holy Spirit?
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.480]   (gentle music)
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.060]   (gentle music)
