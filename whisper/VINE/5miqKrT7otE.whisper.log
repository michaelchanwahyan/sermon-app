[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   Amen, amen, awesome.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.400]   Have a seat, please, have a seat.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.000]   Well, welcome to the Vine if this is your relatively new time or if this is kind of
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   like one of your first times.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.800]   We're so grateful you're here.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.480]   This is our 11 o'clock service.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.800]   We have three services on a Sunday, 9, 15, 11, and 2.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.920]   We're very, very, very full at the 11 o'clock.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.360]   In fact, we've got a huge overflow happening at the moment and there's probably not a spare.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.440]   But if you do have a seat next to you, could you just put your hand up?
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.240]   There are some people standing around the sides here.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.120]   So if you do have a seat next to you, there's one right at the front over here.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.840]   There's one in the back over here.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.120]   We really appreciate it.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.480]   We don't want anyone having to stand, but we recognize that there's a bunch of people
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.960]   standing in the upper house and the lower house.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.480]   So if there's a possible seat next to you or if somebody just doesn't mind like sharing
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.000]   a seat, you know, bum on each part of the seat, we're a community here together.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.080]   Okay, maybe don't do that.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.000]   All right, Ellison's giving up his seat.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Come on, let's hear it for Ellison.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   What a man.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   You can sit with Justin.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Ellison's giving up his seat.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.240]   Okay, we need one person for this seat.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.280]   Otherwise it's going to look really weird in the video because there's going to be like
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.640]   an empty seat right here.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840]   Ellison, we need you back in that seat if no one else is going to sit in that seat.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.840]   My name is Andrew.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.840]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   We're grateful that you're here.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.880]   We've been in this series on the Holy Spirit over the last little while.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.200]   And then this week and the next week, we're going to be focusing now on the work of the
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   Spirit.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.760]   And I'm really excited because we want to do a couple of things with you today.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.760]   I want to teach you a little bit around the work of the Spirit, which I'll do in a moment.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.200]   But the most important thing that's going to happen today is we're actually going to
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.080]   pray and we're going to make space for the work of the Spirit for each one of us here.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.080]   And that's going to be personal.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.520]   It'll be corporate.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.200]   But we really want to make space today.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.000]   So that's why we've set up a little bit differently.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.120]   That's why we're going to have time.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.880]   That's why we cut our worship a little bit shorter than we normally do because we want
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.840]   to emphasize ministry of the Holy Spirit on each one of us today.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.240]   That's both Upper House, Lower House, in the overflow.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.440]   And if you're joining us online right now, we're so grateful you're sitting at home somewhere
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   wearing your pajamas maybe, just chilling out at home.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.600]   We're glad that you're here with us as well.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.440]   And we pray that this and what we do today will also really reach you and minister to
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.480]   you where you're at.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.280]   In order to kind of unpack what I want to do with you guys, I want to start by having
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.280]   you guys do something.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.520]   So I want you to start by thinking about when was the last time you experienced the personal
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.960]   work of the Holy Spirit for you?
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.400]   When was the last time you had a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit?
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.160]   For some of you, you're like, "Just two minutes ago during worship," which is great.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.040]   But maybe for many of us, maybe it's another time.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   But have a think.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.240]   When was the last time you had a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit and what was
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240]   it like?
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.200]   Think about that.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.160]   Now I would hazard a guess that for the majority of us in this room, when we pause for a moment
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.800]   to think about, "Okay, when was the last time I had a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit?"
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.680]   The natural tendency is maybe to think about some of the dramatic kind of manifestations
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   of the Spirit.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.800]   So we kind of automatically begin to think about, "Oh yeah, that time when somebody prayed
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.160]   for me and I felt like kind of bolts of lightning through my body," or, "Somebody prayed for
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.640]   me and I felt all warm inside," or, "Actually, there was that moment when I was praying for
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.440]   somebody at the service last weekend and I could see that the Holy Spirit was doing something
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.980]   on them and it just felt amazing."
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.720]   Or maybe it was a time where you had a headache and you prayed and suddenly your headache
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   went.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.400]   Or maybe you were with someone and they had something going on in their lives and a group
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.120]   of people prayed for them and you saw a miracle take place.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.160]   I think when we often think about the work of the Holy Spirit, when we think about that
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.640]   as an encounter for us, it's easy for us to think about these dramatic moments where the
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.900]   Spirit does something external to us that is incredible to see.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.440]   And those are, of course, very much the work of the Spirit.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.520]   But here's a fascinating thing.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.640]   When you open up the New Testament in particular and you look at the theology and the teaching
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.340]   around the Spirit, particularly in the work of Paul as he's writing to the church, predominantly
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.800]   what is spoken about when the work of the Spirit is spoken about is, yes, it is the
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   external manifestations.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.000]   I mean, we see those in the ministry of Jesus, of course, and the miracles in which he did.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.800]   And then in the early church, we know that there was gifts of the Spirit that was poured
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   out.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.760]   And, of course, that external stuff was at work.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.320]   But Paul, predominantly, when he's speaking about the Spirit and its work, he talks differently.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.800]   He says, actually, the Spirit does its primary work within us.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.280]   The slow at times, sometimes imperceptible changes that happen within us, that the Spirit
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.000]   by its fruit comes and changes us and turns us into people who are more patient, people
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.360]   who have more joy, people that find more love coming from us.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.400]   And yes, there are the dramatic moments where the Spirit comes and does what only the Spirit
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.560]   can do, these miraculous things that I think, particularly for us charismatic Christians,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.880]   that's kind of something that we long for and look for.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:09.400]   But actually, it's the internal, quiet, step-by-step, life-transforming work of the Spirit that
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.040]   the New Testament particularly celebrates.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.880]   In fact, it is these two things, and I want you to think about this, it is the external
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.720]   manifestations of the Spirit and the internal transformation by the Spirit that are the
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.080]   totality of His work.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.600]   Are you following this?
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.120]   Here's the tendency I think we have as Christians, is that when we see that the work of the Spirit
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.280]   is both of these things, the problem is, though, if you're anything like me, you can have a
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.600]   bias towards one of them.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.240]   And that bias might be for a number of reasons.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.220]   There may be one of these sides, whether the external manifestation or the internal transformation,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.800]   that we naturally find ourselves leaning more towards, wanting perhaps more or perhaps more
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.840]   comfortable with than the other.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:06.080]   Perhaps for some of you in this room, your theological convictions and your own personal
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.580]   convictions lends you to one or the other.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.520]   Maybe for some of us in this room, your past experience, whether good or bad, may actually
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.940]   put you in one camp or the other.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.800]   Maybe for some of you in this room, you just don't care.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.300]   The exits are just over here and here.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.240]   But whatever it is, I think we as human beings, we find ourselves gravitating towards one
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.560]   of these things more, maybe because of theology, maybe because of experience, maybe because
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.000]   of our own convictions, but we're found in one of these things.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.080]   Here's what I've found.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.520]   I've found that this is seasonal in my life.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.680]   I wonder if you've ever found this.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.520]   I remember in my 20s, which was a while ago, I remember in my 20s so passionate about the
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.840]   physical manifestations of the Holy Spirit, man, I wanted to see miracles.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.960]   I wanted to see God do anything.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.120]   I wanted to lay hands on people that were texting their friends.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.760]   Hi, how are you?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.840]   The Lord Jesus.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.960]   But I wanted to lay hands on people and pray for the Spirit, pray for miracles, see them
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.960]   set free.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   And I tell you what.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.600]   In my 20s, I saw incredible things happen.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   In my 30s, though, I went to Bible school.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.520]   And when I got to Bible school, it was almost like they did their very best to get rid of
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.320]   all of the manifestations of the Spirit, and it was all about the internal work of the
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.240]   sanctification of the Spirit.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.240]   And I studied scripture, and I learned about what the internal work of the Spirit does.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.640]   And I remember in my 30s, I was much more focused for a season on the internal work
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.880]   and the sanctification power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.760]   In my 40s, I wanted both.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.720]   In my 40s, I was like everywhere.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.880]   I want dramatic things.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.920]   I want the internal.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.440]   In my 50s now, I can barely keep my eyes open.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.080]   But for me, it's been a seasonal thing.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.320]   I've found myself moving in seasons.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.760]   Perhaps that's the same for you.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.680]   Here's what I want to say, and I think this is really important.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.080]   Here at The Vine, if you're new with us, welcome.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.640]   But here at The Vine, we've been talking about over the last number of months that we're
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.520]   in a season of uncharted waters.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.440]   What we mean by that is that the Lord is moving us as a church community out of our comfort
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.160]   zones into a place where we don't have a map or we don't have a strategy.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.920]   The Holy Spirit is beginning to do things amongst us that are taking us by surprise
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.560]   and causing us to kind of rethink how we do things together as a community.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.680]   It's an incredibly exciting time that we're in.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.800]   And because we are in an uncharted time, because we are feeling a little bit out of our comfort
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.960]   zones, here's what I think the Spirit wants you personally to lean into, to recognize
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:38.000]   which of these two sides you have a little bit more of a leaning towards, and then intentionally
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.840]   in this time, try to work on the other side.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.120]   Try to open your heart to the other aspects of the work of the Spirit.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.320]   Because when we're in a season, when we're in uncharted waters, when we're in a season
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.000]   where it's a little bit uncomfortable, we're out of our comfort zone, you're going to need
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.240]   both of these things at work in your life.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.640]   You're going to need the stability of the Spirit of God working in these beautiful manifestations,
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.840]   working on the internal transformation that anchors you in a season where we're really
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.800]   relying on Him to lead us.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.600]   We don't have a map, we have a guide, amen?
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.240]   And the guide is the Holy Spirit walking with us.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:22.660]   And He wants to manifest His work in your life through the external and the internal.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:28.280]   So my challenge for us here this morning is to not treat these things like an and/or,
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.280]   but to treat them like both/and.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.040]   Now how do we do that?
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.200]   Well, I want to do two things with us.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.280]   I want to first of all take us a little bit high up into a broad theological view of how
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.720]   Scripture provides for us a picture of the work of the Spirit.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.600]   And I want to, if you will, not go into the depths of the details of it, but I want to
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.420]   kind of do an airline kind of flyover of what Genesis to Revelation shares to us about the
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.180]   ongoing work of the Spirit.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.100]   And then from that place, I want to then take it and make it more personal for you.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.240]   How the bigger picture, if you will, the broad narrative, actually then begins to speak to
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.280]   you personally in your context.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.260]   And then after that, we're going to pray.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.940]   And we are going to pray.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.500]   And we're going to invite you to be brave, invite you to have some courage, invite you
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.580]   to wrestle with everything that I'm going to be teaching and speaking about over the
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:24.180]   next number of minutes, and then come forward and have someone lay their hands on you.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.380]   And to see the manifestation and the internal work of the Spirit truly begin to take root
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.380]   in us.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.380]   Amen?
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.380]   Can I pray for us?
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:38.140]   Father, we are so grateful for each person here and for the way you have formed and shaped
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.140]   them.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.820]   We all recognize that we have our personal tastes, our biases, the things that we naturally
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.140]   lean towards when it comes to your work of the Spirit.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.020]   Lord, I pray that as we open up the passages, as we look at the broader picture, Father,
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:57.300]   you would enable us to open our hearts and our minds to what else is there for us in
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.300]   this area.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.980]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.980]   Everyone says.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.980]   Amen.
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.060]   I want to talk to you about the eight movements that the Spirit does through Scripture.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.140]   There are eight predominant times where the Spirit does something significant to say something
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.700]   about Himself and about His work.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.340]   And we're going to look at those eight things as a way of fully understanding His work.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:22.260]   So the first is found right at the beginning of the Bible in Genesis 1 verse 2.
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:28.180]   And we explained in the first week of our series here at the Vine on the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:34.060]   we talked about how the first time we're introduced to the Spirit is as a Spirit that's hovering
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.060]   over creation.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.860]   I'm going to show you eight symbols to help illustrate these eight movements.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.860]   So the first one, look at that.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.860]   Isn't that brilliant?
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.620]   The Spirit hovering over creation.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:49.340]   Now what we see in Genesis 1 and 2 is this perfect picture of the Spirit hovering over
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.100]   what the Bible describes as a formless void, a dark creation.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.340]   And we said in week one that what the Spirit is doing in hovering over it is having this
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:06.200]   desire to take something that is formless, bring it into form, and then move it to fullness.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.180]   This is the creative process that you see in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.780]   The Spirit, through the spoken word of God, takes things that are formless, gives them
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:21.660]   form, and then moves them towards their fullness, a place of shalom that God describes as very
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.660]   good.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.860]   And so what we see, the first thing we learn about the Holy Spirit hovering over a formless,
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:33.540]   dark kind of void, and then bringing it into this beautiful creation, is that the Spirit's
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.940]   intent always is to take disorder and bring it to order.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.500]   The Spirit is at work in that.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.380]   We've been telling you a little bit about that over the last number of weeks, but that's
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.900]   the first movement of the Spirit.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.500]   Our introduction to the Spirit is one who takes things that are disordered and moves
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   it to order.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.860]   And then we know what happens next, right?
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.740]   In Genesis 3, Adam and Eve decide to sin.
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.900]   And in their rebellion against what God had called them to do, a division takes place.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.780]   They are actually, as part of that division, they are thrown out of the garden, which really
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.420]   was a biblical way of saying out of God's presence.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:13.580]   So the Spirit was there, hovering over creation, taking things into its perfect order.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.260]   Then sin takes place with humanity, and suddenly a divide comes between humanity and the Spirit
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.340]   of God, from humanity and the triune Godhead.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.140]   And that division then basically becomes the movement of the rest of Scripture.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.800]   The rest of Scripture is humanity going, "How do we get back to that relationship we had
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.820]   before sin was a reality?"
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.740]   And this division and the casting out of humanity from the presence of God becomes humanity's
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.740]   big focus.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.660]   This is why, in Genesis 11, they build a tower to try to get back up to that presence.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:50.180]   They think if they can just get back up to the heavens somewhere, then they can reconcile
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.980]   that Spirit and that presence.
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.420]   But that's not how God is going to do it.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.940]   In fact, God comes and He breaks down that tower, and He basically says, "We're going
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.860]   to do this a different way."
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:03.180]   The next movement, therefore, of the Spirit that we see takes place in Exodus chapter
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:04.900]   three.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.100]   Moses walking around suddenly sees a burning bush.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.940]   The Spirit suddenly manifested beautifully in this burning bush, and Moses goes over
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.940]   to it.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.940]   We know what happens, right?
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:22.580]   As he goes over to the burning bush, God calls out from the bush and says, "Moses, Moses,
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.820]   don't come any further forward, for the ground that you're standing on is what?
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.460]   Holy ground."
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.460]   Holy ground.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.260]   Not that Moses was holy, not that the ground was some special kind of ground that was sacred
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.260]   and holy.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.780]   No, it was the presence of God, the Spirit of God revealed once more towards humanity
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.300]   that became this holy space.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.900]   When God says, "Take off your sandals and step onto this holy ground," what He's saying
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.180]   is, "I want to fill the flesh, Moses.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.540]   I want to fill your flesh with My Spirit."
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:57.260]   There's going to be a communing again that was like what it was in the garden before.
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.780]   We want to commune now together because God is beginning to change and draw humanity back
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.500]   to Himself.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.160]   So the starting point is that the Spirit is disordered, the order.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.020]   The next thing is that He is holy, and that holiness, the holiness of God and the holiness
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.580]   of His Spirit becomes the way that humanity understands its separation from the Spirit.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.700]   The next movement is that God then appears by His Spirit on a mountain, Mount Sinai,
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.820]   also a part of the Exodus narrative.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.020]   And up on the mountain, something very special takes place.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.620]   On the mountain, the law is given.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.140]   The law is poured out.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.140]   That's the Old Testament.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:39.500]   First of all, the ten laws, the ten commandments, then eventually the Levitical law, all poured
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.660]   out through the power of the presence of the Spirit on a mountain, and only one person,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.660]   Moses, is able to go up into that presence and see God face to face.
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.460]   So this one person goes up, sees God face to face, the law is given.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.300]   And the law, this is the best way to understand it.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:00.140]   The law is birthed by the Spirit to explain to us the character of God.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.100]   Often when we think of the ten commandments, we think the ten commandments are basically
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.300]   a bunch of rules to make us live a boring life, right?
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.220]   Like a bunch of rules that we have to kind of adhere to or check up on a list just to
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.220]   make ourselves feel better or to think that we're going to be in some better relationship
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.220]   with God.
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.220]   But actually, that's not what the law was about.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:22.780]   See, the law was actually about kind of communicating to humanity who God is.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.740]   So when God says, "You will have no other God before me," He's explaining His character
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.160]   of loyalty and steadfastness.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.980]   When He says, "You will not commit murder," what He's saying about Himself is, "I am a
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.980]   God of life.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.740]   I am a God of giving, not a God of taking."
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.740]   So each of the laws represents some character of God that God is explaining, and it's the
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.500]   Spirit that births the character of God.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.900]   Are you with this still so far?
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.180]   Is this okay?
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.060]   Okay, hang with me, hang with me.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.060]   Here's the fourth one.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:58.660]   "Then God instructs them to take the tablets and place them in a box," quite literally,
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.060]   the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.340]   Now this is funny because so often as Christians we're trying to get the Spirit out of a box,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.780]   but here at this moment God puts the Spirit in a box.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.300]   Now why does He do this?
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.540]   It's because He wants the Spirit to be with His people.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.460]   But because of sin, there still needs to be a barrier between God and His holiness and
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.800]   God's people.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:25.940]   So He's placed within this box, and His presence now goes forward with His people.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.500]   And because His presence is with His people, their character is there, the people are created
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.080]   and made holy, not because they were perfectly holy themselves, but because God's presence
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.460]   was amongst them.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.260]   But it's in a box because there are boundaries.
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.500]   And if anybody was to open that box, if anyone was to carry that box in the wrong way, if
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.420]   anybody was to do something, then they would be kind of completely punished because that
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.180]   box was a sacred thing carrying the presence of God, and there was boundaries still between
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.100]   humanity and His presence.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.780]   But He had drawn nearer.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.180]   This becomes even more so when you see the next movement.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.240]   The box then gets placed eventually into the temple.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.580]   So David, Solomon, with the vision that they have for the temple and the construction of
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.100]   the temple, then the box placed in the heart of the temple itself.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.800]   And as it's placed in there, it's placed in this place called the Holy of Holies.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.380]   And the Holy of Holies was like the inner sanctum of where the Spirit of God was, where
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.180]   the Ten Commandments and the Ark of the Covenant sat.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.780]   And in the Holy of Holies, it was separated again from the people with a large, thick
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.300]   curtain.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.420]   And once again, only one person could go into the presence of God.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.420]   And this was the priest once a year who had completely purified himself for that journey
[00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.140]   to go into God's presence.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.300]   So there again, God's presence is with His people, but there's a boundary still that
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.700]   separates the holiness of God and His people themselves.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.220]   As God's people are taken into exile because of their sin, and Assyria and Babylon come
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:55.020]   and do that and bring them into exile, the temple, the first temple is destroyed.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.460]   And when the temple is destroyed, here's what happens to Israel.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.940]   They're wondering about the Spirit, and they say, "Where is the Spirit?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.620]   Where is the Spirit gone?
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.540]   Because of our brokenness and our sin, we're now in exile.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.940]   The temple's been destroyed.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.100]   God's presence has left us."
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.900]   And when 70 years later, they're actually released back, and Zerubbabel brings a group
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.520]   in the back to start to rebuild the temple.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.180]   They want to rebuild the temple.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.940]   They create the Holy of Holies again.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.020]   The presence of God again falls amongst this curtain, but there's a change in the thinking
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.680]   of Israel at this point.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:29.480]   And they think, "Look, every single time we try to restore our relationship with the presence
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.400]   and the Spirit of God, it doesn't seem to work.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.620]   Perhaps only God can do that work."
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:40.100]   And so at this period, although they rebuild the temple and God's presence comes back,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.860]   their thinking is slightly different.
[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:47.340]   They're like, "God will need to step in in the future if ever humanity and the Spirit
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.940]   will ever reconcile together again."
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.980]   And then comes Jesus.
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.660]   Jesus, as we know, is the Messiah, the incarnation, fully God and fully human.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.460]   And here's what I want you to think about that.
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.580]   This is the fullness now of the Spirit in a human person.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.900]   The incarnation is this beautiful idea that the Spirit is no longer in a bush, it's no
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.900]   longer in a mountain, it's no longer in a box, it's no longer in a temple, it's now
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.960]   come in a person.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.740]   And it's come in the fullness of a person so that the Spirit and humanity are now this
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.980]   picture of reconciliation.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.540]   But note, it's still just one person.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:31.060]   And Jesus, in living out the fullness of the Spirit within him, does the amazing external
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:37.460]   manifestations that we see, commands nature, walks on water, does the things, heals people,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.460]   multiplies food, does crazy stuff through the power of the Spirit.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.420]   And as he begins to walk out the kingdom, he begins to demonstrate what that kingdom
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.300]   could actually look like when the fullness of the Spirit and humanity come together.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.620]   That's the beauty of the incarnation.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.860]   But it's still just one person.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.060]   From the death and resurrection, everything changes.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.380]   And Jesus, in taking on the weight and the burden of sin onto his shoulders, for the
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.780]   wages of sin is death.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.380]   As he takes that into death and is raised again to new life on the third day, sin now
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.900]   has been dealt with.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:18.580]   The very thing that had separated the Spirit from humanity now dealt with.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:25.220]   This is why, actually, he turns to the disciples in his resurrection and says, "Don't go anywhere.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.060]   Wait, because I'm about to send you the thing that you truly need."
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.100]   He's like, "I need to actually go from here so that you will receive the fullness of this
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.500]   thing that I'm about to send to you."
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500]   And so he does.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:41.300]   He sends them the Holy Spirit, Acts chapter 2, and they begin to manifest the beauty of
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.500]   the gospel through human languages.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.420]   And many people in Jerusalem at that time begin to turn and hear the gospel together
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.780]   for the first time.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:56.700]   It is this beautiful idea that the Spirit now begins to get poured out on people, fulfilling
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:02.020]   the prophecy of Joel that would say, "In those days, the Spirit would come upon all flesh,"
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.500]   fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah, who would say, "There is a time coming where the Spirit
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.500]   of the Lord will be upon me so I can preach good news to the poor."
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.780]   And these things all begin to come together as the disciples themselves experience the
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.100]   fullness of the Spirit within them.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.620]   And they realize that there's no longer any separation anymore.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.700]   This is why Paul, then, when he's writing to the church, he writes this most profound
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.180]   theological idea.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.740]   No one in history had ever said this before.
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.340]   He says, "Don't you realize that you are now the temple of the Holy Spirit?"
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.420]   He's like, "It's not a building anymore.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.260]   Oh, back in the old times, we needed the separation because we could not enter the holiness of
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.900]   God without sin having been dealt with, but now sin has been dealt with, so don't you
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.500]   realize that the Spirit is now happy to make His home within you?
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.940]   Happy to come and have that fullness of the Spirit and the fullness of humanity, no longer
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.940]   just in the incarnation of Christ, but in the church itself."
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.940]   Which is why I love this symbol.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.220]   See all the people with the Spirit inside of them there?
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:06.660]   They look like bowling pins.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.580]   They're not bowling pins.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.100]   Those are people filled with the Spirit.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.780]   Which is why, then, Paul writes to the church and he says, "Don't you know that the same
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.540]   Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is now inside of you?"
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.620]   He then writes and says, "No one is able to say Jesus is Lord unless the Spirit enables
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.620]   them to say it."
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.020]   He's like, "The Spirit now.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.020]   There's no barrier.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.020]   There's no brokenness.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.380]   There's no separation.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.900]   We are now all filled with the Spirit of God.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.940]   And yes, it's the external manifestations, and we give grace for that, but it's also
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.700]   the internal transformation that is at work.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:45.100]   I can see the Spirit, and I can confess the Spirit because of the Spirit."
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:51.940]   So that's how Scripture would describe the movement, the eight primary movements of the
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:57.220]   Spirit, all to communicate that now the fullness of that Spirit is here with us.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.820]   Now, that's a very quick overview, but let me give you two important things of it.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.020]   The first is, I want you to see through all of this that there is a trajectory of the
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.620]   Spirit desiring to get closer and closer to you.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.480]   Are you with me?
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.020]   So from the start, it's like, okay, just hovering over everything, but then the narrative of
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:20.900]   Scripture, if you follow it from Genesis to Revelation, is the Spirit basically pursuing
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.020]   you.
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.220]   The Spirit getting closer and closer and closer and closer, and when Jesus does the death
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:31.900]   and the resurrection, pays the price for sin, then within us, the Spirit is constantly on
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.540]   your pursuit.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.580]   And this is a beautiful thing, because what the Scriptures really kind of teach us about
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.540]   the Spirit is that it's for our good.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:47.220]   It's for our benefit to connect us with Jesus, who connects us to the Father.
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.600]   The Spirit manifests the person and the character of Jesus, which is what the Spirit has always
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.700]   done with the law that was given on Mount Sinai.
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.060]   Then in Pentecost, which we're celebrating next week, the law is now written on the tablets
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.900]   of our heart and poured out by the Spirit.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.180]   In other words, the character of God is now not just written on some stone tablets, it's
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.380]   actually written within me.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:14.460]   But I get to see and feel that Spirit at work now within me, and it is a profound thing.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:23.540]   The brokenness of Andrew and the fullness of the Spirit as one.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.700]   And the reason why that's important is because when you think about it that way, the Spirit
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:33.740]   is always to connect you to Jesus, it's always to connect you to the Father, it's always
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.860]   for your good.
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.460]   Which is really interesting, because I've struggled many times in my Christian life
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.620]   with fear when it comes to the Spirit.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.620]   Anyone else ever felt that way?
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.980]   A little bit fearful of the Spirit?
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.980]   I know I have.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.780]   I've had season where I'm like, I'm not sure if I want to pray and invite the Spirit to
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.100]   come more, because I don't want to bark like a dog.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.100]   Right?
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.980]   Like, I don't want to do a weird thing.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.540]   I've seen at times the Spirit do weird things to people, and I don't want to be doing weird
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.540]   things.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540]   That's embarrassing.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.100]   So I've held myself back from the fullness of the Spirit at times out of fear.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.940]   I wonder if that resonates with anyone here.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.700]   But when the Scriptures teach us that the Spirit is always pursuing us, when the Scriptures
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.420]   teach us that the Spirit is leading us to Jesus, when we know that everything the Spirit
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.020]   has for us is for our good, Paul's like, why wouldn't we welcome it?
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.140]   Why wouldn't we eagerly desire the spiritual gifts?
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.380]   Why wouldn't we want the Spirit to fall on us and be a part of us?
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.980]   And if you're struggling here today with any sense of fear around the Holy Spirit, I can't
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.460]   wait to be able to pray with you in a moment.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.820]   Because I believe that the Lord wants to do something significant by breaking off the
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.220]   fear that I think we can so easily hold.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:48.780]   The reality is, the fear around the Holy Spirit is a strategy of the enemy.
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.020]   And as we stand together as a community and break off that stronghold that can easily
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:57.940]   be upon us, I believe we will be freer for the external manifestations and the internal
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.260]   transformation that the Spirit wants to bring.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.260]   Is that okay?
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.580]   Okay, that's the first thing.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.580]   Here's the second thing.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.780]   I want you to come have a look at this.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:11.620]   I want to explain now, before we go into prayer, exactly what all of this is saying to us about
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.260]   the work of the Spirit in fullness.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.260]   Now I'm going to do the work of the Spirit in like a little Spirit bubble like that,
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.660]   but we actually know that it's a person, right?
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.660]   The Spirit is a person.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.040]   We've talked about that in the series so far.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.580]   But I want to explain to you what we see in this whole eight movements of the Spirit and
[00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.860]   how it begins to show us something quite significant that's taking place in the work.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.020]   So there are actually two, that now looks like a tree by the way, but it's not a tree.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.500]   Just bear with me.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:41.980]   So what we see is that the Spirit is in the world.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.140]   The Scriptures in that overview I gave us would teach us that the Spirit is actually
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.100]   in the world.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:53.380]   In fact, the way it's described in Genesis as the ruach, it's a Hebrew word which means
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.500]   breath or wind.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:00.340]   The idea that the Spirit is the breath that brings all of creation alive.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:05.260]   In fact, it is the sustainer of all life.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:12.380]   So the Spirit sustains and brings to life everything, holds everything in its heart,
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.940]   holds everything in its ability to be able to breathe, have its function, and have its
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:16.940]   being.
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.900]   So the Spirit is in the world so that everything might find life.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:27.540]   Paul would later write in Romans chapter 8, Romans 8, this idea of like, hey, there's
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.540]   creation itself and it's groaning and longing for its own reconciliation, its own redemption
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.540]   with the Lord.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.340]   There's this longing in it.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.740]   And we see that the biggest picture of this is, as I've already explained, the incarnation,
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:48.540]   the power that there is in humanity and the Spirit now in the world together manifested
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.460]   in that beautiful way of the external and the internal that is at work.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.500]   So the Scriptures teach us that the Spirit is in the world.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.220]   But the Scriptures also show us that the Spirit is upon the world.
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.240]   This is slightly different and it's important to understand the differences.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.340]   So the Spirit in the world, the breath sustaining all life, the incarnation and its greatest
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.380]   expression, but the Spirit is also upon the world.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.500]   We saw that with the hovering element.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:21.220]   We see that in the prophetic words of Joel and Isaiah where they long for, as Joel would
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:26.740]   say that the Spirit in those days will be poured out upon all flesh, the idea that the
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.700]   Spirit moves upon.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:34.060]   But this is seen most dramatically actually in the death and resurrection moment where
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:40.720]   the curtain, I can't spell, where the curtain in the temple is split from top to bottom.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.300]   So in the moment where Jesus gives up his life, the curtain splits from top to bottom.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.300]   Now the question we should ask is why does the curtain split from top to bottom?
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:57.220]   It splits, yes, so that humanity is now symbolically invited in to the presence of God, but the
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:02.800]   split is also there to illustrate that this presence now can come out into the world.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.380]   So there is an in towards the Spirit by the cutting of the curtain, but there also is
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.700]   a releasing of the Spirit into the world through the beauty of that as well.
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:17.660]   This is really important because if you believe that the Spirit is upon the world and you
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.420]   believe that the Spirit is in the world, that means that when you wake up tomorrow and you
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.900]   go into your workplace, the Spirit is as much there as it is here right now.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.180]   Are you following this?
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.500]   This is theologically really important so that when you get up and go to work tomorrow,
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.520]   you have the same expectations.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:39.000]   It may not be worship music, it may be a board meeting, it may be a classroom, it may be
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.300]   whatever it is for you, but you can also think that the Spirit is as much at work in this
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:49.500]   place as he was yesterday at the vine.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.100]   I think God wants to, in this time of uncharted, make sure that we're expectant in the community
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:59.780]   as much as we are in this community.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.780]   Only me who is excited about that.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.020]   Now, this is where I'm going to finish.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.020]   Notice this.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.380]   The same of what the Spirit has done in the world, he has also done in us.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.940]   The Spirit is also in you.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:21.940]   You can look at it later, but in 1 Corinthians 12, 3, in 1 Corinthians 6, 19, Paul basically
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.860]   says the same thing, that we are able to say that Jesus is Lord because of the work of
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.260]   the Spirit in us.
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:34.020]   So the Spirit is in you to bring you to salvation, first and foremost, and then Paul says it
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:40.380]   is sanctification, the ongoing work of the Spirit to make us more and more like his son
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.900]   Christ Jesus, and that is Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:51.940]   Now in this process of sanctification, he gives us what's called the fruits of the Spirit,
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:58.580]   the Spirit that actually bears fruit inside of us, Galatians 5.22, and Ellison is going
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.300]   to preach and teach more on that fruit of the Spirit next week.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.500]   So the Spirit is in you for salvation and sanctification.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.540]   Helpful?
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:15.860]   But the Spirit is also at times upon you, and the Spirit comes upon you for various
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.140]   different things.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:22.460]   This is seen predominantly, again, you can look at 1 Corinthians 12, 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.660]   where it speaks ideally around the ideas of the gifts, the gifts of the Spirit and how
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:32.380]   the gifts of the Spirit are at work in us, upon us, using us.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.380]   Now, the important thing is that the upon you work of the Spirit is to essentially do
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.380]   this thing.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.480]   It's to empower you.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:47.540]   So where the Spirit is in you for salvation and sanctification, the Spirit comes upon
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.980]   you to empower you.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.100]   And the question is, why and what is it empowering?
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.540]   Well, the Bible would suggest two areas.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.860]   First of all, kingdom advancement.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.740]   This is what we see in the life of Jesus.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.840]   It's what we see in the life of the church.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.000]   The Spirit pours out upon his people and prophetic words come.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.620]   Prophetic words that help people to understand who God is, prophetic words that maybe changes
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:17.900]   something in someone's life, a word of knowledge that actually changes somebody's life dramatically.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:24.220]   Jesus' miracles performed to inaugurate the kingdom, the church now embracing the miraculous
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:30.540]   to show the world signs of the kingdom that is here, the kingdom advancement empowered
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.320]   by the Spirit that is upon us.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.820]   But then also, it speaks about the idea of victory over sin.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:43.260]   Now, of course, in Jesus' death and resurrection, sin is defeated.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.220]   But I think we all know that sometimes sin has a stronghold in us.
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.580]   Sometimes sin can become habitual for us.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:54.180]   And as much as we might try to fight it, we realize that there's a weakness to us.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:59.100]   The Spirit comes upon us at times to bring us greater victory over sin, particularly
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.740]   where there's strongholds or there's habitual sin that we've not been able to break at any
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.220]   point in time.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:11.380]   So the Spirit is in you and the Spirit is upon you.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.380]   Is that helpful?
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.820]   All right, five of you.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:15.820]   Good.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.820]   Now, notice this.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.900]   Here's what we actually do.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:25.140]   We put all of these things into boxes and we find our preferences.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.660]   And so for some of you, like I said earlier, you're like fully comfortable in this space
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.660]   right here.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.100]   But this idea kind of freaks you out a little bit.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.180]   Or maybe you're very comfortable in this space because that's how you were brought up.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:39.860]   Maybe you've been in a church environment where that's really clear.
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.780]   But this whole sort of fruit of the Spirit sanctification thing, you're not quite sure
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.780]   about that.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.660]   Maybe, again, you don't believe that God can be as powerful in your workplace as He is
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.220]   for 90 minutes at the vine on a Sunday.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.420]   We can all have our boxes.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:57.140]   And what I'm trying to say to us today is that if we're really going to embrace the
[00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:02.760]   work of the Spirit, it needs to be in all of these areas in our world and in our lives.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.260]   In the world, upon the world, in you, upon you.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.260]   Helpful?
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.980]   All right.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.660]   So that was like the intro.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:17.920]   I'm freaking you out now.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.700]   This is the main course.
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.820]   Because I've just unpacked a bunch of theological stuff for you, which is helpful and interesting,
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.820]   I hope.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:33.980]   But the reality is God does all of this so that He can transform and change us, culture,
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.100]   society, the world.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.220]   The good news of Jesus Christ is not that a church changes anything, but Jesus changes
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.540]   it.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:45.300]   The good news of Jesus Christ is not that a person can heal another person, but that
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.660]   the Spirit of God can heal someone.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:51.260]   The good news of Jesus Christ is that it all is about Him.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:57.980]   And He does all of this, not so, and we said this the other week, not so He can show off,
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.300]   but so that He can act.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.140]   So He can take us from a place of brokenness to greater freedom.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.860]   So that He can take us from a place of darkness to a place of light, where He can take the
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:12.180]   disorder in us and bring it into order.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.660]   And that's what we want to do now.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.460]   We've got 25 minutes.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.020]   Can you believe it?
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.220]   I hope you're excited.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   I'm excited.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.300]   We're going to have a prayer team in the upper house.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.540]   We're going to have a prayer team here in the lower house.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.700]   We're going to have some people at the front.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.980]   There's going to be some people here.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.860]   There's going to be some people around here.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.540]   And here's what we're going to do.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.300]   No one's going to be forced to do anything, but if you would like to receive prayer, maybe
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.580]   for you it's like, you know what?
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.220]   I've got too much fear.
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.620]   I've got too much fear and it's holding me back from this box right here, and I would
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.900]   love someone to pray for me and to release that fear.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.380]   Or maybe you're looking for more of the fruit to be at work in your life, and you'd like
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.820]   someone to stand for you and pray for the fruit to manifest.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.020]   Maybe you want more expectation for your workplace, and you want someone to come around you and
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.020]   stand with you.
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.500]   Maybe there's some habitual sin that's going on, and you're like, you know what?
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.220]   I've ignored it for too long.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.180]   I've tried to battle it in my own strength.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.300]   I've built my own Tower of Babel.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   Nothing is working.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.820]   I need the Spirit to break me free.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.180]   I'd love to do that.
[00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.540]   We would love to do that with you today.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.500]   So whatever it might mean for you, how is it that you would like to receive prayer?
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   And this is what we're going to do.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.420]   We're just going to enable a time of prayer.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:29.940]   There's going to be some worship happening, so if you're not being prayed for, if you
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:34.460]   just want to worship, maybe reflect on what we've taught today, invite the Spirit to be
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.980]   with you in worship.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:39.140]   If you'd like to come forward for prayer in a moment, we're going to do that for you as
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.140]   well.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.060]   So why don't we all stand together?
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.100]   And I'm just going to invite our pastors and prayer leaders and elders just to be available,
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.060]   whether that's to come to the front here or just on the sides in the upper house at the
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.380]   front and the back.
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.220]   I wonder whether we just all open our hands if you're comfortable to do so, and I'm going
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:03.620]   to pray and then we're going to invite you to respond.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:10.780]   Father, we are standing before you as your people, and we're so grateful that we're at
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:16.940]   the part of the biblical story where the Spirit is at work in us, where the Spirit, because
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.940]   of Christ's death and resurrection, is fully here for us.
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:30.420]   And Father, we stand here at the Vine on the first Sunday of June 2025, and we say, "Come
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.980]   Holy Spirit.
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.300]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.660]   Come Holy Spirit."
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.240]   We pray you would break fear in the name of Jesus.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.240]   We pray you would bring healings in the name of Jesus.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:50.480]   We pray that the miraculous would be manifested here in the name of Jesus.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:56.420]   We pray for sanctification, salvation, the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.620]   We pray for our workplaces.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.060]   We pray for the places of influence you've given us.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:08.420]   We pray that the Spirit would be in and upon the world, in and upon us, and we pray this
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:14.460]   fervently.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:17.180]   So I encourage you to be brave.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.340]   You'd like to receive prayer, you can just make your way out and come forward, both in
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.680]   the upper house, again, here in the overflow, you can come on into the room as well.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.900]   And we're just gonna take time to pray for each one of you personally.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.260]   So anybody who'd like to receive personal prayer, please come forward.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.840]   (gentle music)
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
