[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   Amen.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.320]   Okay, so if you've been here in the last couple of weeks,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.640]   you know we just wrapped up our sermon series on healing
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.280]   and we're starting a brand new sermon series
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.760]   and I'm gonna introduce the speaker of today
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.360]   and he will come and tell us about that.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   Let's put our hands together and welcome Pastor Tim.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.840]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.440]   Who else is gonna start a new sermon series, right?
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.040]   Why don't we stretch out our hands and pray for him?
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.840]   Father, we just pray for your anointing
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.360]   and your presence on Tim today.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.500]   This word, this actually, this whole sermon series
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.420]   that you have put on his heart,
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.600]   you have something you wanna share with us
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.080]   through him today.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.320]   And so God, I pray you will anoint not just him,
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.860]   but also our ears, you will anoint our hearts
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.080]   to receive this message that you wanna bring to this church
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.040]   so that we could be your people,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.960]   ready to do your work in this area.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.800]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.840]   Thank you Chapman.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.120]   I don't know if you have ever found yourself
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.480]   in a place where you are lost,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.360]   where you are just lost.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.360]   Now I know I have.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.040]   When I was a young adult,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.380]   I had just graduated from university, I started working.
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.780]   And during that time, my company,
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.200]   they moved me to a location where I didn't know anyone.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.040]   And so without community, without that support,
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.720]   I started making choices that were just not good.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.120]   I didn't have the right priorities in my life
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.520]   and I just started drifting.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.360]   And I wasn't being the person that I wanted to be,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.760]   not in the very least.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.440]   I knew I wasn't who I wanted to be.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.240]   I don't know, have you ever felt that way?
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.680]   You're like, I'm not who I wanna be.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.000]   I know God has something better for me.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.400]   And I knew that.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.700]   And so that was the circumstance there.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.400]   So what do you do as a Christian
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.280]   when you find yourself in a place
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.020]   where you are losing your way?
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.040]   How do you find your way back
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.440]   into the life that God intends for you?
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.200]   How do you get back on track?
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.920]   Now perhaps some of you are feeling this way right now,
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.360]   that you have been in one way or another losing your way.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   Maybe you just have been losing that passion for Jesus.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.120]   Like you used to be excited to come and to worship
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.280]   and spend time in Jesus' presence,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.180]   but now suddenly that's not the same anymore.
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.840]   Maybe you've gotten off track wandering
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.120]   because you have other priorities.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.680]   Jesus somehow moved away from the center of your life
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.440]   and suddenly there's other things
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.680]   that are absorbing your time, your heart,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.640]   your thinking, your imagination.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.560]   And you weren't even aware that it was happening
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.560]   and suddenly you find yourself in this place
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.280]   where your faith is really not playing a role
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   or much of a role in your life anymore.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.660]   Now I have good news for you.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.200]   I think we all at one point or another
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.720]   can relate to this experience
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.200]   and we go through these different seasons,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.000]   but today we're gonna start a sermon series,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.200]   11 weeks through the book of Galatians.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.040]   And in that, we're gonna see how God invites us
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.540]   to get back on track and align ourselves with Jesus again.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.560]   And so that's this process that we're gonna go through.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.300]   Now I wanna introduce to you the book of Galatians,
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.600]   give you a little bit background information
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.160]   and also say a little bit about
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.480]   why are we going through the book,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.320]   a little bit more about
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.480]   why are we going through this book in this season.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.520]   So the first thing is,
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.900]   Galatian Christians, they were also losing their way.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.680]   They were losing their faith.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.880]   They were not on the right track.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.960]   Paul had, the apostle Paul had founded the church.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.480]   He planted it, it's interesting, he was actually sick.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.580]   So him being sick led to him ministering to people
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.840]   which then started the church.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.180]   I love how God works.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.100]   It wasn't planned, but God worked
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.700]   and established that church.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.380]   And so after some time, after these churches were settled,
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.460]   he moved on, continued his work,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.500]   his calling from God of proclaiming the gospel
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.980]   and planting new churches.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.100]   But then there was a group of people
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.040]   that followed after Paul.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.440]   And people call them different names.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.300]   Sometimes they call them Judaizers.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.460]   Sometimes they call them rival missionaries.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.420]   Paul himself refers to them as agitators
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.160]   in the letter of Galatians.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.700]   Now, what was going on?
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.720]   What was happening?
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.000]   Well, they came in after Paul
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.340]   and they said that Paul didn't give them
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.660]   the full gospel message.
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.500]   He only shared half of it with them.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.300]   And basically, they also questioned his apostleship.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.820]   They're like, he's just a second-rate apostle.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.060]   And so let us share with you the full gospel.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.260]   That's what they were saying.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.400]   And so then they added to what Jesus has done.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.900]   They added circumcision and observance of the Mosaic law.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.700]   Now, just imagine that for a moment.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.260]   Picture yourself in a company.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.340]   Maybe you had a role.
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.300]   You set up the department.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.900]   You get everything running in the way,
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.980]   systems, that everything is running smoothly and good.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.740]   And then now you get a promotion.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.660]   You move on to a different department.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.140]   Somebody comes in after you.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.220]   And then suddenly you start hearing rumors
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.180]   that this person's saying that everything that you did
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.140]   was not a good approach.
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.940]   And they start undoing all the work that you did.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.140]   And as you're hearing about this,
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.660]   you're like, man, just whatever this person's doing,
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.620]   they're bringing this department to disaster.
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.060]   I mean, that's what Paul must have felt
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.060]   as he heard about these reports
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.820]   about these rival missionaries
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.460]   really deceiving and misleading the people.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.940]   And so what Paul does, he decides to write a letter.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.100]   And to defend himself as an apostle,
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.460]   to defend this gospel, and to get the wandering Galatians
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.660]   who are starting to believe what these rival missionaries
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.380]   are saying, to get them back on track.
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.340]   And so what Paul does,
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.020]   he goes back to the basics of the gospel.
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.060]   And he casts for them the vision that God has for them
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.700]   of how they can live in the fullness of the life
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.860]   that God has for them,
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.300]   that God wants to see unfold in their lives.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.820]   And so he brings them back to the basic things
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.380]   so that they can be aligned and be set right again
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.140]   and move from being wandering
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.700]   to now being on the right track with God again.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.140]   Now, why are we going through the book of Galatians
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.620]   at this point in time as a church?
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.700]   So we're also a new church plant.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.420]   So similar to the Galatian churches.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.500]   Now, there's no specific deceiving or false teachers
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.380]   who have come here, just wanna be clear about that.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.900]   That's not why we're doing this series.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.060]   I'm not like talking to somebody indirectly.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.020]   But one of the things that is so essential for us
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.620]   as a new church is that we build our church,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.580]   our community on the right foundation,
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.340]   that we build it on the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.420]   to the good news about Jesus,
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.300]   and that we work out the implications
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.420]   of that gospel in our lives.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.340]   There's a lot of implications for that,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.420]   how we relate to one another,
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.300]   how God has made us family from these different backgrounds.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.520]   And so we wanna work those things out with each other.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.700]   But then also we wanna,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.700]   when we had the grand opening here in this place,
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.820]   we talked about that we wanna be carriers
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.560]   of the gospel of peace to our community,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.460]   that we wanna hold forth this good news of Jesus
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.300]   to people around us.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.260]   Well, if we wanna do that,
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.700]   we have to be clear about what the gospel is,
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.100]   and we need to let the gospel do its own work in our lives.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.020]   And so that's the first reason why we right now
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.820]   as a church wanna look at the book of Galatians,
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.940]   'cause we just wanna lay that right foundation,
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.820]   we wanna align ourselves right,
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.340]   and we wanna be able to confidently go
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.500]   and to share with clarity the message,
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.660]   the good news of Jesus.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.500]   So that's the first thing.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   The second thing is, Paul in Galatians 4.19, he says this,
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.300]   "My dear children, for who I am again
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.900]   in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you."
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.500]   So Paul, he's using the metaphor
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.920]   of giving a second time birth to the same baby.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.820]   He's like, "Why do I have to do this again?
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.580]   Why do I have to go through this pain again?"
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.580]   But his heart as a Christian leader, as an apostle,
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.100]   is he really wants to see people established
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.460]   in all the fullness and all the purposes
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.340]   that Jesus has for them.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.180]   He wants Christ to be fully formed in them.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:47.340]   Now, our vision as a church is growing big people.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.820]   And ultimately, growing big people
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.940]   is to become more like Jesus,
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.220]   is to become more Christ-like.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.060]   And so Paul, as he was seeing
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.180]   where these false teachers were leading the Galatians,
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.700]   that would not lead to the life
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.220]   that God wants to bring about in his people.
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.420]   It would not bring the life
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.500]   where we're in keeping in step with the Spirit
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.300]   that bears the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.660]   And then Paul wants to see that life unfold
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.620]   so that the Galatian Christians,
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.860]   they can live an empowered life,
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.580]   that they can be empowered disciples of Jesus,
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.420]   you know, who are led and empowered by the Spirit.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.020]   Because whatever the false teachers were paddling
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.980]   was a spiritual dead end.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.380]   It didn't produce anything good
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.220]   'cause it was devoid of the Spirit of God
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.780]   and devoid of the power of God, what they were claiming.
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.340]   So those are the reasons why we are going through
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.180]   the book of Galatians at this point in time.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.460]   Of course, we're gonna unpack more as we go through this.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.620]   But today, we're gonna start off by looking at
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   how does Paul address the Galatians?
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.980]   How does he help them get back on track?
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.180]   How does he help them find that life
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.580]   that God is calling them and wanting them to have?
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.780]   How does he lead them back to that?
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.660]   And so that's what I wanna look at with you today
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.660]   in this message.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.620]   And so we're in Galatians chapter one, verse one.
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.100]   So let me read this to you.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.180]   It says, "Paul, an apostle,
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.940]   sent not from man nor by man,
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.420]   but by Jesus Christ and God the Father,
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.760]   who raised them from the dead
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.540]   and all the brothers and sisters with me
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.780]   to the churches in Galatia.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.880]   Grace and peace to you from God our Father
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.900]   and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.360]   who gave himself for our sins to rescue us
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.860]   from the present evil age,
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.480]   according to the will of God the Father,
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.380]   to whom be glory forever and ever, amen."
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.740]   I'm astonished that you are so quickly
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.820]   deserting the one who called you to live
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.740]   in the grace of Christ
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.980]   and are turning to a different gospel,
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.300]   which is really no gospel at all.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.940]   Evidently, some people are throwing you into confusion
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.700]   and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.380]   But even if we or an angel from heaven
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.940]   should preach a gospel other than the one we preach to you,
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.420]   let them be under God's curse.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.880]   As I have already said, so now I say again,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.940]   if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.460]   than what you accepted,
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.420]   let them be under God's curse.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.060]   And now, am I now trying to win the approval
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.500]   of human beings or of God?
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.020]   Or am I trying to please people?
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.440]   If I still were trying to please people,
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.060]   I would not be a servant of Christ.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.460]   Wow, that's a lot, right?
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.960]   There's a lot to unpack there.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:09.540]   So how does Paul start addressing the Galatians
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.660]   who are losing their way
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.580]   and is trying to get them to come back?
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.220]   Well, there's a lot of things he does.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.540]   The first thing is he actually really names the problem
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.400]   and the issue.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.940]   So he addresses what the problem is.
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.260]   And so actually most of this addresses what the problem is.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.220]   And there's two main problems.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.920]   Well, let me just focus on these verses six and seven.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.800]   So there he says,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.580]   "I'm astonished that you were so quickly deserting
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.540]   "the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.620]   "and are turning to a different gospel,
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.720]   "which is really no gospel at all.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.100]   "Evidently, some people are throwing you into confusion
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.940]   "and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ."
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.620]   So Paul, he is astonished.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.020]   He is exasperated.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.740]   He is dumbfounded.
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.300]   Like, what's wrong with you people?
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.180]   That's what he's saying.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.220]   Like, what happened?
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.620]   I was just there with you not that long ago.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.580]   And now suddenly you're on this totally different track.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.220]   I mean, he really can't help himself,
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.680]   but expresses his surprise.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.420]   And they were deserting the,
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.660]   they were not living anymore,
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.060]   moving away from living in the grace of Christ.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.100]   That's what he says.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.140]   So the story of Galatians
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.860]   actually points to all of our tendencies.
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.460]   That we are, what's that song, "Prone to Wander," right?
[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.060]   What's the actual, it's a hymn.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.080]   I don't know hymns that well.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.540]   But there's a line that says, "Prone to Wander."
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.500]   Well, that's us.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.620]   We're prone to wander.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.260]   But people, we get off track all the time.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:52.080]   But God had done this incredible saving work
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.040]   in the Galatians' life.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.040]   And Paul, he takes them actually back to their experience.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.280]   Because when Paul preached the gospel message,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.940]   God called the Galatians to themselves.
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.800]   You know, whenever the gospel message is preached,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.320]   God calls people to himself
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.280]   through the preaching of the gospel.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.160]   And they responded with faith.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.600]   And they received the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.240]   experienced God's power working in their lives.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.040]   And so Paul is taking them back to it.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.320]   And then he's, but then he's like,
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.480]   but why are you now so quickly deserting
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.660]   the one who called you?
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.500]   Why are you turning away from him?
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   And they're turning their backs on God's grace.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.520]   So what was happening?
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.280]   And then he says that they're returning to a non-gospel,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.180]   that the gospel message was perverted,
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.500]   or they perverted the gospel of Christ.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.300]   So what was this message?
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.580]   Well, the rival missionaries,
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.980]   they added something to the gospel message.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.420]   So instead of it just being Christ's saving work,
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.660]   it's like they added a plus.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.020]   And then it was also circumcision
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.820]   and observance of the law that was needed.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:20.960]   And Paul is saying that by doing that,
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.340]   they are completely changing the gospel.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.580]   It's not a gospel at all anymore when we do that.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.220]   Because now what happens when you add something to,
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.060]   when there's something else that is needed
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.660]   to bring you into God's family,
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.700]   to make you a Christian besides Jesus'
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.660]   saving work on the cross,
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:45.820]   what happens is you start putting Jesus aside
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.460]   because you don't really need Jesus.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.740]   And you start putting our own efforts in the center
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.480]   of law observing, of doing this, of doing that.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.460]   And so Paul is saying like,
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.340]   and that changes everything.
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.380]   That is no longer good news
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.020]   because then you becoming part of God's family,
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.180]   you living the empowered life has to do with you,
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.580]   not with Jesus.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.460]   And so let me try to,
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.380]   we're gonna unpack this more throughout the series.
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.100]   This is today just scratching the surface with this.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.180]   But let me unpack this a little bit more.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.180]   So I have a definition of what the gospel is.
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.460]   So the heart of the gospel message
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.140]   is that Christ died for our sins,
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.260]   that he freed us from the power of sin
[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.580]   and evil over our lives,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.500]   filled us with his Holy Spirit
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.540]   and brought us into a personal relationship with God.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.220]   Our right standing with God is 100% the work of Christ.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.880]   100%, not like 80/20.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.780]   We come empty handed to God.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.620]   There is nothing that we can do out of our own effort
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.000]   to earn the right standing with God.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.560]   We simply respond with repentance and faith
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.600]   to the good news and receive the gift of salvation.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:19.260]   And whenever we add things to the gospel,
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:26.860]   then suddenly we start relying on our own efforts
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.340]   and we still do that today.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.900]   We still add things to the gospel message.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.500]   Maybe it's like if you wanna be really a Christian,
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.320]   you not only need to believe in Jesus
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.540]   and receive his forgiveness
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.720]   and come to him with repentance, faith,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.340]   but you also need to believe these certain doctrines
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.700]   that a particular church holds
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.980]   and you need to do these certain actions.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:54.140]   And so then we're putting extra requirements
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.300]   in the way of people who God wants to come to,
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.060]   that God wants for them to come to himself.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.980]   And then really what this, if you think about it too,
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.980]   is if it depends on us, what if we really have messed up?
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:13.260]   What if our life is such a mess?
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.660]   I mean, it would be hopeless for people like us
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.360]   when our life is such a mess.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.340]   How could we come to Jesus if it depends on us?
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.100]   But because it's 100% the work of Jesus,
[00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.100]   the saving work, that's why anyone can come
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.140]   and God can restore and transform your life
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:37.700]   and make you part of his family.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.700]   And so Paul is saying the problem is,
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.180]   and it's not a gospel at all,
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.220]   is because they have added to the saving work of Christ,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.120]   they have added these additional requirements.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.780]   And that is a non-gospel,
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.100]   it's a perversion of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.140]   So that's what Paul's saying, that's the issue,
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.100]   because it's not just a little,
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.580]   oh, he did just have a little bit of a different pain,
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.480]   no, it's a completely different thing.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:11.420]   So this is the analysis of Paul from the situation.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.820]   So that's the first thing that he does,
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.180]   he takes the Galatian to the analysis of the situation.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.060]   Like this is completely different, this is no gospel,
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.500]   you are being misled by this.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.540]   But then the second thing that Paul does,
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.420]   he actually takes them also back
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.540]   to the grace and peace of Jesus.
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.000]   He takes them back to the gospel message themselves
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.940]   because they're wondering, they've lost track,
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.380]   they've lost their way.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.260]   And what do we do when we lose our way?
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.100]   Well, we come back to the cross of Jesus,
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.500]   we come back to the grace of Jesus.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.740]   And we allow Jesus to minister to us,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.700]   we come again empty-handed and say,
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.100]   Jesus, I'm sorry, forgive me.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.820]   And we receive this grace again,
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:56.260]   and we are strengthened and we are renewed
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.660]   in our discipleship, in our relationship.
[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.700]   And so Paul, and this starts in verse three,
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.300]   he takes them, he gives a normal greeting.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.800]   So actually, let me read this.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.620]   It says this, grace and peace to you from God our Father
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.960]   and our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.320]   to rescue us from the present evil age
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.360]   according to the will of our God and Father.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.800]   So grace and peace is like the normal standard greeting
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.040]   that Paul uses, and it's a summary of the gospel message.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   Galatians is the only letter where Paul expands
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.040]   on that greeting, where he further unfolds
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.120]   what the gospel message entails.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.360]   And it might have been even like
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.380]   a early Christian confession.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.960]   And so he takes them back to this message
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.080]   that he has proclaimed and wants to lead them back
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.960]   to this place of where they come empty handed,
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.280]   where it doesn't depend on their works,
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.960]   and where they just say, Jesus, I need you,
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.400]   I surrender to you, I need you to forgive me,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.000]   I need you to get me back on track because I'm off track.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.360]   And that's how the Galatians started, right?
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.480]   So he's taking them also back
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.400]   to how they first became Christians.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.600]   And I don't know if you ever do that.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.960]   If you ever, in your own story,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.540]   go back to what Jesus has done, I think we forget, right?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.960]   We forget this amazing work that Jesus has done,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.240]   we get distracted.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.640]   And so Paul is taking them back to this amazing moment
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.840]   when they first became a Christian.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   And actually as Christians,
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.080]   we need to continue to return to that.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.920]   And we need to continue to receive the gospel message.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.040]   The gospel message doesn't only bring us
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.640]   into the family of God, it actually also helps us
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.920]   with continuing to live the Christian life
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.500]   because we live by the grace and mercy of God.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.560]   And we continuously need it.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.620]   Now, I was a few years back,
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.520]   I had, I was in Chum Shui Po with some pastors
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.520]   and Francis Chan was there
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.200]   and he was telling us about something,
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.840]   I don't remember what he was talking about.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.920]   And, but I remember just sitting there
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.680]   and listening to Francis Chan.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.560]   If you know Francis Chan, he's a well-known pastor,
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.400]   he was here in Hong Kong for a while.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.040]   There's just something about him.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.880]   And as he was talking, was like,
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.120]   I could tell man, this guy spends time with Jesus.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.620]   Like he spends time in Jesus's presence.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:23.760]   And as I was listening to him, I was like,
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.920]   I just was feeling the urge to go spend time with Jesus.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.200]   'Cause I had been wandering,
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.500]   you know, I had been gotten a little bit lost.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.440]   And so actually after the meeting,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.920]   I called my then boss, Carla, Pastor Carla,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.520]   and I said, "Hey, Carla,
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.600]   I need to go spend some time with Jesus."
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.260]   And she of course said, "Yes."
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.040]   You know, so I went and spent some time with Jesus.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.320]   But I wonder for us, some of us here today,
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.640]   maybe that's what you need to do.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.320]   Is not keep going with whatever you've been doing,
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.640]   but actually going back and spending some time
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.420]   in intimacy with Jesus.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:04.120]   Reading his word, maybe even reading passages
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.800]   that were about Jesus's death, resurrection,
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.600]   about the gospel message.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.820]   Just let the Holy Spirit do a renewing work in your life.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:19.780]   So Paul takes the Galatians back to their beginning.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.340]   He says, "Man, I've worked in your life.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.560]   Why you suddenly need something else?"
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:30.100]   And he wants them to be renewed as they just dwell
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:34.340]   and meditate and spend time with Jesus.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.980]   But Paul, he keeps hammering away at things.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.020]   And so one thing he does, he declares a curse.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.980]   Did that surprise anyone?
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.780]   Right, a lot of times you don't really look at passages
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.980]   where people are cursed.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.780]   And so Paul declares a curse on anyone
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.820]   who proclaims a different gospel
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.180]   than the one that he had shared with them.
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.020]   Well, that's intense, right?
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.540]   So you can tell this is a serious matter.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.780]   It's not a little thing.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.420]   So I wanna read verse eight to you.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.060]   It says this, "But even if we or an angel from heaven
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.660]   should preach a gospel other than the one preached to you,
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.860]   let them be under God's curse."
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.580]   So Paul is giving them a hypothetical situation.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.420]   Even if an angelic being would come
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.840]   and would declare something else,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.300]   they are under curse, he should not believe them,
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.500]   even if that were the case.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.080]   And so then he moves from a hypothetical
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.300]   to the actual situation.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.940]   In verse nine, he says this.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.940]   "As we have already said, so now I say it again,
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:45.500]   if anybody is preaching to you a gospel
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.260]   other than what you accepted,
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.540]   let them be under God's curse."
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.860]   Well, that's what was happening, right?
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.260]   There was a gospel being preached.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.100]   But it's interesting, he doesn't name the agitators.
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.180]   He doesn't say, you know, Billy Bob is under curse
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:01.340]   because he preached a different gospel.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.660]   He just gives this general statement.
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.980]   Anyone, including himself.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.940]   So Paul is not looking for allegiance to himself.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:18.900]   What he wants is bring the Galatians back to allegiance
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.980]   to the true gospel message,
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.940]   that they are committed to it, that they protect it,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.560]   that they understand it, that they guard it.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.620]   I think that's a word for us as a church,
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:36.580]   that we have an allegiance to the gospel message.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.460]   That we protect it, that we guard it,
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.460]   that we're careful with it ourselves.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.300]   So Paul, again, he's just bringing them back.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.140]   It's all about the gospel, bringing them back,
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.180]   you know, from all these different angles.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:56.460]   And then it's interesting, in verse 10, he says this.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.340]   "Am I now trying to win the approval
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.980]   of human beings or of God?
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.140]   Or am I trying to please people?
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.340]   If I were still trying to please people,
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.560]   I would not be a servant of Christ."
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.740]   Now, apparently the rival missionaries,
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.940]   they had accused Paul of being a people pleaser.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.380]   That he proclaimed the gospel that people wanted to hear,
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.500]   that was just meeting the itching of their ear.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.340]   That he left out the complicated parts,
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.500]   that he only gave them half,
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.740]   and he left away the observing the law and circumcision.
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.240]   He left away the hard parts.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.780]   And Paul is, I mean, he's already said verses one through nine,
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.260]   you know, it's already written all that.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.620]   And he's like, "Hey, do I sound like a guy
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.060]   who's trying to please people here?
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.580]   Who announces curses and things?
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.700]   Do I sound like a people pleaser to you?"
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.660]   I mean, that's basically, so it's almost like ironic.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.220]   You know, he's asking the Galatians
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.660]   who had apparently started believing in that accusation.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.620]   And what's interesting is that it says
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.380]   that if I were still trying to please people,
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.860]   so that means Paul used to please people.
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.340]   He used to be a people pleaser.
[00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:18.380]   And I think, I don't know about you,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.840]   people pleasing, I struggle with that.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.060]   You know, I like people,
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.660]   I don't wanna rub anyone the wrong way.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.580]   I like people liking me.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.100]   I like harmony, I don't like conflict.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.020]   So sometimes it's just easier to people please, right?
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:36.780]   So I think there's actually another thing
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.620]   that gets us off track when we please people
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.820]   instead of pleasing God.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.260]   It's also a way that we wander away from God.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.580]   And Paul is saying that he used to do that,
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.900]   but something has changed, something has transformed him.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.180]   And we even know what transformed
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.420]   because he talks about moving from being a people pleaser
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.380]   to now being a servant of Christ and pleasing God.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.900]   So there was somewhere along the way,
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.740]   whether that, and I think this was already
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.200]   during his Christian journey,
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.500]   not that he became a Christian,
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.780]   then suddenly he stopped pleasing people completely.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.060]   I think there was still some time
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.360]   where that needed to be worked out in his life.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.860]   But where he was committed to doing God's will
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.820]   above all else, where he was committed to serving Jesus
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.820]   and not to make, you know, please people
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.420]   and do what they wanted to hear.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.260]   Now, what are some ways that we please people today?
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.460]   Well, we do that in businesses, in our workplaces.
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.940]   We do that in our relationships.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.420]   We do that, it happens in the education field,
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.660]   families, social media.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.940]   Just think of social media.
[00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:51.580]   When you create a post, carefully crafted,
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.780]   hours spent, the right filter.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.120]   Actually, I'm not even good at social media myself.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.940]   So I'm probably the wrong person to talk about this.
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:01.460]   You know, doing this incredible IG story.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.580]   I mean, what are we looking for?
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.680]   We're looking for people's approval of us
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.380]   that affirm our worth, that say, wow, you're amazing.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.780]   Isn't that true?
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.360]   I think so.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.580]   And we also want to avoid getting backlash.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.940]   Has anyone ever gotten backlash
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.100]   on some of their social media posts?
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.300]   I have.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.180]   I once had 100 messages.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.020]   I touched a subject in the US
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.140]   that was about gun violence
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:32.320]   after the Las Vegas shooting,
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.620]   and it got really personal.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.420]   We were talking about why do we have
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:38.820]   so many automatic weapons and blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.740]   So honestly, after that experience,
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.940]   I also am a little bit careful what I say.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.900]   I don't want to deal with the backlash.
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:52.820]   But when I was a pastor in the US,
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.500]   I wanted to immerse myself in the community,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.460]   not just the Christian community,
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.940]   but actually just the community where I was living.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.260]   And so I decided to volunteer in a library,
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.860]   in a public library.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.500]   So I helped out with cleaning the office, the background.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.700]   I started shelving books, whatever they needed.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.780]   I just helped out and was getting to know people
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.540]   while I was doing that.
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.160]   So after being there for a while,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.700]   one of the employees asked me
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.980]   to start scanning out 20 books
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.100]   or checking out 20 books
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.780]   and then just put them in the return box.
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.180]   And I do that multiple times.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.780]   So I started doing that.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.500]   And after a while, I was thinking,
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.020]   I was like, what am I doing here?
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.820]   Why am I checking out books in the library,
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.900]   taking them from their shelf,
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.700]   put them in the return box?
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.260]   And so I realized that I was somehow
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.700]   manipulating some book circulation statistics or something
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.080]   that probably was needed for whether it's local
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.620]   or government funding or something.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.980]   But you know what?
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.860]   I was a people pleaser.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.700]   I kept doing it.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.420]   Now it bothered me so much the next week
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.780]   that when I came back, I was like,
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.940]   if he asked me to do it,
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.620]   I'm gonna say that I don't wanna do it.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.500]   And so that's what I'm doing.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.300]   And truth of the matter, I'm volunteering, right?
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.220]   What do I have to lose?
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.140]   So even so stupid to even try to please someone
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.440]   where you're volunteering.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.740]   But then think about when it's in places
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.420]   where it really matters.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.860]   You know, when it's about a family,
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.200]   where not you're gonna have a paycheck
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.460]   and you ask to compromise and manipulate something
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.480]   or evade taxes or whatever it may be.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.780]   Then it's different.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.060]   So that's one way that we also get off track.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   And Paul, he's giving us an example of,
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.940]   you know, when we have security
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.820]   of Jesus's work in our lives,
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:49.140]   when we can just rest in that we are loved,
[00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:52.180]   we are accepted, you know, by God,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.340]   then that actually frees us up
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.560]   to the need to be people pleasers.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.760]   You know, it can be really transformative
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.780]   as our identity in Christ gets more and more solid.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.420]   We have less and less the need to need to please people.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.060]   And so Paul was encouraging the Galatians
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.220]   also in the strong identity formation,
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.220]   you know, that they more and more become people
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.220]   who choose to please God and instead of pleasing man.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.380]   Now, where does all of this leave us?
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.620]   And I wanna invite the worship team to come up at this point.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.540]   All right, at the beginning of the sermon, I asked,
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.660]   so what do you do when you lose your way as a Christian?
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.440]   How do you find your way back into the life
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.240]   that God is calling you to live?
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.900]   And we saw several things.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.900]   For one, maybe we understand what has misled us
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.940]   or taken us away from the life of God in the first place.
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.200]   And then maybe today as I was sharing,
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.700]   there was actually some things that came up for yourself,
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.620]   like, where you're like, wow, it can be business,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.940]   it can be other priorities, it can be many different things.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.840]   Can be people pleasing.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.420]   But then we also looked, what does Paul do?
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.260]   Well, he takes them back to the gospel.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.220]   He takes them back to this when they encountered Jesus
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.500]   for the first time and experienced just as love and grace
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.940]   where they came empty handed to him, they had nothing.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:31.060]   And he received them, he brought them into his family.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:34.600]   That was not because they met some circumcision
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.620]   or other requirements or believed these 20 doctrines
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.140]   and did 20 acts of service a day.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:45.540]   It was just because Jesus loves them,
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.840]   forgives them and gives them grace.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:55.540]   And so, and then we saw that Paul also just shows
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:00.100]   that he really wants us, the gospel to be centered
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.660]   in our life, that we meditate on it,
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.420]   that we don't lose track of it
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.500]   because it also helps us as a church, as individuals,
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.400]   to stay on track of what Jesus has for us,
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.640]   that we live by his grace and mercy.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.900]   And when you live by grace instead of your own achievements,
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:23.020]   you're less judgmental, you're less prideful
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.920]   because you know you don't deserve it.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.700]   And you just really live a different life.
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.380]   And so that's where Jesus is inviting us.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.480]   He goes, I wanna invite everyone to stand.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.720]   And if you've been wondering, you know what,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.560]   whatever it may be, if you feel like, man,
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.760]   I've gotten off track in my faith,
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.480]   maybe I'm not as passionate as I wanna be,
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.600]   maybe I'm totally doing illegal, wrong things,
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.920]   pleasing people, but you know, whatever it may be,
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.920]   I wanna invite you to actually just come right now.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.360]   Jesus is here, just to come to him,
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.800]   to turn to him, to his presence
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   and just to receive his grace and forgiveness again.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.840]   And I wanna encourage you to just,
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.660]   if that's you, just stretch out your hands before,
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.860]   you know, just love to pray over you right now.
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.360]   If you're saying, Jesus, I need you,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:25.820]   I'm sorry, I've wondered, will you show me your grace again?
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.420]   Just stretch out your hand and let me pray over you.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:33.160]   So Jesus, I thank you that you are the God
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.480]   who brings people back on track.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.860]   You meet us in our wondering,
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:41.280]   we're unfaithful, but you are faithful.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:46.120]   You love us and you love showing us your grace.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.920]   You love showing us your goodness.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.040]   And I pray for everyone right now
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.440]   that feels like they've been off track,
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.120]   that you renew them right now through your forgiveness,
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.320]   that you renew them through your grace,
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.520]   through your love, through acceptance,
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.960]   and that you strengthen them.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:07.240]   That you strengthen the resolve to be servants of you,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.760]   to please you.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.520]   I pray that you root them deeper and deeper
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.000]   in your love for them,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.760]   and the identity that you give us as your beloved children.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.560]   I pray, Holy Spirit, that you make that real,
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.720]   that this is something we can feel and we know.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.300]   (gentle music)
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.120]   Thank you, Holy Spirit.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.820]   Thank you for your work right now.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.640]   Thank you, Jesus, for your grace.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.040]   Thank you for your mercy.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:48.800]   Thank you that in you, we can always start anew.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.440]   Doesn't matter what has happened.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:55.440]   So I pray for your blessing over us as a church,
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.320]   that you strengthen us with your grace,
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.480]   that you pour your love over us,
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.600]   I pray this in your name Jesus. Amen. Let's let's worship.
