1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Well, good morning again. How's everyone?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Now I get to be nice.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 I am nice. I'm a nice person.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I hope you received that with the love and the grace that it was given to you guys.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 My favorite movie when I was a kid was the 1985 Steven Spielberg classic, "The Goonies".

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Anyone ever watch "The Goonies" before? Hands in the air.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Alright, you all qualify for the elderly community group here at The Vine.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 You'll get to meet with me later. I'm also a part of that group.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 "The Goonies" came out in 1985 and it literally changed cinema for anybody who grew up in the 80s.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 The reason why I think I love the film so much is because it was about a bunch of boys

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 who were relatively my age when the film came out.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 In fact, these boys right here. This is Chunk, that's Mikey, that's Mouth and Data on the other end.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And this film was fantastic.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 These four boys discover a treasure map in the attic of their house

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 and go on this grand adventure where they discover hidden treasure

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 and they fall against ancient curses. It was cinematic glory.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Now when the film first came out, I was far too young to go to the cinema to actually watch the film.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 But lo and behold, a few months later, TVB here in Hong Kong began to show "The Goonies"

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 as one of its movies on rotation.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But the problem was it came on at 9 o'clock at night and I was still too young.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 My parents would not let me stay up late enough to watch the film.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 This was very frustrating.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 If you wanted to watch a film in those days and you were a kid and you weren't allowed to stay up,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 you would miss out on all of the cinematic glory that God wants you to have.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 You couldn't have it.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 All of that changed one day when my father came home from work

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 carrying a black box under his arms which he placed under the television.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It looked like this.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I thought this was something out of space. It was so cool.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 This, apparently according to my dad, had the power to record anything on television

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 so you can watch it at a later time.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 My dad called it a VCR recorder. I called it God.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 This thing literally changed my childhood.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Suddenly all the things that I couldn't stay up late enough to watch,

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 suddenly these were available to me at the fingertips, including the Goonies,

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 which TVB, just a few months later after dad brought this home, actually aired again on television.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I said to my dad, "Would you please put a tape in the machine?

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Would you set the recording time?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Would you capture the movie so I can come home the next day and watch it for the first time?"

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So my dad got the tape out. He put it in. He set the recording up.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I cannot tell you how excited I was to come home from school that day.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I gathered all my mates from the neighborhood.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 We all got together. We had a little bit of popcorn.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 We put the tape in. We pushed play. And guess what?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 It was the best movie I have ever seen in my life.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 It was amazing. I'd never seen anything quite like it.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 The kids were my age. I was just like, "This was worth waiting for."

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 My favorite scene, trust me, I wore that tape thin.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 I watched it probably over a hundred different times.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 My favorite scene was the very opening scene.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 In the very opening scene of the movie, a black SUV meanders up a very quiet cul-de-sac of a small suburban neighborhood.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It drives past very slowly this beautiful house.

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 The camera pans from the black SUV up to the house,

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 and there's the main star of the film, Mikey, leaning on the window sill of his bedroom.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 He falls back on his bed and he says the opening words of the movie.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 He says, "Oh, bummer. Nothing ever exciting happens around here anyway."

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 It's really ironic because he's about to discover a treasure map in his attic

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 and go on this incredible journey that will change his life,

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 but he knows nothing about that in that moment.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So those opening words from the opening scene is this ironic statement about all that happens,

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 and I thought Steven Spielberg is the greatest director and storyteller ever.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Well, many years later, I'm at university, and I'm living in a house with a bunch of guys,

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and one night we're bored, and so we said to each other, "What should we do?"

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And I said, "I know. Let's rent the Goonies."

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 And we had all watched The Goonies in our youth, but now it was years later,

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 and we wanted to watch it again. We were so excited.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 Now, at that time, it was on the futuristic technology of DVDs,

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 so we rented the DVD of The Goonies.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 By the way, if you've not watched this film, your homework this week is to watch The Goonies.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So we get the DVD, we put it in our little DVD player, we put it in, we push play.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 You will never guess what happened.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 The film had a beginning that I had never seen.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 In fact, the film had five minutes in the beginning that I had never seen before.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I could not believe it, and it suddenly dawned on me

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 that my dad must have set the VCR recorder five minutes later than the beginning of the film.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And so I had missed out on the first five minutes of the greatest film ever made.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And let me tell you, that's not just any five minutes.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 It is the greatest five minutes in cinematic history,

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 because the opening of the film of The Goonies is created and designed by Spielberg

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 to set up everything that comes next.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 I mean, it's crazy what happens in the first five minutes that I had missed.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 There's a fake suicide in a jail cell. There's a breaking out of jail.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 There's a setting fire to the perimeter of the jail.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And then the criminal dives into the back of a vehicle, and guess what that vehicle is?

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 A black SUV, right?

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 He dives into the back of this black SUV, and then they start to break out of jail.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 The whole police in this little town in Washington in the US are trying to chase after them.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And they have this massive car chase all the way through the city.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And whilst the car is being chased by all the police,

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 it introduces us to the main characters of the film.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And by the way that it speeds in and out of all of the town, it destroys so many things.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 It eventually ends up, the black SUV on a beach, and it's trying to get on this beach,

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 and all the police are there, and eventually they manage to get around all of that,

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 and then they take a left-hand turn, and they go into a small, quiet, suburban neighborhood.

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And they drift up the road and turn right, and the camera pans up, and there's Mikey.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And he falls back on his bed, and he says the opening words of the movie.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 "Ah, bummer. I wish I'd seen the first five minutes originally. No."

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 He said, "Ah, bummer. Nothing ever exciting happens here anyway."

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And what I thought were ironic words about what was ahead

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 were actually ironic words about what had already happened.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 And the depth of those words.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I mean, when he's leaning out on that windowsill, and he's looking down on that black SUV,

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 the people in that black SUV are the very ones who are about to change his life forever.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And Spielberg is a master storyteller, and he weaves all of this together.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And I had missed every single bit of it.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And when I finally watched the film from the original beginning,

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 the way that the storyteller wanted me to understand it,

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 it completely changed how I appreciated that movie even more.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 You see, the good stories, the really good stories,

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 always have an intentional purpose to their beginnings.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And the storyteller, as they're trying to unpack these stories for you,

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 begin in a way to shape and form a lens through which they want you to view the rest of the story.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Which means when we get the beginning wrong,

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 when we start the story, if you will, from the wrong place,

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 chances are everything else in that story is going to be distorted from its original intended meaning.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 You have to view the story through the original lens that the storyteller wants you to approach it.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Does that make sense to you?

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And that whole process is never more important than the story we're looking at today,

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 the story of the plagues.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 The plagues are perhaps the most central element that happens in all of the Exodus story.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But they are also the most controversial elements of that story.

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 In the plagues, which are captured for us from chapter 7 through to chapter 12,

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 we see an event after event of God's awesome power on the earth,

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 of God's judgment on the earth.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And in that judgment and in that power,

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 we see the way in which God uses various things and does various things to express his judgment.

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And we see in that things that we're not comfortable with.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And we wrestle with these deep questions of how can a loving God be so violent,

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 do things like that bring that kind of judgment?

130
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I thought God was peaceful and loving and good.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 How would he and why would he do this?

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And if you just grab the Bible and you start in chapter 7 of Exodus,

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 you start reading the plagues, you're going to be weighed down by those questions.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Because you're not actually starting in the place that the storyteller wants you to start.

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 You see, there's some very specific beginnings,

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 intended purposes that God has created and put in the story of Scripture up to the point of the plagues

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 that unless you see it through there, you're going to actually struggle deeply with the narrative.

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Starting in the right place with the plagues is essential for you to understand what they're really trying to say and do.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Now, it doesn't necessarily suddenly magically wipe away some of those big, deep theological questions

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 of the violent nature of God in the Old Testament.

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Those things linger and remain.

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 But seeing it through the right lens enables us to get an understanding of what God's really trying to communicate about himself,

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 about the world, and most importantly, about you.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 About you and your story, you and your Exodus,

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 you and the very thing that you long to depart from.

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And so as we open up the story of the plagues today,

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 I want to open up to you that story through its real beginning.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 That beginning is found in three places.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Two in the book of Genesis and one actually in the book of Exodus itself.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 In the book of Genesis, we see right at the beginning of all things God's creation of the world.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And God's creation of the world in Genesis 1 and 2 is a primary lens through which the storyteller,

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 God and Moses in writing it down, is trying to help you to understand as you go through the plagues.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 What you see in the creation, and I've been saying this over so many weeks of this series,

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 everything that happens in Genesis 1, 2, and 3 is very much what Moses is drawing into his writing of the Exodus.

155
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 The language, the imagery, the way he communicates,

156
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 so much of it pulls from what he had already written in Genesis 1, 2, and 3.

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Now in Genesis 1 and 2, we see some critical things about how God creates.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Let me show you these things.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Light and darkness are separated.

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Creatures of the sea and land are separated.

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 When we come to creation in the Bible, what we're seeing is God saying,

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 "I'm in power and control on creation, and when I create, I put things in their right order.

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 There's an order to the universe, and I separate things so that they would be in their right place and in their right order."

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The pinnacle of this, of course, is the creation of humanity,

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 formed out of the dust itself and breathed on by God's breath and brought into life.

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And that humanity then is given the task to multiply and fill the earth.

167
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 It's like God is saying, "I have ordered creation in a way.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 The pinnacle of that creation is humanity, and I want humanity to be a blessing to my creation."

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And humanity is to multiply and fill the earth and bless and steward the creation that I've given them,

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 which is why the final point here, harmony is secure between humanity, God, and creation,

171
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 because that harmony is God's intent and purpose.

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 What you see at the end of Genesis 1 and 2 is God standing back and saying, "This is very good.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Everything is ordered how I wanted it to be, and I've created humanity so that it can walk with me in bringing harmony and peace,"

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 the biblical word shalom, "to the world that I've created."

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And by the time you get to the end of Genesis 1 and 2, it's like there's a breathing out sigh that everything is just as it should be.

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Make sense? That's your first lens.

177
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Here's the second lens, the creation of Israel.

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 This is found in Genesis 12.

179
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Let me actually read you verses 2 and 3.

180
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 "I will make you"—this is God speaking to Abram—"I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.

182
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I will bless those who bless you. Whoever curses you, I will curse, and all the people on earth will be blessed through you."

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 This is God speaking out over Abram at the starting point of Israel as a nation.

184
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And I want you to see the critical thing here.

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 God is focused on blessing.

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 He's like, "I'm going to bless you. I'm going to make your name great.

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And I'm going to form and shape you in such a way that you're going to be my blessing in the world."

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 In other words, the harmony that is found in Genesis 1 and 2,

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 and the way in which God creates that harmony, that is going to be seen best through how a nation works together.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 A little bit like how I stood before you a moment ago and said,

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 "Here are some cultural things about our community that are important for the world to see the nature of God."

192
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 God creates Israel as a community to represent His nature to the world.

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 "I'll bless you, and you'll be a blessing."

194
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 But notice, "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you, I will curse."

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Very important you understand this.

196
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 What God's saying is, "Out of this nation of Israel, I am going to form and shape them the way that harmony in the world should be,

197
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 the way that my purposes and my promises should be."

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 So those that bless you as a nation are aligning themselves to my purposes and promises,

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 but those that curse you as a nation are standing against my purposes and promises.

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 So the reason why I judge the nations of the world when I judge them,

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 is because they have moved themselves and standing against the purposes and promises I have.

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 How you treat my people will be a representation of what's in your heart.

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Does that make sense?

204
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Now that's a very important lens for us to look through as we get to the plagues.

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 But notice one other thing here. It says, "All the people on earth will be blessed through you."

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 This is so key, because even in the moment of the creation of Israel,

207
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 where God talks about blessings and curses, relationship, and how there is judgment

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 if things are not aligned to his purposes and promises,

209
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 he then immediately provides grace.

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 He says, "All the people of the world will be blessed through this nation, even the ones who curse the nation.

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 If they curse my people, they will be cursed, but cursings can be turned into blessings with God."

212
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Cursings can be turned into blessings with God.

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 And so all the people in all the nations, everybody, will ultimately be blessed.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Now we know in the story that's through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

215
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 But here in Genesis, the idea is that through Israel will come this blessing to all nations,

216
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 and God has provided both judgment and grace.

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Does that make sense to you? Anyone?

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Here's the third lens that the author wants you to look through before you get there.

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 It's the prologue to the plagues themselves in the book of Exodus.

220
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 It's actually found, we read it last week, in Exodus 7.

221
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Let me read you verse 3.

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 This is how God declares the plagues.

223
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 He calls them, "My miraculous signs and wonders."

224
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I love this. Very important you get this.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 God actually declares that the plagues, when he describes them at the very start to Moses and Aaron,

226
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 he's like, "I'm about to do all these plagues, but they are," you need to understand this,

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 "signs and wonders."

228
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 That's how he describes them. They're signs and they're wonders.

229
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And this idea of signs and wonders is a very important thread throughout the whole of the Old Testament.

230
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 A sign was always something that happens that imparted some kind of knowledge about God.

231
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 A wonder was always a supernatural event that was designed to disrupt the ordinary

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 in order to bring a message from God.

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 So a sign imparted some kind of knowledge.

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 A wonder was a shaking up. We sung it in that song.

235
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 "Shake up the ground of my tradition. Shake up the ground of my religion."

236
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 That was what wonders were given for.

237
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 To shake up the ground so that we might come into a re-understanding of the character and the nature of God.

238
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Do you see that?

239
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So when God himself talks about the plagues and lays them up as signs and wonders,

240
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 what he's essentially doing is, "There's something you can learn about me in these plagues,

241
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 and these plagues are to disrupt the ordinary so that something fresh and new,

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 a new message of my heart will be understood."

243
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Now, here's the final thing with the signs and wonders.

244
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Signs and wonders were usually brought through prophets to the kings.

245
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You'll see this later on in the Old Testament narrative once Israel settles itself into the promised land.

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And signs and wonders were the tools of the prophets

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 in order to get kings to change their ways, otherwise judgment will come.

248
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So the plagues, yes, they are acts of judgment.

249
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 But they are also signs and wonders provided by God to offer grace to his people and to Egypt

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 to turn from their ways before the true final judgment comes.

251
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 The plagues are actually God's way of saying, "Will you listen? Will you see?

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Will you understand the story behind the story, or will you begin the movie five minutes in?"

253
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Now, the way that Egypt had set up their film is they didn't want the movie of Yahweh at all.

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 For them, they had come up with their own system of understanding, harmony in the world.

255
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And what we see in Genesis 3 is really important because we see this in the nature of Egypt at that time.

256
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Genesis 3, Satan comes to Adam and Eve and says, "You can take this fruit and you can eat it.

257
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And in doing so, you'll discover that there's other ways of thinking about the world

258
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 than the way that God has created you to think about it."

259
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And Adam and Eve are tempted to take that fruit because they believe that God is holding out on them,

260
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 that there is an alternative way of worship.

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And what you see, fast forward in all the years when you get to Egypt,

262
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 is that Egypt is living out an empire of an alternative way of worshiping.

263
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They have a pantheon of gods that they have constructed in order to keep control over the workings of humanity.

264
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And that pantheon of gods has created an environment where absolutely everything in Egypt's society

265
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 was all down to the worship of various different idols in order to retain harmony in the world.

266
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Very interestingly, harmony becomes a central part to Egyptian religious belief.

267
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 So when God shows up with the plagues, he's actually trying to subvert this alternative idea of worship

268
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 and bring his people back to the way things had always intended to be.

269
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 And he does that through some pretty dramatic things.

270
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And to help you to understand and see all of that, let me take you once again to the land of Egypt.

271
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The one central driving force of ancient Egyptian life was religion.

272
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 The Egyptians believed in a pantheon of gods, which were involved in all aspects of nature and human society.

273
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 The gods quite literally were everywhere.

274
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And in order to have a successful life for yourself and for your family,

275
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 you needed to expertly navigate a complex system of beliefs and rituals,

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 using prayer and offerings to interact with the various gods in control of the world around you.

277
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 All of which meant ensuring a prosperous life for yourself and those around you.

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Well, it was actually really exhausting.

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I mean, could you imagine being surrounded every day by these deities and these gods

280
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 constantly reminding yourself of your need to be in harmonious relationship with them?

281
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And it's this concept of harmony that was actually central to ancient Egyptian religion.

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 See, core to their beliefs was a concept known as Ma'at.

283
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 This was a cosmic eternal order, a little bit similar to our modern day concepts of truth and justice,

284
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 but found in the cosmos as well as human society.

285
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And ancient Egyptians believed that their sole purpose was actually to maintain Ma'at in the universe.

286
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And they did this through their relationship with the gods, by their various offerings, their daily rituals,

287
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 all of which were designed to starve off disorder and ensure harmony remained.

288
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And here is what is key in all of that.

289
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Any threat to the cosmic order was not just a threat to the person themselves, but a threat to the whole universe.

290
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And a threat like that needed to be dealt with in one of two ways,

291
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 either aggressively suppressed or ideally completely wiped out.

292
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 So imagine what it would have been like if you were a Jewish slave in the land at that time.

293
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I mean, you would have been raised to believe that there was only one God in the universe, Yahweh,

294
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 who could hold all of Ma'at in his hands.

295
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 And yet every single day you would have constantly been reminded that actually that is a stupid idea,

296
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 that instead thousands of gods are needed to maintain harmony in the universe.

297
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And in this way, Egypt's slavery of God's people was actually more than just a physical oppression.

298
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 It was a spiritual oppression as well.

299
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Everything Egypt could do was designed to mock the one central question of the whole of the Jewish faith.

300
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Could it really be that one God is able to hold the whole universe in power at one time?

301
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Well, that question and the freedom the answer brings is what the plagues are all about.

302
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And to understand that, I need to take us now back to the waters of the Nile.

303
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 If maintaining Ma'at in the universe was the primary aim of Egyptian religion,

304
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 no single source of such harmony was more powerfully symbolized than by the life-giving power of the Nile River.

305
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 The Nile was everything for ancient Egyptians,

306
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 a source of human life through its fish for eating and its waters for drinking,

307
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and in its annual flooding a source of cosmic life to all nature around it.

308
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 The Nile was Egypt's strongest demonstration of the balance and order that existed between the gods and people.

309
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 If its waters remained healthy, so would its people.

310
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 It should not surprise us then that this is the very first place God calls Moses and Aaron to come

311
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 in order to display his cosmic power.

312
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 See, God tells Moses to instruct Aaron to stretch out his hand and staff,

313
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 touch the water, and turn it into blood,

314
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 thereby killing all of the fish and creating such a stench

315
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 that people won't come to drink from here from that point forward.

316
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And we have to see the story behind the story here.

317
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 You see, God's first act of convincing Pharaoh to let the Israelites go

318
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 is designed to strike at the very heart of Egyptian religious belief.

319
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 God disrupts the Ma'at of the universe in order to demonstrate that the only Ma'at is found in him.

320
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 The rest of the plagues follow suit.

321
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Each one is a specific statement from Yahweh that he is far more powerful than any of the many gods of Egypt.

322
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 So the plague of frogs is a demonstration against Heket, the frog goddess of fertility.

323
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 The flies against Kepri, the fly god of Egypt.

324
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 The plague of hell against Nut, the god of the atmosphere.

325
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 The darkness against Ra, the Egyptian god of the sun.

326
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And with each plague comes a consistent message.

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 This one single god, Yahweh, is the one and only true God,

328
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 and all other pretenses the deity must bow down.

329
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It would be this constant display of God's power over and above the power of the gods of Egypt

330
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 that would eventually soften Pharaoh's heart and bring him to his decision to finally let the Israelites go.

331
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And we see in this process and God's involvement in it,

332
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 something very important for all of our journeys in Exodus.

333
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 You see, God understands that in order to break the chains of our physical oppression,

334
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 we have to first of all break the chains of our spiritual oppression.

335
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 We have to know that there is a God who's got greater power than anything in the universe,

336
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 and through that find faith rising up in us to stand against anything that attempts to chain us.

337
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 See, God reveals his true power to Israel and their journey in freedom begins.

338
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 May it also be so for you.

339
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 I want to help you to see that journey of freedom for you by mapping out very briefly the plagues.

340
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 There are 10 of them in total.

341
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 The 10th one is the one that's perhaps the most shocking,

342
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 the one that's perhaps the most difficult to deal with,

343
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 and that's the one that we'll deal with next week, thankfully.

344
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And that's all on the Passover and what God does there.

345
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 But the other nine plagues that we see are actually broken into three different cycles.

346
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Let me show you a diagram.

347
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 I know I told you earlier to put your phones away,

348
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 but you can get them out for just a brief term and take a photo of this slide if you would like,

349
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 because this is a very helpful—I'll get out of your way a little bit—

350
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 but this is a very helpful slide if you want to study a little bit more around the cycles of the plagues.

351
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 So as I mentioned earlier, they're found from chapter 7 through to chapter 12.

352
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 What you'll see here is that there are three separate cycles of in total nine plagues.

353
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 There are the Scriptures they have,

354
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 particularly the Egyptian gods that each of those plagues are against and bringing a polemic against are there,

355
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 but also, very importantly, God's intention about what he's trying to communicate about himself in each of those cycles.

356
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And I'll explain that a little bit more in a moment.

357
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 But I want you to see something, first of all.

358
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 One of the things that God is doing through the lens that we looked at with the creation of the world in Genesis 1 and 2,

359
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 his judgment against what Egypt are doing through their pantheon of gods

360
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 is a judgment which basically results in his de-creation of the world.

361
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 So actually, and this is fascinating, all of the plagues are a de-creation event

362
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 that mirrors a creative event that happened in Genesis 1 and 2,

363
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 because what God is trying to do is basically say, "I need to de-create in order to then free Israel to create again Israel in the way that they'll be going forward."

364
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 So all of these are de-creative events.

365
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Let me give you an example. The frogs.

366
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Remember I said that there was a separation between the earth, the land, or sorry, the sea and the land.

367
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 There's a separation between those two things.

368
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Well, with the plague of frogs, frogs are the ones that have the ability to go on both land and in both water.

369
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And God brings a plague of frogs to cover the earth between the waters and the ground

370
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 in order to de-construct what he had done in Genesis 1 and 2.

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Likewise, the gnats. We're told that in the gnats plague, God takes dust and he creates the gnats out of the dust.

372
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 In the same way that he had taken dust in Genesis 1 and 2 and created humanity,

373
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 now he creates gnats to show the chaos that comes when you try to do things in a different way.

374
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 These all follow suit. The flies, for example.

375
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Actually, when Moses writes about the plague of flies, he says they multiply and fill the earth.

376
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 The same language he uses about God's call on humanity in Genesis 1 and 2.

377
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Again, God is de-creating in order to futurely create.

378
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 The plague of darkness on cycle 3.

379
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Again, God had separated light and darkness.

380
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Now in the plagues, God brings darkness in the middle of the day to once again de-construct

381
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 in order to say, "I'm going to do things differently."

382
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And his main communication is, "If you have any other form of worship,

383
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 any other way of thinking about harmony, it is not true.

384
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 It will only bring more chaos, and I show you that chaos in judgment of the other form of worship that you have."

385
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Notice, though, on the right side here, God's intervention.

386
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Remember that God describes his plagues as signs and wonders.

387
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 In each cycle of plagues, God is actually saying something about himself to Egypt and to Israel.

388
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 In the first cycle, he says, "By this you shall know that I am the Lord."

389
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 In other words, I'm inviting you into this intimate, personal relationship with me,

390
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 and you would know that I am a true God, the one and only true God.

391
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And I do these things in order to shake up, remember, disrupt your ordinary

392
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 to bring you into a knowledge that I am the one true God.

393
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 In cycle two, he says, "That you may know that I am the Lord, and I am in the midst of the land."

394
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 This is really important, because Yahweh is basically saying,

395
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "I'm not some god, the pantheon of the Egyptian gods where deities removed."

396
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 God is saying, "I'm in the land itself. I'm here with you.

397
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 I'm not distant. I'm not on some fluffy cloud trying to manipulate the world in some way.

398
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I'm actually present and with you. I am a God who is in the land itself."

399
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And that differentiates himself from all of the pantheon of Egyptian gods.

400
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And then in cycle three, he says, "So that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth."

401
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 No other God. Everything else is a pretense to authority.

402
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 The only authority is me. You would know through this that I am the only God,

403
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 that none of your magicians can create any of the plagues in the way that I can.

404
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 I am the one true, powerful God, and all other pretenses to authority must bow down.

405
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 The lens through which we approach the plagues enables us to see that God is actually offering to Egypt

406
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 the fullness of who he is. You don't need those hundreds of gods.

407
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 You don't need to live in a stressed way where you're trying to please everything around you.

408
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 You just need me. And I'm not just distant, but I'm present.

409
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I'm in the land. And everything else submits to me.

410
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I'm the one who holds all my ite in my hands.

411
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 And you can find escape from the pressures of trying to chase everything else with just your worship of me.

412
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And some of you in this room, that's a word for you.

413
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Because God is saying the same thing to you today through the plague narrative.

414
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 You don't need all this other stuff. All these other little ways in which you worship.

415
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 All these other little idols that you're bowing down to.

416
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 All this other stuff of culture that you think you need to fit into in order to succeed.

417
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 The only thing you need for true power, for true authority, true harmony, true peace is me.

418
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 And for some of you, that's a call of God on you today.

419
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 So through the plagues and all of this, what is it that the people learn?

420
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Well, here's what Egypt learns.

421
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 They learn that there is one God who can hold all my ite in his hands.

422
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And they better bow down to that one God. Otherwise, things won't go well for them.

423
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Pharaoh, his heart is hardened and he hardens his heart with everything.

424
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 His pride gets in the way. And eventually, as we'll see next week,

425
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 he finally lets Israel go through the work of the Passover and the death of the firstborn sons of Egypt.

426
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 But all of that process is building the pressure on Egypt to see that there is only one true God

427
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 that holds my ite in all his hands.

428
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 But every single plague, there's an opportunity for them to turn.

429
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Every single plague, there's an opportunity for them to respond to this God

430
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 and give their lives and their authority and their worship to him.

431
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Israel also learns a lot.

432
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 They learn that after having spent so many years in Egypt,

433
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 they had naturally begun to worship some of those deities of Egypt.

434
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I mean, can you imagine, like I said in the film, being surrounded by all those gods all the time?

435
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Well, you would have felt that pressure to align yourself to the culture of your time.

436
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And the plagues is a wonder to them.

437
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 It's a thing that disrupts their ordinary and helps them to realize,

438
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 "Hang on a sec, what are we doing? Why are we worshiping all these other gods

439
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 when there is only one God, the God of our forefather, of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?

440
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 That's the God we should worship."

441
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And the plagues actually work for Israel as a shaking up of their ground

442
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 so that they can remember the true God that they were always called to worship.

443
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 But the plagues also do something else for Israel.

444
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 They enable them to realize that Moses and Aaron are actually not false prophets.

445
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Remember what happened in Exodus chapter 5.

446
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Moses and Aaron had gone before Pharaoh and said, "Let my people go."

447
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And Pharaoh had gone, "I'm not going to do that."

448
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 It makes their slavery even worse.

449
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And up until this point, all of Israel thinks Moses and Aaron are false prophets.

450
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 They don't really speak on behalf of Yahweh.

451
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 The plagues demonstrate to all the Israelites

452
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 that Moses and Aaron are actually speaking on the mouthpiece of God,

453
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 that they are true representatives of Yahweh, and that they should follow them.

454
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 So the plagues actually work as a uniting movement for Israel

455
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 around the leadership of Moses and Aaron,

456
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 something that is critical for everything that's going to happen next in the story.

457
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 But what about for Moses?

458
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 What does Moses learn?

459
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Moses learns that despite the fact that he has been raised as a prince of Egypt,

460
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 and despite the fact that he would have been incredibly talented

461
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 in knowing how to worship the variety of gods in Egypt,

462
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 and despite the fact that he'd had 40 years in the wilderness,

463
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 he was still carrying some of the residue of that identity.

464
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And the plagues was God's disruptive way to once and for all say to Moses,

465
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 "You have to let that stuff go."

466
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 See, one of the things that Moses discovers is, I think,

467
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 a central story of the whole of the Exodus journey, and it's this,

468
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 that the call to let my people go was not just a call to Egypt

469
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 about releasing God's people from their slavery.

470
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 It was actually a call to Israel about releasing themselves from their idolatry.

471
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Come on, church.

472
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 This is actually what the plagues are about for Israel.

473
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 God is saying, "There are idols that you're holding in your hearts,

474
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 and I'm demonstrating to you that I'm only the one true God,

475
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 and you getting out of Egypt is only half the battle.

476
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 The other part of the battle is you letting go of Egypt,

477
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 you letting go of the idolatry that you have become accustomed to,

478
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 because I just want you."

479
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 And Moses sees in the plagues the disgusting reality of the idolatry of his people.

480
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And in that, a longing is birthed within Israel

481
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 to have a pure relationship with God again.

482
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 And all of that is critical for them to move into the wilderness

483
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 and meet with God at Mount Sinai.

484
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 But as I close, everybody's favorite words in a sermon,

485
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 what is it that you learn through all of this?

486
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 What is it that you can take away and reflect around?

487
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 What is it that changes in your life because of the plagues?

488
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Well, first of all, I think the plagues help us to understand

489
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 that despite how it might look at times,

490
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 God is at work behind the scenes in the corridors of power in this world.

491
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 That God is the one who's ultimately in control.

492
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 He is the one who ultimately has the authority on heaven and on earth.

493
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And sometimes it's easy for us to look at the way things are

494
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 in terms of the power structures of this world.

495
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 It's easier for us to look at the ones who govern us or lead us

496
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 and think that there's no way that anything good could ever come of that.

497
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 And what the plague narrative reminds us is that ultimately,

498
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 God is in control of everything that happens in the world.

499
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 And that God brings signs and wonders at times

500
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 to bring his world back into relationship with him.

501
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 And that should encourage us.

502
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 We should see the plagues and have faith rise in us

503
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 that God will always hold governments to account

504
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 for how they govern their people.

505
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 That God will always work towards justice in this world.

506
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 And as his people, we get the opportunity to lean into that with our prayers,

507
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 lean into that with our trust, lean into that and say,

508
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 "Even though I don't see how this election is going to happen

509
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 or how this is going to work or how this is going to happen

510
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 or how this injustice is going to change,

511
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 I believe that God is not blind to it.

512
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 I believe that God cares about it.

513
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 I believe that God is involved in it and he's doing stuff

514
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 that I don't even understand, I don't even see.

515
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 And my role is just to come alongside, to pray, to believe, to stand, to speak,

516
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 to be his voice and his mouthpiece because he's a God of justice and he's at work."

517
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 And the cool should be on the church to rise up

518
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 and say that we believe that God is at work,

519
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 even when it feels like the opposite.

520
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 The second thing I think you can take away is the knowledge

521
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 that God is at war against the idols that are in your life.

522
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 God is at war against anything that will take your heart away from him,

523
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 anything that will distract you and hold you hostile

524
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 to God's good purposes in your life.

525
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 God has an unrelenting passion to see freedom come for his people.

526
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 And I want you to hear this.

527
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 God is not just interested in your freedom.

528
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 He also wants your heart.

529
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 And for God, if he doesn't get your whole heart,

530
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 then you will never truly be free.

531
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 See, the purpose of the Exodus is not to get you out of some bad stuff

532
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 that's happened to you in the past.

533
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 It's not just about freeing you from some chains that are around you.

534
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 The point of the Exodus and the point brought to us through the power of the plagues

535
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 is that God doesn't want to just draw you out.

536
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 He wants to draw you in.

537
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 He wants to engage with you, be in relationship with you, know you more.

538
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 He wants your heart not split between all these different things.

539
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 He wants your whole heart, because it's only in your wholehearted devotion of him,

540
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 your wholehearted worship of him, that you'll ever find yourself truly free

541
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 and therefore find yourself in harmony, in shalom,

542
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 with the way that you've always been created to be.

543
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Does that make sense to you?

544
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 God is passionate not just about your freedom, but about where your heart is.

545
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 And any time that our hearts are connected to idols, we're not truly free.

546
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Which is the third and final thing I think you should take away with you.

547
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 And this should encourage you deeply.

548
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 God stands powerfully against every demonic force in this world.

549
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 If there's anything you take away from today,

550
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 may it be that whatever strategy that the enemy has over you,

551
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 your family, your marriage, you yourself, whatever it might be,

552
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 God is at work right here, right now,

553
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 fighting against the demonic forces of this world.

554
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 And that's ultimately seen, of course, in the life, death, and the resurrection of Jesus.

555
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 It's ultimately seen in the blood that is shed in Jesus,

556
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 which we're going to talk about next week, and you're going to see the power in that.

557
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 But before we get to next week, know in this moment,

558
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 that God stands against every demonic realm and every demonic force,

559
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 and he stands against it, and he says, "Let my people go."

560
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 And I wonder whether you could hear the resonance of God's voice

561
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 over you and over your life, where he stands against any principality,

562
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 and any darkness that's trying to have any influence over you, your kids, your family,

563
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 whatever it might be, and he's standing and he's saying to those things,

564
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 "Let this person go. Let this one go, because this one is my child."

565
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 And God has an unrelenting, unbridled fury of love for you and your freedom.

566
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 And he will bring that against any pretense to authority and power

567
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 with such fury, a fury passioned by love, not by wrath, but by love,

568
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 to stand with you and say, "I will do these things for you, over you,

569
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 where you're not even realizing it, whilst you sleep, and behind the scenes,

570
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 because I want you free, and there is no weapon formed against you that will prosper."

571
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 The plagues are God's way of saying to his people,

572
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 "There is no weapon formed against you that will prosper."

573
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 And if there's anything you take from today,

574
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 may it be a sense of the fighting power of God on your behalf.

575
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 And I want you to feel it. I want you to see it.

576
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 The plagues are not nice. They're not easy. They raise big questions.

577
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 They're a fireball of the fury of God's love for his creation.

578
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 A fireball that stands against any other pretense to worship,

579
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 any other system that would say there's another way,

580
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 any other Satan that speaks to Adam and Eve and says,

581
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 "Take this fruit, because this is better."

582
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 God's plagues are a picture to us of this unrelenting fire that God has

583
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 to say, "The way that I have created, the way that I am, is the only way to true peace for you."

584
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 And he wants you to know him that way,

585
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 to know that you're protected, fought for, redeemed, saved, and set free.

586
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 And that passion, I want you to feel now.

587
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 To help you with that, take a look at this.

588
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Let my people go.

589
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 These wild, wild fires,

590
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 raving and burning, consuming, hardened by the fury of heaven.

591
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 Stars become snakes, snakes become slaves,

592
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 dressed in the chains of tomorrow's grave.

593
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 The power of fear, blood in the water,

594
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 the stench of injustice now torn from another.

595
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 Skies become flies, flies become hail, hammering the hardened with the holiest of nails.

596
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 A stretching of hands, a rage from the heavens.

597
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 Darkness descended, darkness descended.

598
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Now blood on the doorpost, an angel of death.

599
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 The horror of genocide not far from our lips.

600
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 A heaven of fury, burning and breaking.

601
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 The hardened consumed with words still shaking.

602
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 Let my people go.

603
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 That's how he feels for you.

604
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 I wonder whether you'd just open your hands.

605
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 Come Holy Spirit.

606
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 You are loved, accepted, fought for.

607
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 God has sent his son to the cross,

608
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 to stand in the place where you should have stood.

609
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 And with the fury of love, cast sin upon him,

610
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 so you would know true life.

611
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 You now stand more than a conqueror.

612
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 And whatever idol or idols that are present in your heart,

613
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 the forgiveness and the mercy of God is like what we just witnessed.

614
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 It can be uncomfortable at times.

615
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 And I know firsthand that God has sent me signs and wonders

616
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 to bring me to repentance.

617
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 And God brings his justice.

618
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 And I pray that you would, through this understanding of the plagues today,

619
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 leave this place knowing the price that has been paid,

620
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 but also the power that there is that stands alongside of you.

621
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 That the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is now in you.

622
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 That same power, that same love, that same authority, it's in you.

623
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 And although the plagues are uncomfortable,

624
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 and they raise lots of questions that we have to wrestle with,

625
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 ultimately, seeing through the lens that the storyteller provides for us,

626
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 they are an invitation to less of our idols and more of God.

627
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 And I pray, in this moment and in the moments ahead for you this week,

628
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 that you would continue to make that exchange

629
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 by simply coming before him

630
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 and saying the one powerful prayer in scripture that the whole Bible ends with.

631
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 It's "Maranatha". It means "Come, Lord Jesus".

632
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 And Father, I pray for anyone here who needs to lay down idols,

633
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 you would show them how to do that.

634
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 And I pray every person here would invite more of you into their lives.

635
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Come, Lord Jesus. Come.

636
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Come, Lord Jesus. Come.

637
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 And we thank you for this. In Jesus' name.

638
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Amen.

639
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 We love you.
