[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240]   - Thank you, Carla.
[00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.300]   Congratulations to all the baptism candidates.
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.760]   What a wonderful day to celebrate together.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.240]   And so yeah, as Carla said, over the past five weeks,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.520]   we've been exploring right through the Old Testament,
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.040]   these encounters with God.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.840]   And through looking at the different characters
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.720]   and the encounters they've had,
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.920]   the hope is that you've been challenged,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.920]   you've been inspired, and hopefully even changed
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.180]   as you start to apply some of these things
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.620]   that we've been talking about into your own life.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.680]   The whole heart behind this series was that,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.160]   you know, right at the beginning of the year,
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.140]   I'm not sure if you remember,
[00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.400]   the word spoken over us by the Lord was intimacy.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.200]   And these encounters prove that God is a God
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.920]   that wants to be close to us,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.260]   that wants us to be close to him,
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.680]   that wants to reveal things about himself to us
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.380]   so that we can get to know him.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.920]   However, and this is the other side of the coin,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.400]   being close to God, encountering him in all we do,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.680]   knowing and feeling the love of Jesus
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.160]   is not necessarily the end goal
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.920]   of what it means to call yourself a Christian.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.240]   And yes, over the summer, right,
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.360]   we've had some incredible moments in this room,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.120]   even this morning today.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.600]   There have been times where we've been worshiping
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.760]   when it feels like we're worshiping
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.560]   with the angels themselves in heaven, right?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.240]   Just really passionate, intimate moments of worship.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.520]   There have been stories and testimonies shared
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.440]   where we've been moved,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.880]   it's been encouraging for our souls.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.560]   You've heard sermons, hopefully that you've said,
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.720]   "Yes, that's a word for me, that's so good,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.680]   "I really resonate with that."
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.000]   We've been growing with numbers, as you can see,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.760]   we're busting at the seams with overflow sometimes,
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.680]   community groups have been going.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   All this shows, yes, there has been sort of life
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.360]   in the church, and we thank God for this,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.240]   and it's amazing and it's a blessing,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.360]   but it makes being part of this community so exciting.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.760]   Coming here on a Sunday is an amazing experience
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.320]   that we all get to enjoy together.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.240]   But still, this is not the main goal.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.560]   Because if all we've done is created life
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.000]   inside this building, inside the church,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.120]   I feel like we've been missing one of the key parts
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.640]   of what it means to be called a disciple,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.520]   to be called a follower of Jesus.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.560]   And in fact, if this is all that we've achieved,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.120]   maybe we've been wasting our time even,
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.260]   and God might not be as pleased with us
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.400]   as we think that he is.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.880]   And we risk missing out on one of the main points,
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.600]   one of the most glorious things about what it means
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.340]   to be a disciple, to be a follower of Jesus.
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.880]   So what is this point I'm talking about?
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.600]   Well, you may have noticed that each time
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.840]   our Bible characters as an encounter with God,
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.280]   there is a mission, there is a greater purpose
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.320]   that goes along with it.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.300]   It's not just for that person's benefit.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.700]   In fact, as you've been led through the series,
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.320]   most of the time, it's at great cost and inconvenience
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.800]   for that person, great sacrifice for that person
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.080]   who God encounters.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.880]   But there's always a bigger impact to those around them.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.720]   We didn't look at the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.600]   I saved us from that, 'cause Jeremiah is a key example
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.400]   of a prophet that encounters God, God speaks to him,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.360]   and he hates it, actually.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.920]   But he's like, "Stop speaking to me, Lord.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.080]   "I can't take this."
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.000]   But it feels like there's a fire inside his bones.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.760]   You know that Bible verse.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.960]   Because God has spoken to him,
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.480]   he can't help but speak it back out.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.760]   But it's not a comfortable position for him to be in.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.580]   With Jacob, we see he wrestles with God.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.360]   But the greater impact was to inspire
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.840]   the birth of a new nation.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.360]   For Joshua, he encounters God,
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.480]   but the bigger part of that was to prove to the Canaanites
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.800]   that God is the only one true God.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.360]   For Daniel, as he wrestles with King Darius
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.920]   and he gets thrown into the lion's den,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.880]   he encounters God in the lion's den.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.280]   The bigger impact that comes from that
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.240]   is the decree that comes at the end
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   where the whole kingdom, king degrees,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.720]   has to now worship God.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.120]   For Elijah, it was a reminder to turn the Israelites
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.960]   back to God away from idol worship.
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   For Hannah, it was the call for her to,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.920]   she did eventually give birth to a child,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.800]   but then she turns around and sacrifices
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.960]   and gives that child back to the Lord.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.980]   And so it's the same for us today.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.040]   We don't want to encounter God
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   so that the church on Sundays can be this amazing gathering
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.320]   that we get to enjoy this week, each week.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.200]   Yes, it's a privilege we get to do this,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.880]   but what we really should be asking for
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.640]   is for God to encounter us so that he can use this body
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.080]   to work through his church, to disrupt our lives,
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.840]   to enter out of our wills and purposes
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.200]   so that he can be made known to others.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.740]   That is what we're trying to do here this morning.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.500]   God's heart is that we would encounter him
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.800]   so that we can make him known to everyone else.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.860]   Psalm 46 makes this point well.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.760]   Okay, Bible quiz for one second, okay?
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.700]   Finish this verse, "Be still and know that I am God."
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.380]   What comes next?
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.020]   But you know that's not the end of this verse, right?
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.740]   But we sing this song, right, the song "Still,"
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.780]   and we feel God close to us, but the proper end,
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.660]   this is not the end of this verse.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.620]   So it sort of misses the point.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.700]   Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing on "Still," okay?
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.300]   It's one of my favorite songs, I love that song.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.620]   It's carried me through some deep seasons
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.300]   of trouble in my life.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.260]   But the entirety of that verse reads like this.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.020]   "Be still and know that I am God.
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.480]   "I will be exalted among the nations.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.100]   "I will be exalted in the earth."
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.820]   In other words, church is not about us.
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.980]   What God is really saying here is,
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.140]   be still and let me know that I'm close to you.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.780]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.620]   But what he's saying is,
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.900]   be still so that you can see I am God
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.940]   that is exalted over everything in this world, right?
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.220]   And that hits a little bit different
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.220]   when we look at it from that perspective
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.780]   in its entire context.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.300]   Because it's not just about knowing God,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.420]   it's about making him known.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.940]   And all this talk about encountering God,
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.580]   yes, it should give you a deeper appreciation of God,
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.700]   a more intimate relationship with him.
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.340]   Yes, it should have strengthened your faith,
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.460]   but at the same time,
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.940]   it should have also given you a deeper love for others.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.240]   Because this is God's heart for the world.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.900]   It should have also led you to a desire
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.500]   to let other people know about him.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.460]   It should have motivated you to think like,
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.060]   oh my goodness, God is so good, God is so amazing.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.140]   This encounter I've had has been so powerful,
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.020]   I cannot possibly keep it to myself anymore.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.860]   I have to tell someone about this.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.140]   All people everywhere, all the time,
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.180]   need to know who God is.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.940]   And I'm not gonna give myself rest
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.980]   until everyone knows out there
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.060]   that there is a God exalted over everything in this world.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.900]   Amen?
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.020]   This is what our purpose is.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.460]   This is what the church is for.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.860]   In fact, this is so important to God's heart.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.140]   Jesus' last words before he went into heaven
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.740]   was a command to make this happen.
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.260]   Jesus says, "All authority in heaven and on earth
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.620]   "has been given to me.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.200]   "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.160]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.820]   "and of the Son of the Holy Spirit,
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.720]   "and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.700]   "and surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age."
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.300]   The Great Commission, Matthew 28.
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.620]   In another version of this, he says it like this.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.920]   "But you will receive power
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.460]   "when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.520]   "and you will be my witnesses, my declarers,
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.060]   "in Jerusalem, in Judea, and Samaria,
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.780]   "and to the ends of the earth."
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.620]   Acts 1:8.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.020]   Right, notice what Jesus didn't say.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.060]   He didn't say the last thing he said.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.620]   You know, "Hey, don't forget to come to church every Sunday."
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.440]   Right?
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.280]   That's not what he said.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.740]   He didn't say, "Hey, don't forget to join up
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.660]   "to the community groups."
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.480]   He didn't say, "Don't forget to give your tithes
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.780]   "and your offerings."
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.300]   His last and final instructions were to go.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.440]   Go and tell people about me.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.040]   Go and tell people who God is.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.860]   Go and be a witness to people
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.740]   about your encounters with me.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.860]   Make disciples, baptize them,
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.300]   teach them what I've taught you.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.660]   These are verbs, these are action words
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.860]   called for us to go and do.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.100]   So the question today is,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.660]   are we doing the work of making disciples?
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.480]   Are we proclaiming to Jesus
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.020]   is to those who don't know him yet?
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.540]   Are we taking action to make Jesus known to everyone?
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.940]   And how do we do this, church?
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.660]   We do this by preaching the word.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.500]   If we want God to be lifted high in this world,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.060]   if we want Jesus to be exalted as a name above all names,
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.320]   we, as his children, as his body, have to preach the word.
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.520]   And this is the challenge from scripture
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.980]   for all of us today.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.080]   Now, I'm not gonna try and sugarcoat anything
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.600]   because it is a massive challenge.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.400]   But I believe it's one that we are all,
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.020]   every single person in this room, is called to respond to.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.760]   It's a challenge that if we can commit
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.480]   to doing our very best to meet it,
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.460]   this will be the kind of community,
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.660]   the kind of society, the kind of church
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.080]   that Jesus is looking for.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.300]   That's my introduction, okay?
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.700]   So let's look at today's passage.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.000]   I'm reading from 2 Timothy 4, one to five.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.840]   It says this.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.920]   In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.600]   who will judge the living and the dead,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.780]   and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.160]   I give you this charge.
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.000]   I give you this charge.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.160]   Preach the word.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.920]   Be prepared in season and out of season.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.960]   Correct, rebuke, encourage with great patience
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.400]   and careful instruction.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.680]   For the time will come when people
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   will not put up with sound doctrine.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.280]   Instead, to suit their own desires,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.520]   they will gather around with them a great number of teachers
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.760]   to say what their itching ears want to hear.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   They will turn their ears away from the truth
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.120]   and turn aside to myths.
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.320]   But you, keep your head in all situations.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.000]   Endure hardship.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Do the work of an evangelist.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.680]   Discharge all the duties of your ministry.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.520]   Okay, this is good, I think.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.660]   No one's running out the door so far, okay.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.820]   So I'm gonna take it as, if you're sitting here
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.800]   continuing to listen, I'm gonna take it as
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.480]   thinking that you mean everyone's buying in.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.520]   You're saying yes, we want to learn
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.720]   what it means to do this.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.620]   Together we want to preach God's word.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.400]   So we'll get to that in a minute.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.280]   But before Paul gets to the how, how do we do this,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.360]   first he gives us a sense of why.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.220]   And the why is actually quite,
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.860]   it's a good reminder for us.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.200]   The why is because time is running out.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.020]   Paul starts his charge with a sense of urgency.
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.700]   He's telling us, this isn't something we can save for later.
[00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.040]   This isn't something that you put on the back burner.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.500]   It's not a slow cooker moment.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.100]   We'll wait and check on it later to see what happens.
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.940]   Preaching the word is a challenge
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.980]   that needs to be responded to today, right now.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.800]   Time is of the essence.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.300]   He says it like this, in the presence of God
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.760]   and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.120]   and in view of his appearing and his kingdom,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.560]   I give you this charge.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.040]   As Paul was writing this letter,
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.520]   he's writing to a young protégé,
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.160]   a young follower, disciple of his, called Timothy.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.520]   And during the time of Paul's writing,
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.960]   he's in deep trouble, actually.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.400]   He's imprisoned because of his dedication
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.360]   to preaching the gospel.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.680]   And this time, he seems to be aware
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.400]   that his time on earth is limited.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.080]   He feels like he could be executed any moment now.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.640]   He's had a few run-ins with the law.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.360]   He's been in prison a bunch of times.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.840]   But this time, he just senses,
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.040]   he just knows something is different.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.280]   I don't have much time left, so I have to tell you this.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.940]   But this is also a reminder for us.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.840]   Now, I'm not sure how often you think
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.000]   about the brevity of life.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.560]   I know it's a bit of a morbid thing to think about,
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.920]   but probably day to day,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.160]   hopefully it's not something we focus on too much.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.360]   It kind of gets us down.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.320]   But as your day goes past, the sun goes up,
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.880]   the sun goes down.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   We live our lives.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   We wake up, brush your teeth, hopefully,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.080]   have breakfast, get ready to work,
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.840]   drop the kids off at school,
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.920]   argue with your partner over what to have for dinner,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.600]   send memes to your bestie on Instagram,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.840]   go shopping, do exercise,
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.360]   decide what to watch on Netflix,
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.200]   and then fall asleep in front of the TV, right?
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.720]   All the day to day routine of things.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.640]   Occasionally, we might look to the future and say,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.640]   okay, I'm gonna go on holiday here or there sometime.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.480]   But here's the reality, church.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.320]   The reality is tomorrow is not guaranteed for any of us.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:23.320]   Everyone's time on this earth could end at any moment.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.480]   And when that happens, we find ourselves,
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.920]   we're going to find ourselves face to face with Jesus.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.200]   Life on earth will end in two ways.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.720]   Either your body will stop working
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.240]   and there's a whole bunch of stuff
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.200]   that can cause that to happen,
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.480]   or Jesus comes back and nobody apart from the Father
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.280]   knows when exactly that's gonna be.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.200]   The truth is, we don't know.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.440]   We'll never know how close we are to the final day
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.800]   until it actually hits us.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.280]   Which is why the Bible tells us to be careful how we live.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   Which is why it tells us where we're to live each day
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.680]   as people ready to meet Jesus face to face.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.520]   Because when we do meet him face to face,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.520]   we have to be ready because that means
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.720]   it's time for judgment, right?
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.280]   We're gonna meet Jesus face to face.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.720]   Either he's gonna come back to fully reclaim this earth,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.120]   and when we do see him,
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.040]   there's gonna be some questions he's gonna ask us.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.160]   He's coming back, it says,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.200]   to judge the living and the dead.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.240]   So what's he gonna judge us on?
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.880]   Well, he's gonna ask us questions, I think,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.320]   things like this.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.520]   Have you been a good and faithful servant?
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.680]   Have you loved me with all your heart,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.440]   mind, soul, and strength?
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.680]   Have you loved others as I have loved you?
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.200]   Have you looked after the widows and the orphans?
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.600]   Have you been a voice of justice
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.240]   to the weak and the oppressed?
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.000]   All of which can be summed up in this question, I think.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.040]   Have you preached the word of God?
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.080]   Church, are we living in the light of Jesus's return?
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.960]   Do we live life knowing that it could
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.560]   truly be over at any moment?
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.320]   And because of this, do we realize
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   that there's a severe urgency in the way we live?
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.200]   Because of this, we have to preach the word.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.280]   Preach the word, be prepared in and out of season
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.520]   to correct, rebuke, encourage with great patience
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.440]   and careful instruction.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.880]   Preach the word, church.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.320]   Okay, I know, this is the preacher on a Sunday
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.880]   telling people to preach the word, right?
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.920]   This is your job, right?
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.320]   We pay you to do this, right?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.800]   This is what you're important for, Alison.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.640]   And yes, right, part of what we do on a Sunday
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.800]   is to preach the word.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.280]   And for me, on a personal level,
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.640]   I feel like this is something that God's called me to do,
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.840]   I enjoy doing, right?
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.400]   This is a part of my ministry.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.160]   However, the word preached does not mean
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.560]   the preaching, the teaching, unpacking of God's word
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:00.320]   at 11, 15, 12, and 9 or 15 on a Sunday, right?
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.880]   That's not what it means.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.000]   Preach simply means to proclaim or to talk about.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.800]   And when Paul says the word,
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.960]   it's not referring to just the actual words
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.360]   of scripture itself, but the word is really referring
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.560]   to the overall Christian message, right?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.040]   The message of truth and love and hope.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.640]   The message that King Jesus is the one
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.680]   who is the one true King, King of all kings.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.920]   He loved you enough to go to the cross for you
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.560]   as a sacrifice.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.000]   That is life, death, and resurrection means grace,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.520]   mercy, and forgiveness to all who will put their trust
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.360]   in him.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.920]   But here's the other thing as well.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.440]   Preaching is not just with words.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.280]   Part of preaching also has to be how we live our lives,
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.720]   right?
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.040]   Do we live a life that is in tune with Jesus?
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.360]   Like I was saying just now, do we love others like he does?
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.800]   Do we serve the poor and the marginalized?
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.360]   Are we living in the truth?
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.320]   Do we resist temptation and evil?
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.640]   We preach the word also when we live a life
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.280]   that reflects the life of Jesus.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.160]   So preaching the word means talking about
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.760]   and demonstrating the message of Jesus.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.960]   Now this is something everyone can do.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.400]   Not just the man behind the, not just the person,
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.320]   the man or woman behind the pulpit,
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.720]   but every single person.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.720]   And this challenge is one that we've got to,
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.040]   we have to live by all of the time.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.280]   In Paul's word he says, "In season and out of season."
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.240]   Now if you look through my Instagram algorithm,
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.320]   there's a lot of random stuff,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.200]   a lot of parenting tips, pranks you play on people,
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.960]   easy recipes, but also motivational things, right?
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.920]   There's a motivational guy, I'm not gonna call his name,
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.160]   he uses a lot of very colorful language.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.040]   Sometimes I listen to him to get myself
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.760]   to get ready to work out or something like that.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.600]   But if motivational quotes are your thing,
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.360]   you've probably heard some of these, right?
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.000]   Failure to prepare is what?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.640]   Preparation to fail.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.160]   Ooh, yeah.
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.840]   Stay ready so you don't have to get ready.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.200]   All those kind of things, right?
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.920]   Now, this is something that I've noticed.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.560]   We like to apply this mindset
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.400]   to certain aspects of our life, right?
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.960]   Stay on the grind.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.920]   Right, when it comes to things like working out
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.320]   or chasing your personal goal, reaching your dreams,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.760]   come on, yeah, no days off, let's get it,
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.760]   let's go, let's go, let's go, right?
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.760]   These are the kind of things
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.640]   that we like to motivate ourselves with.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.960]   But for some reason when it comes to preaching
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.480]   and living out the word, whew,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   suddenly we don't feel like we're ready.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.760]   Suddenly we're full of excuses.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.840]   Things like, oh, you know,
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   I don't really know the Bible well enough yet
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.800]   to go and talk to that person about it.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.640]   It's gonna be really awkward if I ask that person
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.560]   and if I can pray for them, right?
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.320]   Now, this person's gonna think I'm a weirdo
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.720]   if I ask them if they want to know who Jesus is.
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.240]   You know, I don't have much time right now.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.560]   I'm busy.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.760]   I'll serve the community next year.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.520]   It's not just a good time for me right now.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.080]   I'm gonna wait for a better occasion before I,
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.520]   you can fill in the blank.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.880]   But God's word here gives us no room for excuses.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.200]   And the truth is this,
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.640]   if we're always waiting for the right time,
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.560]   we'll always find a right reason to put it off.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.920]   This is what procrastination is.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.360]   Like, trust me, okay?
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.120]   Like my wife always says, don't you know,
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.360]   I always say to my wife, excuse me,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.080]   don't remind me every six months, okay?
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.680]   I'm gonna get round to fixing that cupboard
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.160]   in the wardrobe, okay?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.560]   Procrastination, I wrestle with it.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.400]   But here's the point.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.360]   If we only preach the gospel in times
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.600]   and conditions were right, it would never get done.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.920]   And the challenge here is this,
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.120]   whether the time seems right or not,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.760]   that's not what matters.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.960]   What matters is your readiness and your willingness
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.640]   to preach the word.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.040]   Paul is saying here, preaching the word
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.240]   isn't something that we clock in and out of,
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.960]   something that we can just complementalize
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.160]   as part of our lives, but this is something,
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.520]   if we want to stay on the grind for something,
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.080]   do it for the sake of preaching the gospel.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.600]   Now, I'll caveat with this.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.080]   At the same time, right, this doesn't constantly mean
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.280]   going round bashing people in the head with a Bible.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.280]   That's not what it's calling us to do here, though.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.560]   All right, don't get weird about it.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.400]   Maybe you know people like this too, right?
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.000]   You can't even have a normal conversation.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.280]   For someone like this, say,
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.560]   you ask them for a cup of water because you're thirsty,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.240]   and instead of just handing you a cup of water,
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.560]   they'll say something like,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.520]   oh, I know you're thirsty, brother,
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.720]   but do you know something else?
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.680]   You should be thirsty for the Lord, you know,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.360]   and you need the Holy Spirit in your life, right?
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.520]   Don't be that guy either, okay?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.160]   That's not what it's calling us to do.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.760]   The key here, okay, is to be prepared.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.320]   Be prepared so that when that moment comes,
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.480]   whenever that is, whether it's convenient or not,
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.400]   you are ready to preach the Word.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.960]   And we preach this Word, we believe in this Word,
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.880]   we live by this Word because the Word has power.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.840]   In other places, Paul would say that the Word
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.040]   is like a double-edged sword, dividing soul and spirit.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.760]   Early in the book of 2 Timothy,
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.960]   the Word is described as useful for teaching,
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.320]   rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.280]   In Romans, it tells us that faith comes
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.480]   from hearing the Word, and the Word is heard through,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.840]   and the message is heard through the Word about Christ.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.720]   Isaiah tells us that the only thing
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.320]   that's gonna last forever in this world is the Word of God.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.720]   And Paul here says the Word has the power.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.440]   It's got power to change people's lives.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.960]   It's got the power to correct, rebuke, and encourage.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.920]   Again, let's pause here to take a look at these words
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.480]   because they sound kind of serious,
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.640]   kind of scary, kind of judgmental.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.200]   But I think what Paul's trying to do here
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.160]   is explain how the power of God's Word
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.920]   has an immediate effect on our lives.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.200]   So the first word he says is to correct.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.060]   Correct means that the Word is able
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.920]   to guide us back onto the right path.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.960]   Scripture says the Word of the Lord is a lamp to my feet
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.280]   and a guide unto my path.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.280]   Now, this might make us a bit nervous
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.680]   because we live in a time and age
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.280]   where things don't really seem to have a right and a wrong.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.300]   Right, and when this is the case,
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.160]   then there isn't really anything to correct.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.660]   What's true for you might not be true for me,
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.580]   but that's okay, right?
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.280]   We'll just agree to disagree.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.480]   But the fact that God's Word can be used to correct
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.040]   means that there is a right way.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.640]   There is an objective truth
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.880]   that we can point people back towards.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.240]   There is a standard which God expects His people to live by.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   And God's Word is how we know what that is.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.680]   It's through God's Word that we know
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.940]   how He wants us to live.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.240]   It's through God's Word that we can always
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.640]   point our lives back when it seems to go off course.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.920]   His Word becomes like the north star in our life
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.460]   by which we navigate our life by.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.920]   So it's useful for correcting.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.760]   Now rebuking is the next word.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.640]   This word might make us even more nervous
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.120]   because it's not just about now
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.320]   pointing out something that is wrong.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.960]   It sounds like it's giving some kind of punishment.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.000]   But again, you know, the world might say, "How dare you?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   "Who do you think you are
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.160]   "to have the right to rebuke people?"
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.400]   But again, let me give you another way to look at it.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.080]   If we're the ones who know the Word, right,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.360]   and we believe the Word is the truth,
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.440]   if we're the ones that know the Word is the truth
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.760]   and it's the correct way to live,
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.120]   and we see people around us going down a path
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.160]   that is away from the Word,
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.120]   going in the wrong direction,
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.040]   in a direction that's going to lead to pain
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.900]   and destruction and death instead of life,
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.800]   and life in the full,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.400]   then you tell me what's the more loving thing to do.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.920]   To continue to let that person
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.620]   or those people go down that path?
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.960]   Or do everything you can to pull them back
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.280]   towards the truth, to rebuke and to correct,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.000]   to lead them back on the path that leads to Jesus?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.020]   Okay, but here's the key.
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.660]   And this is very important as well,
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.120]   because often this is the part I think we get wrong.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.160]   Because when our methods of correcting and rebuking
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.680]   are not done in the right way,
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.880]   it can actually be really damaging
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.240]   and leads to hurting people.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.020]   It leads to Christians being labeled
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.600]   and sometimes justifiably as being mean
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.380]   and arrogant, judgmental, hypocritical.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.060]   So when we talk about correcting and rebuking,
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.280]   it has to be done in the right way.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.420]   Which is why Paul adds at the end of this,
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.720]   the right way to do this is through encouragement.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.900]   To encourage means to urge,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.600]   to come alongside, to support,
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.260]   not to bash over the head, okay?
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.780]   That's not encouraging.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.300]   And with encouragement, it's also done
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.860]   with great patience and careful instruction.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.820]   You see, we just correct and rebuke
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.000]   without patience and grace,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.580]   that does not reflect the heart of God.
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:44.380]   And we come off as jerks and bad and hypocritical.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.340]   Actually, when we do this,
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.780]   we don't just dishonor the name of yourself,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.400]   but it also dishonors the name of Jesus.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.180]   It makes him seem like a bad guy who's not caring,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.820]   who's not patient, who's not full of grace and mercy.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.340]   We have to understand that it's a journey
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.280]   to learn how to live according to the word,
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.220]   just like it's been a journey for you.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.400]   And we can't expect people to get it right straight away.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.580]   And when we rebuke without careful instruction,
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.900]   it leaves people feeling confused and frustrated.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.620]   It's like telling somebody that they're wrong,
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.380]   but never explaining why.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.940]   And when we correct without patience,
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.260]   it leaves people feeling frustrated and uncared for,
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.620]   like there's some sort of project
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.860]   that we've been sent to fix
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.420]   just to take that off our list.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.020]   So it has to be done with love, with grace,
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.580]   with mercy, with great patience and encouragement.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.780]   And then Paul wants us to understand this,
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.120]   scripture wants us to understand this,
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.180]   it's not going to be easy.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.280]   Preaching and living out the word
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.020]   is going to come with a whole lot of pushback,
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.580]   resistance and even rebellion.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.860]   He says it like this, "For the time will come
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.540]   when people will not put up with sound doctrine.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.320]   Instead, to suit their own desires,
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.620]   they will gather around them a great number of teachers
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.460]   to say what the itching ears want to hear.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.140]   They will turn away from the truth and turn aside to myths."
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.620]   Right, in other words, there is a time coming
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.620]   when people will not like the word that we're gonna bring.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.920]   Right, they're not gonna like the word
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.360]   that is gonna keep them close to God.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.500]   They're not gonna like the word
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.360]   that will help them be more like Jesus.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.540]   They're not gonna like teaching
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.500]   that's gonna keep them strong in the Lord.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.840]   They're not gonna like it
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.240]   when they're corrected and rebuked
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.760]   because in their minds, they've already made up,
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.080]   you know, the decision of what is right and what is wrong.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.920]   So instead of listening to the truth,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.340]   instead of listening to what is good,
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.080]   they will simply find people to tell them
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.640]   whatever it is they want to hear,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.620]   to tickle their ears,
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.780]   to make them feel better about themselves,
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.320]   thinking they can just rest easy,
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.920]   ignoring the fact that like we said at the beginning,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.200]   Jesus is coming back to judge.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.860]   And one day, we're gonna have to give an account
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.720]   of how we've lived to him.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.380]   This isn't a prophetic warning over the church.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.600]   Now, let's look at it this way, okay?
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.780]   Suppose you go for a checkup with your doctor
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.660]   and the doctor tells you, "You know what?
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.500]   "Cholesterol's looking kind of high.
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   "Sugar level's kind of high.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.020]   "Your heart's struggling a bit.
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.920]   "Maybe lay off the sugary foods, you know,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.700]   "do more exercise, drink more water, sleep earlier.
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.260]   "Make a few changes because you're not healthy, right?"
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.660]   Oh, okay, not my recent checkup, I hope, okay?
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.060]   But imagine you went to the doctor and they told you that.
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.580]   Oh, but you don't want to do that, right?
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.980]   You want donuts for life.
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.880]   You say, "I'm not here for a long time.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.580]   "I'm here for a good time, right?
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.960]   "I don't want to be skinny and healthy.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.220]   "I want to be fat and happy," right?
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.180]   And so you keep finding doctors.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.260]   You keep finding doctors until you one find that says,
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.540]   "Oh, yeah, you know, whatever, yeah, it's high,
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.440]   "but it's not like really high."
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.500]   And actually, you know what?
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.100]   Donuts actually have a lot of nutrients in them, right?
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.540]   So like, donuts aren't the worst, okay?
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.340]   So in fact, you know what?
[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.220]   I've read a recent report that sweat's not good for you.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.740]   It clogs up your pores, right?
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.580]   And so, and you know, too much water isn't bad.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.320]   You need some electrolytes in your life as well.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.380]   So you know, like fizzy drinks, that's also fine, right?
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.280]   This is the kind of thinking that the church
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.840]   is in danger of, right?
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.640]   The trend that people just wanting to hear
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.760]   whatever they want to hear.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.160]   The trend of people being told, "You're fine.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.020]   "Don't change.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.600]   "You don't need to discipline yourself.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.780]   "You don't need to believe everything that Jesus says.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.240]   "You do you, and it's all good."
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.000]   Listen, if you want to have your ears tickled,
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.240]   there are gonna be people out there
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.880]   who will tickle your ears in all sorts of ways.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.560]   People like, not gonna go there, okay?
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.440]   But there will be people, okay, that will lie to you,
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.480]   okay, and say things like, "Jesus promised you prosperity.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.920]   "You just gotta name it and claim it,
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.360]   "and then it's yours," right?
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.340]   That's what Jesus says, right?
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.720]   They will take a verse like Psalm 37, four.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.600]   Look, it says right here in the Bible,
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.000]   "God will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.320]   So you're just gonna pray to God,
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.920]   and he's gonna give you everything you want, right?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.960]   They will twist and turn and corrupt the word of God
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.980]   so that people can feel as though they're following him
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.120]   without any cost, without any discipline,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.040]   without any sacrifice in their lives.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.480]   All this to say, if we're gonna commit
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   to preaching the word, make sure we're preaching the word,
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.800]   not some watered-down, weakened,
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.680]   fluffy, ear-tickling version of it.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.920]   And we have to watch out for this
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.020]   because this version is not the gospel.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.200]   It might be what people want to hear,
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.340]   but it's not gonna be what they need.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.760]   This version of the word will strip it from its power.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.960]   This version of the word will carry no ability
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.840]   to set people free, to bring real hope, real life,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.200]   real salvation to a world out there
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.380]   that's lost and suffering.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:11.520]   Woe to me if I don't preach the gospel.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.700]   If we are truly committed to preaching the word,
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.520]   this church, brothers and sisters,
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.780]   is what we're gonna have to put up with.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.160]   Which is why Paul points us with this final encouragement.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.960]   But you, keep your head.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:35.320]   In all situations, endure hardship,
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.320]   do the work of an evangelist,
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   discharge all the duties of your ministry.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.740]   In other words, Paul is saying,
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.200]   if you're finding this difficult to do,
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.640]   if it's a challenge, if it's hard,
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.860]   if you're coming against pushback,
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.000]   then you're probably doing the right thing.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.600]   We are called to be different.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.760]   We have been called to stand firm.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.960]   We have been called not to turn to this and that,
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.240]   but rather, as it says here,
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.600]   keep your head in all situations.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.740]   Don't be enticed by these false teachings,
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.280]   but focus on what you know is true.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.940]   Endure hardship.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.460]   As we do this, we know it's not going to be easy.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.100]   Like we saw with the people we studied,
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.920]   it's gonna be difficult and painful at times,
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.140]   but let me ask you this, church,
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.800]   did you start following Jesus in order to have an easy life?
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.540]   I hope not.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.180]   I hope your decision to follow Jesus
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.820]   was because you came to realize that he is the true king.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.900]   You came to follow Jesus because you realized
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.060]   he is the only way, the truth, and the life.
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.920]   So we go on announcing Jesus is Lord.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.960]   And no matter what happens, what's required is not success
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.500]   as the world sees success,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.780]   but rather loyalty and perseverance to preaching his word.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:59.740]   This is why the task, therefore, is to preach the word,
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.540]   do the work of the evangelist,
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.300]   an evangelist, the one that preaches and lives out
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.900]   and speaks the word of God.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:12.180]   Never stop proclaiming the gospel in everything that you do.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.040]   There is work to be done.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.500]   And like I said, time is short.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.620]   And now that we've encountered God, we know him,
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.760]   we come together each and every Sunday and we encounter him,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.640]   now it's on us to preach the word.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.780]   You may have classmates or schoolmates
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.180]   who have not yet heard the gospel.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.640]   There may be family out there
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.000]   who are still to discover who Jesus is.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.720]   You have colleagues who are lost and wondering,
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.480]   where is the purpose and direction of my life?
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.280]   There's an opportunity there to point them towards Jesus.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.240]   We have a city, 90-something percent of our city in Hong Kong
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.460]   still don't really know who Jesus is.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.280]   And look around us, church.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.160]   Each week we have more than 1,000 people,
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.040]   that's a lot of people, coming into this building.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.260]   We worship, we connect, we encourage, we love, we care,
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.640]   we give, we do all these things within the building
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.040]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.360]   And I love this church, I love the community,
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.240]   I love being part of the team here,
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.040]   but I'm fully convinced also
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.820]   that this is not all it's meant to be.
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.360]   And at the end of every Sunday, I always think to myself,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.800]   what if, what if every single person here
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.920]   committed to preaching the word outside of this space?
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.660]   What if every single person here
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.080]   committed to help people around them
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.300]   to come to a faith in Jesus through encouragement,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:52.180]   through love, through patience, no matter how hard it gets?
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:56.720]   This is the key, this is how the world is changed.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:00.480]   Look, it started from 12 disciples following Jesus
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.520]   to the billions of Christians
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.920]   that we see worshiping Jesus today.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.360]   And that mission, that call continues for us
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.500]   to go and continue to preach the word.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:15.100]   This is how we truly fulfill our purpose
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.140]   of lifting up the name of Jesus.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   So church, I challenge us, I challenge you and myself,
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.480]   preach the word in and out of season.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.940]   Carry out your giftings, use them for the glory of God,
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.320]   to show the people around you who God truly is.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.100]   This is what we've been called to do as a body of Christ.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.100]   If you would close your eyes for a minute,
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.060]   I'm gonna pray for us, I'm gonna give us some guidance
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.420]   around what now to do next.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.840]   (soft music)
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:06.300]   As we've been listening and thinking,
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.260]   and maybe the Holy Spirit's already been speaking to you
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.200]   about a name, someone that you need to go and talk to,
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.520]   a task that he's entrusted you to do.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.360]   (soft music)
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.040]   A challenge, something that you've put off for a while,
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.240]   but now the Lord is reminding you of it.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.200]   Or maybe even a new, a fresh word,
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.600]   something that he's revealed to you
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.060]   in the course of the past 30 minutes or so.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:42.620]   Whatever it is, this is something that literally,
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.560]   every single person in this room,
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.580]   without excuse, can respond to.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.920]   And that there's a task for everyone to do.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   There is a person, there's a situation,
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.520]   there's something that you can preach the word of God to
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.280]   in your own context, in where God has placed you.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:10.320]   And so Jesus, I pray that you would reveal those things
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.140]   to us.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.600]   We thank you for this, Lord.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.840]   We thank you that you love the world so much,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.600]   and not just the people who are within your church already,
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   but our call, Lord, is to make disciples,
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.960]   to baptize, to glorify your name, to make it known,
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.960]   to tell people out there who need salvation,
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.600]   that time is short,
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.480]   that life on this earth is precious and fleeting,
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.640]   and that Jesus will come back one day.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.720]   So Lord, give us no rest until everyone
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.240]   is calling out your name.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.920]   And help us, Lord, use us for the job of preaching your word,
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.520]   for the job of, for the task of, for the purpose of
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.240]   letting people around you, letting people around us
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:07.600]   know who you are, and how great and how glorious you are,
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.640]   but also how loving and kind you are.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.040]   Use this church for this purpose, Lord.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:23.920]   And family, if you would like to respond to this,
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.520]   I just ask you to simply stand up and say,
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.160]   I'm gonna do this, Lord.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.800]   I'm not sure why or how or what it means exactly yet,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.040]   but I'm gonna trust in you, Jesus.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.520]   And I'm willing, Lord, to preach the word,
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.640]   to make disciples, to let people around me know about you.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.160]   If you're willing to respond to that, church,
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.720]   I invite you to stand and worship together
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.000]   with your brothers and sisters around you
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   to encourage each other in this journey.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.760]   May God lead us and guide us and have mercy on us.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.480]   We do this all in the name of Jesus Christ, our Savior.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.320]   Amen.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
