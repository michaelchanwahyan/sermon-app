00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 >>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Welcome everyone and welcome to everyone

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,540
 joining us online.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,780
 Some weeks ago

5
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,780
 one of my daughters, my son and I

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,820
 were returning home.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,820
 As we came up to our apartment building

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,860
 you have to scan

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,220
 your Octopus card to get in.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,200
 It is specially linked.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,160
 In previous years

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,900
 if you were a family unit and you were coming in

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,500
 you had to zap your card

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 and you could all enter.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,980
 Lately they have gotten really strict

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,540
 and they have been wanting everyone

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,340
 to touch their card as they come in.

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,080
 As we came up to the doorway

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,420
 my son and daughter were in front of me.

20
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,420
 I was behind them

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,580
 and I had my earphones in and I was watching

22
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,620
 on my phone

23
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,560
 one of the loves of my life, rugby.

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
 I was completely immersed

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,560
 in this game

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,200
 and my two children were in front of me

27
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
 and they both went and zapped their cards

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,140
 and I just followed in behind them.

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,040
 I did not zap my card.

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
 The elderly security guard

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,080
 saw me and he pointed at the machine

32
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,980
 like you need to zap your card.

33
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,740
 I ignored him

34
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,780
 and kept walking

35
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,280
 and I pointed to my son and daughter like I am

36
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,520
 with them.

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,060
 I must have made a noise

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,140
 and it must have been

39
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,080
 a little bit loud

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,640
 because my son immediately turned around

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,040
 to me and he said

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,080
 that was really rude.

43
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,160
 When Andrew

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,860
 asked me to speak on this message

45
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,320
 of living a life worthy of the calling of God

46
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
 and I am somebody

47
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,020
 that is still being held accountable

48
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,400
 in the way I walk and live by my son

49
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,160
 I was like

50
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,060
 writing back to Andrew

51
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,600
 going I will do this but you need to know

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,340
 that this is very much something

53
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,840
 that I am wrestling with

54
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,600
 and I am a work in progress.

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,140
 He replied back to me

56
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,280
 and said yes,

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,340
 that is the honesty

58
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,340
 that we need.

59
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,940
 Today I will be sharing with you

60
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,020
 some things

61
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,680
 that are at work within me

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,880
 and I hope that they will be an encouragement

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,980
 to you as well.

64
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
 Let's read Ephesians 4

65
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,020
 verses 1-10

66
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,560
 as a prisoner for the Lord

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,320
 I urge you to live a life

68
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,520
 worthy of the calling

69
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,460
 you have received.

70
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,620
 Be completely humble and gentle

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,700
 and be patient

72
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,260
 and bearing with one another in love.

73
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,560
 Make every effort to keep the unity of the

74
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,240
 spirit through the bond of peace.

75
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
 There is one body and one spirit

76
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,680
 just as you were called

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,880
 to one hope

78
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 when you were called.

79
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,520
 One Lord, one faith, one baptism

80
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,440
 one God and father of all

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
 who is overall

82
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,480
 and through all

83
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 and in all.

84
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,060
 But to each one of us,

85
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,120
 grace has been given

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 as Christ apportioned it.

87
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,320
 This is why it says

88
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,660
 when he ascended on high

89
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,720
 he took many captives

90
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,760
 and gave gifts

91
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 to his children.

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,960
 What does he ascended mean

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
 except that he also descended

94
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,000
 to the lower earthly regions?

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,040
 He who descended

96
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,140
 is the very one

97
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,160
 who ascended

98
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,640
 higher than all the heavens

99
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,740
 in order to fill

100
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,740
 the whole universe.

101
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,280
 I would like to focus first

102
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
 on Ephesians 4 verse 1

103
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,580
 as a prisoner for the Lord

104
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,440
 then I urge you

105
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,020
 to live a life worthy

106
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
 of the calling

107
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,020
 you have received.

108
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,280
 The new King James Version

109
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
 says I therefore

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,680
 the prisoner of the Lord

111
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
 beseech you

112
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,740
 to walk worthy

113
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,780
 of the calling

114
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,820
 with which you are called.

115
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,840
 What word or words

116
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,880
 do you focus on

117
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,920
 when you hear

118
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,960
 these verses?

119
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,980
 My eyes get drawn

120
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,020
 to the word worthy.

121
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,060
 Walk worthy, live worthy.

122
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,100
 And lately I found myself

123
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
 measuring myself

124
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
 and asking myself

125
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,140
 am I living a life

126
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,140
 worthy of the calling

127
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,160
 I have received?

128
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,200
 Am I living a life

129
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 worthy of the calling

130
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
 I have received?

131
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,660
 And I'm asking myself

132
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,700
 am I living a life

133
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,720
 that is worthy enough?

134
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
 At times I've felt guilty

135
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,800
 because I feel like

136
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,840
 I've not been doing enough.

137
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,860
 That there are expectations

138
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,900
 I'm not fulfilling.

139
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,940
 I've wrestled with

140
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,980
 whether my life

141
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,000
 is turning out

142
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,040
 the way

143
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,080
 God intended it to.

144
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,120
 I wonder if there's

145
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,140
 anyone here this morning

146
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,180
 that's asked

147
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,220
 a similar question.

148
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,240
 Is my life

149
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
 turning out

150
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,320
 the way

151
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
 I intended it to?

152
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,380
 Recently on one of my

153
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,400
 bus commutes to school

154
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,420
 and as you know

155
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,440
 if you've heard me

156
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,480
 preach before

157
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,500
 there's always something

158
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,540
 from my bus commutes

159
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,580
 to school.

160
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,600
 I felt God

161
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,620
 shift my focus

162
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,640
 in the verse

163
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,660
 away from the word

164
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,680
 worthy

165
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,720
 to the words

166
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,740
 walk and live.

167
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,760
 God reminded me

168
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,780
 in a profound way

169
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,800
 that our worthiness

170
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,820
 has nothing to do

171
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,860
 with us.

172
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,880
 We cannot do

173
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,900
 anything

174
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
 to walk

175
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,940
 more worthy

176
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,960
 or live

177
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,980
 more worthy.

178
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,000
 We have

179
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,020
 been made

180
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,040
 worthy

181
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,060
 through an

182
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,080
 act of

183
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,100
 grace.

184
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,120
 An undeserved

185
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,140
 lavish

186
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,160
 gift

187
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
 of love.

188
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,220
 I'll say it

189
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,240
 again,

190
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,260
 our worthiness

191
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,300
 has nothing

192
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,320
 to do

193
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,340
 with us.

194
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,360
 It has

195
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,400
 everything to do

196
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,420
 with a precious

197
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,440
 gift of a

198
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,460
 son

199
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,480
 whose perfection

200
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,500
 and goodness

201
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
 covers us

202
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,560
 as we walk

203
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,580
 out

204
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,600
 our

205
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,620
 sanctification

206
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,640
 journey.

207
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,680
 Paul spends

208
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,700
 the first

209
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,740
 half

210
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,780
 of his

211
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,800
 letter

212
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,820
 going into

213
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,840
 extravagant

214
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
 detail

215
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
 of the

216
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,940
 wondrous

217
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,980
 things God

218
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,020
 has done

219
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,040
 for us.

220
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,080
 He chose

221
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,120
 us.

222
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,160
 In love

223
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,180
 he adopted

224
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,220
 us.

225
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,260
 All of this

226
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,280
 freely given

227
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,320
 by God's

228
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,360
 extravagant

229
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,400
 grace.

230
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
 Our eyes

231
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,460
 might be

232
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,500
 drawn to

233
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,520
 this word

234
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,560
 worthy and

235
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,600
 for some

236
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,640
 of us it

237
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,660
 may have

238
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,700
 made you

239
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,740
 feel

240
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,760
 disqualified.

241
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,800
 But this is

242
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,840
 not what

243
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,880
 this verse

244
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,900
 is about.

245
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
 It is not

246
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,940
 what Paul

247
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
 was trying

248
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,980
 to convey.

249
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,020
 Commentators

250
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
 believe that

251
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,040
 Paul was

252
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 under house

253
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
 arrest in

254
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
 Rome when

255
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
 he wrote

256
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,180
 this letter.

257
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,220
 He was

258
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,260
 unable to

259
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
 use their

260
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,320
 freedom

261
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,360
 to walk

262
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,400
 and live

263
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,420
 worthy of

264
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,460
 the calling

265
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,500
 they had

266
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,520
 received.

267
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,560
 To walk and

268
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
 live in the

269
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,640
 calling of

270
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,660
 God has

271
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,700
 nothing to

272
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,740
 do with

273
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,760
 our worthiness.

274
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,780
 The calling

275
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,800
 is worthy.

276
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
 Our primary

277
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,840
 calling is to

278
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,880
 be in a

279
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,900
 personal

280
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,940
 relationship with

281
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,980
 God.

282
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,020
 To be a

283
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
 son or

284
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,040
 a daughter

285
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,080
 of God.

286
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
 If we

287
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,160
 have received

288
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
 this

289
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,220
 calling,

290
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,260
 we have

291
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,280
 been made

292
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,320
 worthy.

293
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,360
 So Paul's

294
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,400
 focus was not

295
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,420
 to call the

296
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,460
 people to

297
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,500
 worthiness.

298
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 This had

299
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,520
 already been

300
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,560
 achieved by

301
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,600
 them receiving

302
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,640
 and responding

303
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,660
 to God's

304
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,700
 call to be

305
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,740
 in relationship

306
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,780
 with him.

307
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,780
 Paul was

308
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,800
 urging them,

309
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,840
 beseeching

310
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,880
 them.

311
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,900
 This word

312
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,940
 means to

313
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:38,980
 ask someone

314
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,020
 urgently or

315
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,040
 fervently to

316
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,080
 do something.

317
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
 He was

318
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,140
 imploring

319
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,180
 them to

320
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
 walk in

321
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,220
 it, live

322
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,260
 it out,

323
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,280
 do something

324
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,320
 with it.

325
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,360
 Under house

326
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
 arrest, Paul

327
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,400
 was well

328
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,420
 aware that

329
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,460
 his ability

330
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,500
 to walk and

331
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,600
 live out his

332
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 calling had

333
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,640
 been somewhat

334
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
 limited.

335
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,440
 His imprisonment

336
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,360
 had opened

337
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,500
 his eyes to

338
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,440
 how necessary

339
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
 it was to

340
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,540
 live out his

341
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,580
 calling.

342
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,600
 He was

343
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
 imploring them

344
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,680
 to walk in

345
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
 it, live

346
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
 it out, do

347
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,840
 something with

348
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
 it.

349
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
 How necessary

350
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,880
 it was that

351
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,920
 God's people

352
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,940
 did not waste

353
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,980
 their freedom,

354
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,720
 their opportunity

355
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,760
 to do something

356
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,780
 with this

357
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,820
 incredible gift,

358
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,860
 this incredible

359
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,880
 calling they

360
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,920
 had received.

361
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,960
 So in

362
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,000
 summation of

363
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 this first

364
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,020
 verse, the

365
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,060
 calling is

366
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,100
 worthy.

367
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,100
 The calling is

368
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,140
 worthy of our

369
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,160
 attention.

370
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,200
 You do not

371
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
 have to be

372
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,280
 worthy.

373
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,300
 In fact, you

374
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,340
 cannot ever

375
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
 be worthy of

376
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,400
 the calling of

377
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
 God.

378
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
 You cannot

379
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
 be worthy of

380
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,520
 the calling of

381
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,540
 God.

382
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
 You cannot

383
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,580
 be worthy of

384
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,620
 the calling of

385
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,620
 God.

386
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,620
 You cannot

387
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,660
 be worthy of

388
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,660
 the calling of

389
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
 God.

390
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
 You cannot

391
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
 be worthy of

392
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
 the calling of

393
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,660
 God.

394
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,700
 You cannot

395
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,720
 be worthy of

396
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,760
 the calling of

397
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
 God.

398
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
 You cannot

399
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,800
 be worthy of

400
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,840
 the calling of

401
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
 God.

402
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
 You cannot

403
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
 be worthy of

404
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
 the calling of

405
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,900
 God.

406
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,940
 You cannot

407
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,980
