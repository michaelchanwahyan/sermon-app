1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 Amen.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,640
 Thank you worship team for leading us.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,800
 That was beautiful.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,640
 Thank you church.

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,080
 You guys can have a seat.

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,200
 Get yourselves comfortable.

7
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,160
 Good afternoon, my name's Ellison.

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,120
 It's an honor to be sharing God's word with you today.

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,880
 And yeah, the sun's shining,

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
 so everybody got here nice and dry.

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,120
 That's really good.

12
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,460
 Glad to be here.

13
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,240
 Well I'm not sure if you've noticed

14
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,200
 in the songs that we sing,

15
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,960
 in the popular songs that we sing,

16
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,320
 there is this sentiment, right?

17
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,440
 For some reason, there's this idea out there

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,440
 that to go a long distance for the one you love

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,640
 is really, really romantic.

20
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,360
 Okay, it's something really beautifully romantic about that.

21
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,960
 As the saying goes,

22
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,280
 distance makes the heart grow fonder, right?

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,920
 Technically, I guess what that means

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,880
 is the further you are apart,

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,120
 the more romantic it is, right?

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,680
 So I can testify to this a little bit.

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,720
 There was a period for about nine months, right,

28
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,080
 when Brittany and I were dating long distance,

29
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,200
 nine, 10 months.

30
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,840
 I was here in Hong Kong, she was back in Texas.

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,360
 And I have the receipts, okay?

32
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,400
 I'm not lying, okay?

33
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,420
 And she's sitting right there, so you can ask her.

34
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,780
 For nine months, every single day,

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,880
 I wrote a handwritten letter,

36
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,720
 put it in the mail, and sent it over to Texas, right?

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,940
 Sometimes it'd just be one word,

38
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,640
 like hello, or whatever, right?

39
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,320
 Sometimes it'd be like a little doodle I did during the day.

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,100
 But pretty much every single day,

41
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,840
 I would send a letter by mail to Brittany, right?

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,440
 And it was a good thing, right?

43
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,120
 Yeah, we still have those letters.

44
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,420
 If you ever wanna come over for dinner, I'll show you, okay?

45
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,200
 But there's that idea out there.

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,120
 We sing about it, there's popular songs about it.

47
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,960
 This is kinda old now, I'm dating myself.

48
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,720
 But do you remember the soundtrack

49
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,840
 for the first Space Jam movie,

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,600
 the original Space Jam movie with Michael Jordan, right?

51
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
 There was a song there called "For You I Will"

52
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,840
 by a pop star called Monica, right?

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,240
 And the lyrics go like this,

54
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,680
 I would cross the ocean for you.

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,120
 I would go and bring you the moon, all right?

56
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,240
 I would be your hero, your strength, anything you need.

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
 Right, a song that's made popular again,

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,680
 or actually I don't think it's ever been not popular,

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,700
 the Proclaimers, right?

60
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,780
 It's really famous, right?

61
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,780
 I would walk 500 miles, and I would walk 500 more, right?

62
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,000
 To be the man who walks 1,000 miles,

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,080
 1,000 miles to end up at your door.

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
 Right, Vanessa Carlton, you know, the do-do-do-do-do-do,

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,400
 you know, she also walks 1,000 miles, right?

66
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,360
 To just be with the person that she loves.

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,080
 Tonight, right, that's how she thinks.

68
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
 But it's kinda silly, right,

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
 when you think about these things.

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
 Because, okay, I'm sorry, Monica,

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
 but you are an R&B pop star, you're not an astronaut,

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,640
 you're not a nautical expert, okay?

73
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,200
 Do you know how even the smallest ocean

74
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,200
 is 14,000, 140,000 square kilometers wide?

75
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,120
 The moon is more than 380,000 kilometers away from Earth.

76
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,640
 I'm not sure she's capable of going to the moon and back.

77
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,920
 The average walking pace of someone,

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,160
 unless you're Carla Roscoe, who walks like lightning speed,

79
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,120
 is about three to four miles per hour.

80
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,680
 If you were to walk 1,000 miles without taking any breaks,

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,880
 the song should really go,

82
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,360
 I would walk 1,000 miles to see you in about two weeks.

83
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,800
 Not tonight, right?

84
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,480
 So, it's ridiculous, right?

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,240
 These things are just hyperboles,

86
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,000
 these things are just imagination, right?

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 It's romanticized way of expressing our love for someone.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,800
 But what would you be willing to do?

89
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,640
 Like, how far would you be willing to go

90
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,160
 for the one you love?

91
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,700
 These days, if you ask me,

92
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,460
 my distance and romance is a bit more limited, right?

93
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,600
 I get annoyed these days when after I sit down

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,960
 and Brittany goes, can you go and get me a glass of water?

95
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,640
 I'm like, all the way to the kitchen and back?

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,680
 Like, really?

97
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,120
 Like, I don't really have the energy for that, right?

98
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,200
 So, maybe I could do with being a bit more romantic

99
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,880
 these days as well.

100
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,240
 But we like the idea of this, right?

101
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,040
 We like the idea of someone doing something

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,120
 spectacular for us, of someone going all the lengths

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,460
 to the end of the world and back.

104
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,240
 It's romantic, it's good, but no one actually expects

105
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,480
 their loved ones to do these kind of things for them,

106
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,320
 do they?

107
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,600
 But here's the thing, and as cheesy as this sounds,

108
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,200
 I have to tell you, somebody has.

109
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
 All right, this is one of the key points

110
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,400
 we like to emphasize when it comes to the Christian faith.

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,480
 We have a savior who left his home in heaven,

112
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,860
 came down to earth, took on sin and darkness

113
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,620
 and shame and evil and injustice and all this other way

114
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,960
 the world's been messed up, died the death

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,920
 that was meant for us just because he loved us

116
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,000
 and he wanted to be near to us.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,520
 And so in this process, we've been brought near to Jesus,

118
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,800
 he has also made us new.

119
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,480
 And we have been made new to carry out the many

120
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,020
 wonderful things that he has prepared for his children

121
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,360
 to do.

122
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,900
 This was a beautiful reminder, this was the message

123
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,040
 that Pastor Andrew said to us last week.

124
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,880
 But this is just the starting point.

125
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,360
 And if we want to know his love, his grace,

126
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,000
 his mercy and forgiveness, if we want to know

127
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,240
 the nearness of Christ, then there is a part

128
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,120
 for us to play as well, as his children,

129
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,560
 as his church, as his people.

130
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,040
 Being close to Jesus isn't just about soaking it all in

131
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,200
 and being in that space, but there's a challenge

132
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,960
 for us too, when we receive his love,

133
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,360
 there is something we have to do with it.

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
 And so we come to a point in our journey

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,920
 through the book of Ephesians, because like we said,

136
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
 yes, we've been blessed by God.

137
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,440
 Yes, our hope is in Christ.

138
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,260
 Yes, we have this resurrection power at work within us.

139
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,020
 We've been raised to life by God, but there's one reminder.

140
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,800
 God didn't do it just for you, the individual.

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,640
 He did it for everybody.

142
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,760
 And so if he did it for everybody, it means everybody

143
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,600
 is being brought near to Christ, which means

144
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,760
 there has to be unity as we're being brought together

145
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,120
 as one body.

146
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,360
 The question is, how?

147
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,160
 How do we have this unity in Christ?

148
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
 And the passage we're looking at today

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
 is gonna tell us a little bit about that.

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
 So I'm gonna read it, and we're gonna go through it

151
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
 and see what God has to say to us.

152
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,000
 Ephesians chapter two, verses 11 to 22.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,800
 It says this.

154
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
 Therefore, remember that formerly you who were Gentiles

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
 by birth and called uncircumcised by those

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
 who call themselves the circumcision,

157
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
 which is done in the body by human hands.

158
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,240
 Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ,

159
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,560
 excluded from citizenship in heaven,

160
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,040
 and foreigners to the covenants of the promise,

161
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,840
 without hope and without God in the world.

162
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,080
 But now in Christ Jesus, you who were once far away

163
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,900
 have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

164
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,420
 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one

165
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,640
 and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility

166
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,720
 by setting aside in his flesh the law

167
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,400
 with his commandments and regulations.

168
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,480
 His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity

169
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,280
 out of the two, thus making peace.

170
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,240
 And in one body to reconcile both of them to God

171
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,600
 through the cross by which he put to death their hostility.

172
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,240
 He came and preached peace to you who were far away

173
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,820
 and preached to those who were near.

174
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,920
 For through him we have both access

175
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,640
 to the Father by one spirit.

176
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,720
 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers,

177
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,160
 but fellow citizens with God's people,

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,440
 and also members of his household,

179
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,060
 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets

180
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,480
 with Jesus Christ himself as the chief cornerstone.

181
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,320
 In him the whole building is joined together

182
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,440
 and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.

183
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,200
 And in him you too are being built together

184
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,160
 to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.

185
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,040
 So let's go back to Paul.

186
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,640
 Let's go back to this time in Ephesus.

187
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,000
 As we know, it's not an easy situation

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,520
 that Paul is speaking to when this letter that he wrote

189
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,040
 reached the people of Ephesus.

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,760
 Apart from the culture of the pantheon of gods

191
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,840
 that different people worshipped,

192
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,000
 there was also the very open and hostile division

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,920
 between Jews and Gentiles.

194
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,360
 The Jewish people stood firm on their faith

195
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,680
 in the part of God's history as his chosen people.

196
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,160
 And there were a few things that marked them out as such.

197
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,840
 And circumcision was one of these main things.

198
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,800
 That's the main emphasis of what Paul's trying to say here.

199
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,740
 Now the act of circumcision itself, of course,

200
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,700
 is rooted in their history.

201
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,680
 Given to Abraham by God, Genesis 17,

202
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,780
 the point of circumcision was a physical sign

203
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,320
 of the covenant that God had given his people.

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,460
 It was like a physical marking of you are separated

205
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,600
 to be a part of God's people.

206
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,380
 And so therefore circumcision became one of those things

207
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,360
 that was used against non-Jews to keep them separate.

208
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,160
 If a Gentile man wanted to enter into the community of God,

209
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,040
 the people of God, it was expected

210
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,400
 that he would have to be circumcised.

211
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,320
 This was the established mindset at the time.

212
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,080
 Which is why the point Paul is making here

213
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,960
 sounds actually really, really shocking.

214
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,560
 It would have sounded really shocking.

215
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,040
 Because Paul makes it obvious to the readers,

216
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,720
 to the hearers, to the listeners.

217
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,920
 It's obvious that circumcision, he says,

218
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,860
 no longer carries the importance that it used to.

219
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,200
 And one of the reasons he's saying that

220
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,380
 is because now it's actually being used to exclude people

221
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,560
 from entering into the community

222
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
 that God has called them to be.

223
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,680
 Right, Galatians 5, 6, Paul says this in a different way.

224
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,720
 For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision

225
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,600
 nor non-circumcision has any value.

226
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,660
 And why is this?

227
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,440
 Because Paul tells us circumcision is something

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,120
 that is done in the body by human hands.

229
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,440
 Now when Paul says by human hands,

230
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,980
 that's also significant here.

231
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,440
 Because against the backdrop of the idol worship of Ephesus,

232
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,920
 using the phrase by human hands,

233
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,140
 that's the same phrase that people would use

234
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,500
 to describe the idols that were being made

235
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,060
 by the people in Ephesus at the time.

236
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,080
 Those too were made by human hands.

237
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,280
 Right, lifeless, powerless objects.

238
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,120
 Not made by God, not designed by God,

239
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,000
 but only by humans, by their hands.

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,340
 And so therefore, by talking about circumcision

241
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,920
 in the same way, you would say that Paul's talking,

242
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,760
 this is circumcision, it's just like these idols.

243
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
 It's become a little bit irrelevant, right?

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,280
 It's got no power, it's no longer a critical part

245
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,720
 of your identity as God's chosen people.

246
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,040
 Now, what has this got to do with us?

247
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,720
 I just said circumcision 13 times, okay,

248
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,420
 in the past two minutes.

249
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,660
 What does this have to do with us?

250
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,920
 Well, let me ask you this way.

251
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,400
 What practices do we currently hold

252
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,940
 to keep people out of community with us?

253
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,680
 But yet, actually, this is something that's worthless

254
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,040
 in the eyes of God.

255
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,880
 We might not have something as physical,

256
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,240
 as outward as circumcision,

257
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,360
 so it might not be as obvious to us,

258
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,720
 but it's something we got to be asking ourselves,

259
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,080
 because if there are such barriers,

260
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,800
 then we need to name them for what they are,

261
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
 and name them for the worthless things they are,

262
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,440
 because they have no place in the community of God.

263
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,320
 Because as we're about to find out,

264
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,120
 there ought to be no barriers for those

265
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 who want to enter into the community of Christ.

266
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,280
 No man-made barriers for those who want to enter

267
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,940
 into the community of Christ.

268
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,360
 So let's think about it this way, right?

269
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,480
 If you're here listening today,

270
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,520
 if you would call yourself a follower of Jesus,

271
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,960
 think back.

272
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,400
 Think back to when, before you became a Christian,

273
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,180
 before you came to know Jesus.

274
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,920
 What was your life like back then?

275
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,440
 Like most people, like myself,

276
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,900
 you probably wrestled with a lot of doubt, right?

277
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,460
 Questions and challenges as you began to come to grips

278
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,500
 with what it means to be a life,

279
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,360
 to live a life as a Christian, as a Christ follower.

280
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,320
 Right, there's probably already enough obstacles

281
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
 that you had to overcome without people

282
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,080
 putting more barriers up in the way.

283
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,540
 In fact, being separated from Christ,

284
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,360
 it's a terrible place to be, Paul says.

285
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,120
 There's five things that you are at a disadvantage at

286
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,520
 before you knew Jesus, okay?

287
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,400
 These are, okay, these are the things.

288
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,660
 You are separated from Christ,

289
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,080
 you are excluded from citizenship,

290
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,760
 foreigners to the covenant, without hope, without God.

291
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,160
 This is the way Paul is describing the Gentiles, okay?

292
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,300
 But it's also relevant to us.

293
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,680
 Before you come to know Jesus,

294
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,560
 before you are in God's people,

295
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,720
 these are the five things that you are

296
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,760
 sort of at a disadvantage for.

297
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,300
 And they come together to make a point,

298
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,400
 so let's talk about it.

299
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,560
 Firstly, being separated from Christ, right?

300
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,160
 Means you probably didn't even have the idea

301
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,760
 that there was a salvation that you needed, right?

302
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,480
 That there was a savior out there

303
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,560
 that would come to rescue humanity,

304
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,360
 that you were a sinner, indeed, of rescuing from your sins.

305
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,880
 Right, because like what Pastor Andrew said

306
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,160
 last week as well, right,

307
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,840
 back then you were spiritually dead, right?

308
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,540
 Dead people do not have the ability

309
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,200
 to raise themselves from the dead.

310
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,960
 Dead people need a savior, need someone to intervene,

311
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,640
 to give them the resurrection power

312
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,020
 to raise them from the dead.

313
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,840
 You cannot save yourself.

314
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,340
 You needed rescue.

315
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,400
 So that's what it means to be separated from Christ.

316
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,000
 Now, because the Gentiles weren't part

317
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,920
 of God's original people as well,

318
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,760
 they also didn't share in the first covenant,

319
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,320
 the blessings and the promises

320
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,840
 that God had originally planned for his people, right?

321
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,320
 The Abrahamic, the Mosaic, the Davidic covenants,

322
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,440
 they weren't a part of that.

323
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,360
 They were outsiders, which means back then

324
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,360
 they couldn't participate in God's promises.

325
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,640
 And therefore, that means they also had no hope

326
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,280
 because they had no God.

327
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,400
 Well, maybe they had a little bit of fake sense of hope

328
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,000
 and a little bit of idea of some gods, right?

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,280
 As we have discovered, there were so many gods

330
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,960
 that people, the Gentiles of Ephesus,

331
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,200
 before they came to know Jesus,

332
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,920
 were probably worshiping all sorts of different gods

333
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,000
 and idols that were a part of the culture.

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,640
 And in the same way, it probably was for us too.

335
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,160
 Before you came to Jesus,

336
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,920
 think about the things you used to put your hope in.

337
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,880
 Right, think about the things you might use to worship.

338
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,600
 Some of us might have come from homes and households

339
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,720
 that literally worship idols.

340
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,240
 For others, it might be idols of power and prestige

341
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,600
 and all these things in culture

342
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,960
 that we tend to put our hopes and dreams in.

343
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,480
 Whatever it is, this isn't true hope,

344
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,080
 and this isn't putting your hope in the true God.

345
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,460
 We lack connection to the one true God.

346
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,240
 We lack connection to hope,

347
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,820
 God who is the source of all life.

348
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,440
 So it's not a good picture.

349
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,960
 It's pretty clear what Paul's trying to say.

350
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,960
 We, like the Gentiles, were once about as far away

351
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,620
 from God as one could be.

352
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,840
 So let me ask you again, think about it.

353
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,840
 Do you remember a time when you were far away from Jesus,

354
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,160
 when you did not know him as your savior?

355
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,680
 Or perhaps if you're listening right now

356
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,240
 and you don't quite know Jesus as your savior yet,

357
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,880
 maybe you're sitting here listening,

358
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,160
 you're just exploring,

359
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,560
 you've heard a little bit about this Christianity thing,

360
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,740
 but you're not sure how legit it all is,

361
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,080
 and you're wondering, what is this talking about?

362
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,980
 What is this hope, what is this God?

363
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,640
 Let me say this very clearly, and I say this with love.

364
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,400
 At one point, all of us have been separated from Christ.

365
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
 All of us, right?

366
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,320
 And because we were separated,

367
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,440
 we weren't part of his promises.

368
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,320
 Of course God loves all people,

369
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,640
 but there's a certain benefit, there's certain promises,

370
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,240
 there's certain function as God's children

371
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,500
 that you can only know once you enter

372
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,580
 into a relationship with him.

373
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:28,140
 The point is this, being separated from Christ

374
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,340
 is not a good place to be.

375
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,600
 In fact, being separated from Jesus

376
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,900
 is probably the worst state that you could find yourself in.

377
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,420
 And I know that sounds drastic,

378
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,940
 but I don't say it lightly either, right?

379
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,220
 Because I know amongst us, in this church,

380
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,160
 in our city, in our world,

381
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,000
 there are people in so many different situations

382
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,740
 walking through some terrible things,

383
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,040
 walking through pain, trauma,

384
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,640
 stuff that you can't even think of,

385
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,040
 things you wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy.

386
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
 These things are tough, and yes,

387
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,680
 when we see people walking through these things,

388
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,480
 we need to walk alongside them, fight for them,

389
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,560
 pray for the healing, bring justice

390
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,080
 to those who are suffering.

391
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,720
 But I would say this, a person who is suffering,

392
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 who is in pain, but who knows and is connected to Jesus

393
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,940
 is ultimately in a better place

394
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,080
 than someone who is comfortable,

395
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,380
 but is living without hope and without God.

396
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,180
 To be living in this world without hope and without God

397
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,180
 is a true tragedy, and it's as true then as it is today.

398
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,420
 But this is the good news.

399
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,820
 But now, Paul says, but now,

400
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,940
 we don't have to live this way.

401
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,260
 We don't have to live a life separated from God.

402
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,720
 We don't have to live a life separate from Jesus.

403
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,380
 We can enjoy his blessings.

404
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,620
 We can live in the calling and the purpose

405
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,160
 that he gives to us.

406
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,340
 We have that hope.

407
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,460
 We have God because in Christ Jesus,

408
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,460
 you who were once far away have been brought near

409
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,080
 by the blood of Christ.

410
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
 Jesus has done that for us.

411
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,460
 We have been brought near by Christ

412
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,620
 through his sacrifice, through his blood.

413
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,540
 And amen and praise God for this.

414
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,600
 This is the part that we could have never done for ourselves.

415
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,740
 Jesus has given us life.

416
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,740
 His incomparably great power has been at work within us,

417
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,580
 and this is nothing we can do for ourselves.

418
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,460
 And we can't do anything else but say thank you

419
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,160
 and accept his grace and his love and his mercy.

420
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,860
 But like I said, that's just the starting point.

421
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,260
 And being brought near to Jesus means a new era,

422
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,380
 a new season, a new direction in your life has begun.

423
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,340
 A new way to live is on offer.

424
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,480
 And this new way to live is not just about

425
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,740
 a certain group of people now.

426
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,140
 It's not just about individuals being brought close

427
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,540
 to Christ, but this is talking about all people,

428
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,900
 Paul is saying Jews and Gentiles alike.

429
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,620
 Two people that were once enemies with each other

430
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,300
 have now come together to become one,

431
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
 and this is where the challenge is.

432
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,780
 Because this new way to live involves peace.

433
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,300
 And it involves peace not just the peace

434
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,540
 that you have with God, but peace with each other.

435
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
 It involves everyone living as if there were

436
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,980
 no barriers between us, living as if nothing

437
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,340
 would be able to separate us from each other.

438
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,500
 Paul goes on to say this.

439
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two groups one

440
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,660
 and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall

441
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,500
 of hostility by setting aside in his flesh

442
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,380
 the law with its commands and regulations.

443
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,700
 His purpose was to create in himself one new humanity

444
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,940
 out of the two, thus making peace.

445
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,860
 And in one body to reconcile both of them to God

446
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,660
 through the cross, to which he put to death,

447
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,680
 by which he put to death their hostility.

448
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,740
 Peace.

449
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,480
 Right, peace, this is the word that the world

450
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,480
 is crying out for at the moment.

451
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,260
 Apart from the bigger, more obvious wars

452
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,180
 that we see in our news feeds every day,

453
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,700
 Ukraine and Russia, Israel and Palestine,

454
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,500
 dominating the news 24/7 these days,

455
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,580
 but actually there's about 110 other armed conflicts

456
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,180
 going on in the world right now.

457
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,180
 We need peace.

458
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,620
 We want peace in this world.

459
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,180
 And indeed, we could do a whole sermon series

460
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,820
 on war and violence and how it breaks God's heart,

461
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,620
 the injustice of war, and when we see these things,

462
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,740
 we get moved to pray, right, we want these conflicts to end

463
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,360
 and we get passionate, we start social media campaigns,

464
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,180
 all that kind of stuff, and this is good.

465
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,180
 We want to raise awareness about these things.

466
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,480
 Great, that's fine.

467
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,460
 But perhaps before we wanna do something

468
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,940
 about these major wars we see around us,

469
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,680
 we need to address the conflicts and hostilities

470
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,340
 that lie closer to home.

471
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,800
 And this is what I wanna focus on today.

472
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
 Right, because for Paul and the Ephesians,

473
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,040
 these hostilities were close to home, right?

474
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,680
 They were between the Jews and the Gentiles.

475
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 The prejudice, the hatred, the racism

476
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,800
 between the two groups was intense for many reasons.

477
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,320
 And so Paul's saying, we need to deal with this.

478
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,720
 We need to break down any hostility,

479
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
 any barriers that are stopping us

480
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,440
 from coming together as one right now.

481
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
 And so circumcision was one of those things,

482
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
 but the other thing that was keeping them separated

483
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,080
 was the Old Testament law.

484
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,580
 The Old Testament regulations that God had once

485
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,880
 commanded them to live by.

486
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
 Now here's the thing.

487
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,240
 For a season, the Old Testament laws

488
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
 were given to the Israelites were good, right?

489
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,960
 They were used to protect them

490
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,740
 from becoming like the nations around them.

491
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,200
 You see what happens when you read through the Old Testament.

492
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,040
 Every time the Israelites step away from those boundaries,

493
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,520
 right, they get carried away, they start worshiping idols,

494
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,200
 then God has to send all sorts of ways

495
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
 to let them know they've gone wrong, right?

496
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,360
 And then they start the whole cycle over again, right?

497
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,920
 Wait, first kings, second kings,

498
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,840
 all these kind of things keep happening

499
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,200
 because the Israelites fail to live in the regulation,

500
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,620
 in the protection of the laws that God has given to them.

501
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,160
 Now for a season, those were good.

502
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,560
 But very quickly, these laws also became

503
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,120
 a source of pride and arrogance.

504
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,080
 Meaning instead of being a fence to protect the Israelites,

505
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,040
 they started using it as a wall, as a barrier,

506
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,520
 as a sign of hostility to prevent people from coming in,

507
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
 to exclude people, to say, we're the people of God,

508
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,520
 we don't want you to be a part of us.

509
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,980
 Right, people became so focused

510
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,300
 on following these rules and regulations,

511
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,700
 they forgot that the purpose of these rules

512
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,160
 was to keep them close to God in the first place,

513
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,840
 not to make themselves look good as rule followers

514
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,320
 and as regulation followers.

515
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,780
 This is why Jesus gets angry

516
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,700
 with some of the religious leaders and Pharisees

517
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,840
 of his time.

518
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,120
 He calls them things like brooder vipers

519
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,560
 and whitewashed tombs.

520
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,840
 You look good on the outside, but in reality,

521
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,960
 your hearts are far away from God.

522
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,180
 Remember this, the point is that we have been brought near

523
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,600
 by the blood of Christ.

524
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,880
 And on the cross as Jesus died,

525
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,840
 his blood fulfills the old covenant.

526
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,980
 And so now, those who want to worship God

527
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,720
 don't have to do through rules and rituals and sacrifices,

528
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,680
 they simply have to come.

529
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,320
 In doing so, Jesus' death killed the hostility

530
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,100
 between Jews and Gentiles.

531
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,680
 The one who was slain also slayed the hate

532
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,800
 between two groups that were at enmity with each other.

533
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,520
 And so the result is this, something beautiful,

534
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,200
 even something surprising.

535
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,480
 See, the plan all along wasn't to make Gentiles

536
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
 become more Jewish so they could join

537
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
 into the nation of Israel.

538
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,240
 His plan was to create in himself one new humanity

539
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,400
 out of the two, thus making peace.

540
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,120
 This was never about conforming one people group

541
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,660
 to become more like the other,

542
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,920
 not about Gentiles making them Jewish

543
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,400
 or Jewish into Gentiles.

544
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,320
 It was always about creating something new,

545
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,840
 which is the body of Christ.

546
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,720
 It's almost romantic, the union of two groups

547
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,580
 coming together in one humanity.

548
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,200
 It sounds a bit like what Jesus says about marriage.

549
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
 The two become one flesh.

550
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,240
 They are no longer two, but one flesh.

551
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,480
 And so good, right?

552
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,040
 Bravo, we cheer at this.

553
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,760
 This is amazing.

554
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,280
 Two groups that were once at conflict with each other

555
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,520
 coming together to create something even more beautiful.

556
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,140
 It's like a fairy tale come true.

557
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,080
 Everyone likes that story.

558
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,960
 In fact, if you might say, actually, you know what?

559
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,320
 We've done this as a church.

560
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,280
 We're good.

561
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,000
 I mean, look around us.

562
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,020
 There's people from all over the world

563
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,480
 sitting with each other.

564
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
 We have peace.

565
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,900
 There's no fighting within our worship services.

566
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,380
 I don't really hear people cursing at each other.

567
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,620
 We're super friendly in this church.

568
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,420
 We're friendly, we invite new people.

569
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,000
 We even do the awkward thing sometimes

570
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,060
 when we sit down and say hello to your neighbor

571
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,260
 and no one ever goes, "Ee, not this person," right?

572
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,160
 Yeah, we're good here.

573
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,380
 We even pray with each other sometimes, right?

574
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,480
 Isn't that great?

575
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,900
 Okay, yeah, I will give us that.

576
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,520
 We don't have the very obvious Gentile Jewish divisions

577
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,720
 that Paul was talking about.

578
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,640
 We might not be openly fighting with each other, right?

579
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,580
 It's not the USC every time we gather together to worship.

580
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,680
 At the same time, I don't think we should be so naive

581
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,600
 to say that we've got everything right

582
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,320
 and there's no work to be done in creating unity and peace

583
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,800
 within this family, this body of Christ.

584
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,400
 I would say we shouldn't be so blind

585
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,620
 that in fact there might be some wars and hostilities

586
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,100
 that we hold against each other.

587
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
 But here's the problem.

588
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,380
 It's hard to see where these hostilities lay

589
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,420
 when you're not at the receiving end of them.

590
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,980
 It's hard to see where people do not feel at peace

591
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,400
 when we don't put ourselves in the shoes

592
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,320
 of those on the receiving end of injustice.

593
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,700
 Something I experienced myself really opened my eyes to this.

594
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,020
 So a few years ago, we were visiting my wife's wife.

595
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,080
 I say that three times, I said that now.

596
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,560
 I said it every time.

597
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,800
 My wife's wife, who's that, Kayla?

598
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 I don't know, right?

599
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,300
 My wife's family in Texas.

600
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,080
 We took a road trip.

601
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,840
 And one of the stops we had on this road trip

602
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
 was in Nashville.

603
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,360
 We were going from Texas all the way up to Buffalo,

604
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,760
 into Niagara.

605
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,640
 So we looked at a nice, long road trip.

606
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,800
 And one of the stops was Tennessee.

607
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,280
 And I was super excited.

608
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,560
 Tennessee, the home of country music.

609
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,240
 I have to admit, I love country music.

610
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,520
 I might not look like it, but I love country music.

611
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,720
 Country music and hip hop.

612
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,280
 That's what dominates my Spotify playlist.

613
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,320
 Ask Emma and Promise, one of these days

614
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,040
 I'm gonna lead worship doing a country song

615
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,600
 and we'll see how it goes.

616
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,920
 But Nashville, is there anyone from Nashville

617
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,640
 or been to Nashville?

618
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,560
 Beautiful city, right?

619
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,920
 Amazing food, great atmosphere.

620
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,720
 But you walk down the high street, the main street,

621
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,440
 and there's about a thousand cowboy hats,

622
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,800
 aspiring musicians, a beautiful place.

623
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,320
 And so we decided to go to one of the honky tonks

624
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,840
 that they have.

625
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,800
 A honky tonk, by the way, is one of those bars

626
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,400
 that you go, it's like a dance hall.

627
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,240
 Live band, play music, you can have a beer,

628
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,340
 sit with people and have a good time, dance,

629
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,480
 and do all that kind of stuff, okay?

630
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,200
 So, imagine the scene.

631
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,800
 Here I am, a Chinese guy, walking into this honky tonk

632
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,220
 with my white Texan wife, hoping to have a good time.

633
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,480
 But the moment I walk in, right, and it wasn't everybody,

634
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,720
 but I just felt this two pair of eyes

635
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,260
 just staring at me immediately, the moment I walk in.

636
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,940
 Right, and I see that the man kind of leans over

637
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,720
 to the woman, whispers something in her ear,

638
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,560
 and having a conversation back and forth with each other,

639
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,160
 there's visibly pointing at me now.

640
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,400
 Okay, I have to admit, I didn't hear what they said,

641
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,000
 right, they could have been, whoa, look at that guy,

642
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,040
 he's super cool, right?

643
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,640
 (audience laughing)

644
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,920
 They could have been saying that, okay,

645
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
 but that wasn't the vibe I got from them,

646
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,420
 that wasn't the sense I got from them, okay?

647
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,520
 What they were communicating actually was,

648
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,240
 what are you doing here?

649
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,200
 You see that guy that just walked in?

650
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
 Why did he just walk in here?

651
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,000
 He doesn't belong in here.

652
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,740
 Obviously, they didn't want me there.

653
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,200
 Now, apart from Brittany, who was with me,

654
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,800
 no one else noticed, right?

655
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,280
 The rest of the people that were with didn't notice, right?

656
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,120
 Why should they?

657
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,280
 No one's ever looked at them in that way,

658
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,960
 no one's ever judged them in that way.

659
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,520
 They've been to a thousand honky tonks.

660
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,020
 Every time they go in, they have a fun,

661
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,760
 they have a good time, all right, it's great.

662
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,240
 But for me, the night was over, all right?

663
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,040
 Then the moment that happened, I just wanted

664
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,880
 to get out of there as quickly as possible,

665
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,920
 and so we left.

666
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,900
 Okay, let's bring it a bit closer to home.

667
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,720
 When I walked into the building this morning,

668
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,360
 as I do every Sunday, when I walk in, I feel good.

669
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,040
 I feel confident, right?

670
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,760
 I feel like I belong here.

671
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,120
 I don't worry about how people are gonna treat me.

672
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
 I don't feel like people are gonna say,

673
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,200
 "You're not supposed to be here."

674
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,040
 I've never experienced anything like that here.

675
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,500
 People are always kind and friendly and respectful.

676
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,720
 For some strange reason, some of you even want

677
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,640
 to come and speak to me, okay?

678
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,520
 It's great for me.

679
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,820
 But I wonder if we could confidently say

680
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,920
 that this is the same experience everyone has

681
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,500
 when they come into this building.

682
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,100
 I wonder if this is the same experience

683
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,640
 that people can say they have when they go

684
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,160
 into other places, other establishments here in Hong Kong.

685
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,560
 I wonder for some if coming even here to the Vine,

686
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,220
 walking into this church building for worship on Sunday

687
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,020
 might feel a bit like me walking

688
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,480
 to the honky-tonk that night.

689
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,620
 Perhaps for some of us, coming here every Sunday,

690
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,980
 there's just a bit of nervousness,

691
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,780
 a little bit of worry about whether or not

692
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,240
 people are gonna treat me with respect.

693
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,220
 Maybe some of us come into this space feeling

694
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,380
 there are walls, there are unspoken rules

695
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,720
 and hostilities between us as a body of Christ.

696
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,320
 Just because you haven't felt it or seen it

697
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,920
 doesn't mean it's not happening.

698
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,400
 In fact, one of the most powerful barriers

699
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,720
 that happen without us even realizing it,

700
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,640
 and it's one of the ways it happens most frequently,

701
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,920
 is with our language and the way we speak

702
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,040
 about each other and other people.

703
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,160
 And I'm speaking specifically to Cantonese,

704
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,080
 Hong Kong Chinese, Cantonese speakers here.

705
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,760
 But even if you're not a Cantonese speaker,

706
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,240
 you can probably contextualize it to apply it

707
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,560
 to your own identity, your own culture

708
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,140
 from what your sphere is.

709
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,380
 Because I would say this, a lot of Cantonese language

710
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,880
 is very casually racist, not even low-key racist,

711
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,180
 like properly racist.

712
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:28,320
 Common racial slurs in Cantonese,

713
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,180
 terms like hak kwai when we're referring to black people.

714
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,800
 Things like a-tah or a-sing when we're referring

715
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,000
 to Indian, Pakistani, and South Asian people groups.

716
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,520
 These are terms that Chinese Cantonese speakers

717
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,060
 say behind the backs of these people

718
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,760
 as a derogatory way of referring to them.

719
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,080
 You could even say guai lo is sort of like

720
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,000
 embraced right now as a term, but if you think about it,

721
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,680
 the origins of that aren't very friendly either.

722
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,140
 Or what about the way we refer to our Filipino sisters?

723
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,620
 The term ban muy when we're talking about

724
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,920
 our Filipino foreign domestic workers.

725
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,240
 In fact, when it comes to them, right,

726
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,500
 we forget that they are human beings sometimes.

727
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,960
 Some of the conversations over here are shameful

728
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,680
 when it comes to the way we refer to our Filipino sisters

729
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,960
 who live and work in the city, serving our families.

730
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,240
 Often they're talked about like they're commodities.

731
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,280
 Oh, this one's not good, this one's not good at that,

732
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,080
 this one, and then they talk about them

733
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,360
 like they're commodities, things that they can get rid of

734
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,600
 when it's no longer convenient for them.

735
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,920
 This is the kind of language we use very frequently.

736
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,420
 What about attitudes towards Hong Kongers

737
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,500
 used towards our mainland brothers and sisters?

738
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,620
 Now I struggle with this.

739
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,220
 When I see those tour groups getting off the bus,

740
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,060
 when I'm being crowded on the Star Ferry,

741
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,140
 when I'm just trying to relax or take in the views

742
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,940
 or enjoy the Star Ferry ride and there's like 500 people

743
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,700
 walking in at the same time, it's all loud and crazy,

744
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,220
 I admit that the feelings that come out in my heart,

745
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,940
 in my mind, are not very pleasant sometimes.

746
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,000
 They're ugly and they're wrong.

747
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,420
 I wrestle with this.

748
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,440
 We need to do better than this, church, right?

749
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,580
 We need to do better than this.

750
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,020
 We can do better than this.

751
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,160
 Because if this is the way we talk,

752
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,080
 then how are we gonna relate to each other

753
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,440
 if this is the sort of like, in the back of our minds,

754
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,760
 this is the prejudice that we've already set up.

755
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,400
 These are walls of hostility

756
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,160
 that we've already set up against other people.

757
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,160
 So we need to do better.

758
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,540
 This means watching your own language,

759
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,620
 being aware of the words that come out of your mouth.

760
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,420
 This might even mean sticking out a little bit

761
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,120
 when you overhear conversations

762
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,300
 or when you're amongst your friends

763
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,100
 and they start throwing out those terms sort of freely.

764
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,340
 We need to call it out for the sin it is

765
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,020
 and refuse to participate in it.

766
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,400
 The point is this.

767
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,180
 If the church is just a reflection

768
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,100
 of what our culture is like,

769
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,800
 especially when it comes to racial and cultural prejudice,

770
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,600
 then I would say it shows we haven't fully understood

771
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,560
 the message of the gospel even.

772
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,840
 If we do not have unity that Jesus has called us to,

773
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,800
 then maybe we haven't fully embraced

774
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,260
 the power of the cross.

775
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,920
 We fail to see God's heart.

776
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,080
 His desire was to bring all people unity,

777
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,100
 to reconcile all people together.

778
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,260
 Yes, Jesus died for your sins on the cross,

779
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:35,120
 so you could have a transforming, powerful, meaningful life,

780
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,040
 all that good stuff.

781
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,900
 We know that.

782
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,060
 But let me read verse 15 and 16 once again.

783
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,220
 His purpose then was to create in himself

784
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:48,100
 one new humanity out of the two, thus making peace.

785
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,260
 And in one body to reconcile both of them to God

786
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,280
 through the cross by which he put to death

787
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,820
 their hostility, all hostility.

788
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,960
 So if we claim to love Jesus, we claim to love his word,

789
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,620
 we claim to love worshiping him,

790
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,580
 then we must take seriously the demands

791
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,940
 that he has called us to live in unity

792
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,860
 and in peace with each other.

793
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,380
 This means we have work to do, church.

794
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,460
 We have to be serious about continuing

795
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,580
 to tear down the barriers, both seen and unseen,

796
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,980
 starting with this family right here,

797
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,000
 because that is exactly what Jesus has done.

798
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,580
 And if we don't do that, or if we even worse,

799
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,260
 continue to put up walls,

800
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,420
 then we're literally trying to undo what God has done.

801
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,000
 It's literally swapping the truth of God's word for a lie.

802
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,340
 It's rebelling against what God has, which is sin.

803
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,100
 We don't wanna be a church, right,

804
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,300
 that says peace, peace, when there is no peace.

805
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,140
 Right, like I said, there's no conflict happening here,

806
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,460
 but peace isn't just the absence of conflict.

807
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,080
 You can squash conflict in many different ways.

808
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,720
 You could get an autocratic leader or someone like that

809
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,180
 to come and just dominate with his power.

810
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,140
 Nobody's, everybody's too afraid to make a move, right?

811
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,120
 That could look like peace on the surface,

812
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,640
 but that's not true peace.

813
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,000
 Peace is where everybody can flourish.

814
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Peace is when everybody can be what God created them to be,

815
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,200
 regardless of age, gender, color, social status,

816
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,000
 whatever other barriers that we might have put up.

817
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,240
 The point is this, Jesus longs for his church

818
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,960
 to overcome the cultural barriers of racism, nationalism,

819
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,560
 economic pride, and to embody a practical way

820
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,740
 which he created it to be,

821
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,040
 an attractive yet countercultural family of people

822
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,060
 very different from one another,

823
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,760
 but who love each other deeply

824
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,940
 and display the presence of God who is near.

825
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:55,080
 The presence of God is best displayed in a church

826
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,560
 that is at true peace with each other,

827
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,220
 that has true unity with each other.

828
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,320
 We want this place to be a place

829
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,880
 where the presence of God is pleased to dwell.

830
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,200
 That's the whole point of coming together as a church,

831
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
 isn't it?

832
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,360
 If the presence of God isn't here, then we're not a church.

833
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,660
 The building, this isn't what makes the church.

834
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,640
 The presence of God with us, that's what makes us a church.

835
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,420
 And so if we're gathering without God's presence,

836
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,000
 we're not a church.

837
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,700
 This is like a TED Talk every Sunday,

838
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,840
 motivational speaker, good band, okay, at best.

839
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,080
 At worst, we're like a cult that gets together every Sunday.

840
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,240
 That's not who we want to be.

841
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,360
 We want to be a place where Jesus sits at the heart,

842
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,800
 at the foundation of everything that we do,

843
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
 because it's only through Jesus, Paul says,

844
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,440
 that the whole building is joined together.

845
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,360
 In Christ, the whole building is joined together.

846
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,600
 He becomes the dwelling place which God lives by his spirit.

847
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,040
 This is the temple of the Lord.

848
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,300
 And as we have said, when this happens,

849
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,260
 then there is true peace.

850
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,360
 Then there is true unity, when there is reconciliation

851
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,220
 between all people.

852
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,040
 So it's a big calling.

853
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,980
 It's a big calling.

854
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,120
 But we have to keep working at it.

855
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,460
 And God knows this, right?

856
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,940
 It's going to be a journey.

857
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,160
 Because this is what Paul says.

858
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,360
 In him, you too are being built together

859
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,160
 to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.

860
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,040
 When he says being built, right,

861
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,040
 this means it's a work in progress.

862
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,000
 We are not gonna get perfect at this.

863
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,660
 Jesus knows that.

864
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,600
 But it reminds us that we need to keep going.

865
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,440
 We need to be willing to do the hard work,

866
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,560
 excuse me, to go through the process of continuing

867
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,360
 to figure out what it means to be built together.

868
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,720
 This is an ongoing work and it's not going to end

869
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,620
 until Jesus returns again.

870
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,960
 This isn't a project that we take on for a while

871
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,280
 and put on the back burner, right?

872
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,320
 It's, you know, Social Justice Awareness Week.

873
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,680
 So we take on this work and then we put it

874
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
 on the back burner again.

875
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,400
 This is something we have to commit and promise each other

876
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,900
 that we're going to do.

877
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,560
 Always to work on peace.

878
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,160
 Always to seek unity.

879
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,060
 Always to be reconcilers.

880
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,680
 Because this is the type of community

881
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,360
 that God is delighted to dwell in.

882
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,720
 In fact, I would say this is the kind of peace

883
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,860
 that the world needs to see.

884
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,140
 This is how we become a reflection of what's in heaven

885
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,880
 as done on earth.

886
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,440
 We can't just be a gathering of people if God is not here.

887
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,560
 But it has to be done under the church.

888
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,660
 The only way that we ever will see true peace in the world,

889
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,080
 again, this is why the church is so important.

890
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,720
 The only thing that brings people together

891
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,920
 that will last forever, the only thing that everyone

892
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,800
 can be fully unified under is Jesus.

893
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,680
 Because he is our source of life.

894
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,240
 He is everyone's source of life.

895
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,080
 So church, let's build ourselves up.

896
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,200
 Let's be that temple, let's be that space

897
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,280
 that God is pleased to dwell in

898
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,640
 where he sees his children gathering together

899
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,220
 no matter who they are and where they're from,

900
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,460
 breaking down these walls of hostility.

901
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,460
 I'm gonna give you three tips, three action steps,

902
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,680
 three things you can take home and consider,

903
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,980
 practical things you can do to start doing this.

904
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,340
 These steps are taken from the Difference course.

905
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,580
 And if you Google Difference course,

906
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,740
 you'll find it's a fantastic resource

907
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,240
 to learn more about what peacemaking actually means.

908
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,580
 So three things we can do.

909
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,420
 Firstly, it's this, be curious.

910
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,940
 Be curious.

911
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,840
 This means listening to each other.

912
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,320
 This means learning to see the world

913
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,240
 through other people's eyes.

914
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,400
 Sitting down with someone that you're not familiar with,

915
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,360
 sitting down with someone who has a different background

916
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,180
 to you and hearing their story

917
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,760
 and allow them to hear yours as well.

918
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,640
 Ask each other the questions.

919
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,220
 The moment we get to know each other,

920
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,480
 so many barriers will naturally come down

921
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,180
 just as we get to know each other.

922
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,200
 Be present.

923
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,040
 Now don't just do it for the sake of doing it,

924
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,200
 but put your heart into it.

925
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,340
 Be present with each other.

926
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,280
 Meet each other with authenticity and confidence.

927
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,660
 Stick up for each other when things come up.

928
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,880
 Be advocates for each other.

929
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,040
 Be present.

930
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,360
 And finally, re-imagine.

931
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,280
 This means that we have to have that faith,

932
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,920
 that hope that this work can be done.

933
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,560
 The work of peace can be done,

934
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,360
 despite how bleak things look at times.

935
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,760
 Be reassured that this is God's heart.

936
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,840
 And if the Lord desires to see this happen,

937
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,940
 then nothing can stop it from happening.

938
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,300
 And of course, finally, we have to pray.

939
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,480
 We have to pray.

940
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,660
 We pray because the enemy hates unity.

941
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,000
 Well, this whole mess with sin

942
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,400
 started when the enemy tried to put distance,

943
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,480
 successfully, between humans and God.

944
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,120
 Right, this is why Paul tells us,

945
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,760
 later in Ephesians,

946
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,740
 do not give the devil any space to work in this.

947
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,200
 We have to keep working on our unity.

948
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,360
 Don't let the sun go down

949
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,160
 while you're angry with your brother and sister.

950
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,560
 This is how the devil gets a foothold.

951
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,120
 In other words, all the barriers that we have put up,

952
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,100
 all the barriers that have been threatened to put up,

953
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,160
 we need to deal with, and we need to deal with it now.

954
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,140
 And so, church, we must pray.

955
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,300
 The task is large,

956
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,760
 and it's gonna take everybody working together

957
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,460
 to put effort into this.

958
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,640
 But know that as we do this,

959
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,800
 this is what pleases God's heart.

960
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,800
 This is the kind of church that God wants to see.

961
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,040
 This is what the church is called to be.

962
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,080
 This is what the world needs to see in answer

963
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,520
 to the fighting and the violence

964
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,160
 and the wars that are going on out there,

965
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,800
 that if we're unified under the one true God,

966
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,280
 under the source of all life,

967
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,160
 we can truly have peace,

968
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,360
 no matter who we are, where we come from.

969
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,560
 We can truly be that place where we live

970
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,220
 without any barriers, without any prejudice,

971
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,760
 where we come together, get to know each other,

972
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,640
 because that's how God has drawn us together under his name.

973
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,920
 You have been called to be a peacemaker.

974
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,620
 So, church, let's go and make peace in the name of Jesus.

975
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,680
 Would you pray with me?

976
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,840
 [silence]

977
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:50,680
 Yeah, Lord, we just,

978
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:56,440
 yeah, we acknowledge that this is a great challenge

979
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,480
 that you set for us,

980
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,880
 and there's a lot of homework we can do on this,

981
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,520
 a lot of ways we can reflect on

982
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,900
 how we've participated in this,

983
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,660
 the own barriers that we've put up in our own hearts.

984
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,080
 Even within this body,

985
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,480
 perhaps there's some of us who have felt judged

986
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,240
 and mistreated,

987
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,440
 discriminated against.

988
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:30,080
 If that's where we've been, if that's our story,

989
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,480
 we pray for comfort,

990
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,880
 and we pray for the truth to speak louder than the lies,

991
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,240
 to say that God loves you and recognizes you

992
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,040
 and welcomes you, no matter what other people have said.

993
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,760
 And for all of us, we need to look at the prejudices

994
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,200
 that we hold in our own hearts,

995
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,360
 to see the ways we've put up walls and barriers

996
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,960
 that might have stopped people from entering

997
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,480
 into knowing who you are,

998
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,880
 where we haven't been a reflection of your love.

999
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,960
 Jesus, in those ways, work in our hearts,

1000
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,880
 help us to understand the other,

1001
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,360
 people who are different to us.

1002
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,620
 And culturally, yes, it's a cultural, it's a race thing,

1003
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,840
 but also through the generations,

1004
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,020
 through class and socioeconomic barriers,

1005
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,680
 through gender barriers,

1006
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,180
 through sexual orientation barriers,

1007
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,920
 through social status barriers, whatever it may be, Lord,

1008
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,760
 you have come so we can have true peace and unity

1009
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,240
 under your name.

1010
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,080
 So help us be a church that reflects that.

1011
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,880
 Help us be a church that always prays for your peace,

1012
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,240
 for true peace and true unity,

1013
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,040
 so that we can demonstrate to the world

1014
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,280
 that when we come under the all-powerful,

1015
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,840
 almighty, all-loving name of Jesus,

1016
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,360
 he creates us to be something more beautiful,

1017
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,400
 a new humanity where we can all live and thrive

1018
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,600
 and be who God has called us to be,

1019
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,960
 the unique gifts that you've given everybody,

1020
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,880
 where we can truly fit together as one body

1021
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,920
 and function for the glory of the name of Jesus.

1022
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,220
 So keep working in us, Lord, and keep us near to you,

1023
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,260
 keep us near to each other.

1024
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,820
 Grant us your peace, we pray, in Jesus' name.

1025
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,300
 Amen.
