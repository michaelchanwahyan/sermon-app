1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 Amen, amen.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,680
 Can we put our hands together

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,800
 and thank our worship team as always.

4
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,200
 Have a seat, it's great to have you here.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,920
 Welcome to the 11 o'clock service.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,840
 We have four services at the Vine on a Sunday,

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,200
 9, 15, 11, two, and four.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,520
 If you are here, you're here at the 11.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,160
 Welcome everybody online, it's so good to see you.

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,480
 I know that people are tuning in

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,200

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,680

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,160
 It's always good to know that the Vine Church

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,000

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,520
 It is also many of you that are watching in this moment.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,560
 So welcome to you and welcome to each person

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,440
 that managed to get a ticket that is here,

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,240
 that is present, that didn't have a staycation

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,200
 on the long weekend, welcome.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
 It's great to have you here with us as well.

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,520
 I wanna start by telling you about the day

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,360
 that I was arrested.

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,840
 So I was 19 years old at the time.

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,680
 I was in the first year of university.

28
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,840
 Hands up if you were arrested

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
 in your first year at university.

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,920
 Come on, let's see those, okay.

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,560
 Now, the only thing you really need to know

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,960
 about me back in those days

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,680
 when I was a 19 year old at university

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,320
 was that I had very long hair.

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,920
 I'm not just talking about like sort of a little bit longer

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,280
 than you see now, like I need to get

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,120
 a little bit of a haircut.

38
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,120
 I'm talking about like seriously long hair.

39
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,960
 I had hair that kind of came down

40
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,200
 to like the middle of your back, you know,

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,600
 ponytail, I'd shave it underneath.

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,600
 I wore black all the time from head to toe.

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
 I was into death metal music, right?

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,080
 This was before I got saved, just wanna say, all right.

45
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,960
 But I was into this like crazy music.

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,680
 I was like wearing black all the time

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,480
 and I had super long hair.

48
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,000
 I thought I was super cool.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,760
 Now, the problem was I wasn't cool.

50
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,920
 The problem was I went to a university called Durham

51
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,200
 in the Northeast of England

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,280
 and Durham is a small university town,

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,680
 but there's a bit of an issue.

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,640
 Number one, the surrounding area of Durham

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
 is kind of like a working class North of England

56
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,840
 kind of surrounding area, very proud of its industry.

57
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,200
 And most of the men within the working class there

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,440
 never would have long hair.

59
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,640
 In fact, they look at long haired people as weirdos, right?

60
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,000
 Likewise, at my university,

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,320
 it was kind of like this middle to upper class university

62
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,000
 where a lot of the kids that were studying there

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,560
 had gone to public schools in the UK.

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,640
 And if you were a guy that went to public school in the UK,

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
 you did not have long hair tied in your ponytail

66
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,800
 down the middle of your back wearing black all day.

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,480
 So basically I stood out

68
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,200
 in terms of who I was at Durham like completely, right?

69
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,360
 So much so that by the end of the first year,

70
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,560
 I was thinking about cutting my hair

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,320
 just so that I could fit in a little bit better.

72
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,720
 Now on this one particular day that I got arrested,

73
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,440
 I was walking down this long road

74
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,920
 that goes from the top of where I was living at the time

75
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,760
 to the bottom of Durham where my university lecture hall was.

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,200
 And I'm walking down this road

77
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,960
 and on the other side of the road, about a hundred yards away,

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,600
 a policeman is walking up in the opposite direction.

79
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,400
 And as the policeman's walking up,

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,360
 he gazes over and he sees me coming down

81
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,640
 on the other side of the road.

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,240
 And immediately I had this sense, you know, the spider sense.

83
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,320
 There's a policeman staring at you

84
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,080
 and suddenly you don't feel like 100% comfortable anymore.

85
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,280
 Like you're like, what is wrong?

86
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 Have I done something?

87
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
 What's the problem here?

88
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,400
 And the officer crosses over onto my side of the street,

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,640
 walks right up to me and he comes straight up to me.

90
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,400
 And this was his opening words.

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,840
 He says, "You have long hair."

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,520
 And I'm like, wow, you're perceptive here today, officer.

93
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,400
 Right? I'm like, yes, I do.

94
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,320
 He's like, "You have no idea how happy I am to meet you."

95
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,640
 I'm like, oh, that's cool.

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
 He's like, "I've been searching over the whole of Durham

97
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,040
 "to find men with long hair.

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,640
 "Do you know how hard it is to find men

99
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
 "with long hair in Durham?"

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,240
 I'm like, yes, I do.

101
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,720
 'Cause I have never seen one.

102
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,480
 And he's like, "I finally found you.

103
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,800
 "And I'm wondering, would you come with me

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,400
 "and be a part of a police lineup at the police station?"

105
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,600
 'Cause it turned out that they had arrested

106
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,560
 somebody who had long hair

107
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,440
 and they were looking for five other men

108
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,200
 of about the same age, about the same height,

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,280
 with long hair to be a part of the lineup.

110
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,040
 I was like, no, I don't wanna do that.

111
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
 And he's like, "We'll pay you."

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
 I'm like, where do I sign?

113
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,720
 I'm a student, right?

114
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
 I'm like, where I'll go.

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,040
 So the next day, I'm down there at the police station.

116
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,640
 I walk into the little side room

117
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,720
 and I walk into this room and lo and behold,

118
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,560
 there's five other men in that room with long hair.

119
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,880
 Immediately, we're like best friends.

120
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,640
 It's like, where have you been all my life?

121
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,920
 We're like swapping shampoo techniques and everything.

122
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,240
 Like, it's awesome.

123
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,680
 We're like the best friends straight away.

124
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,760
 And the police officer from the other day comes in.

125
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,360
 He's like, "Right, it's very simple, very easy.

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,320
 "We're gonna give you a number.

127
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,280
 "You're gonna walk into the room here on the left

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,040
 "and you'll see some places on the floor.

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,320
 "You're gonna line up and you're gonna hold your number

130
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,720
 "and you're just gonna look forwards into the mirror

131
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,640
 "that's gonna be in front of you.

132
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,920
 "Now, when you're standing there,

133
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,600
 "we're gonna bring in this guy.

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,440
 "We're gonna bring him in.

135
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
 "He's gonna then join you in that lineup

136
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,920
 "and then the light will come on

137
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
 "and it will blind you in your face

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,360
 "and you'll just see the mirror in front of you,

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,840
 "but it's one way mirrored glass

140
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,720
 "and there's the witness behind the mirror.

141
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,200
 "And once you're standing there,

142
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,960
 "the lights are on and he's in place,

143
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,160
 "then I just want you to do whatever the voice

144
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,080
 "over the intercom tells you to do."

145
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,480
 Cool, we're like easiest money we've ever made, right?

146
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,160
 So we get given our numbers, we go into the room

147
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,240
 and I'm standing there, there's one person here,

148
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,680
 the second person, there's me here, number three.

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
 There was an empty spot in number four

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,880
 and then there was five and six.

151
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,560
 And as we're standing there, the door opens

152
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,800
 and this guy walks in.

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,080
 Now, I don't know what a criminal looks like.

154
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,440
 But this guy looked like a criminal, are you with me?

155
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,600
 Like, I don't know what he had done,

156
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,640
 but it was obvious to me that he was guilty, right?

157
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,480
 I mean, he walked in and all of us were like,

158
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,920
 "We don't look anything like this guy.

159
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,040
 "Like we might have long hair, but this guy is guilty

160
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,640
 "and we're super sweet and innocent," right?

161
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,120
 So he comes and he stands right next to me

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,440
 and immediately I'm sensing just the evil from this man.

163
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
 He's standing there and we're all standing there,

164
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,320
 we've all got our numbers, we're all looking up

165
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,240
 and the lights come on, there we go, we've started.

166
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,160
 And it's funny, right?

167
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,680
 Because if you're staring forward

168
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,120
 and you only have a mirror, you don't stare at yourself.

169
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
 So the five of us are all staring at this guy right here

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,760
 in the mirror, right?

171
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,320
 Like we're just looking at him, eyes fixed, right?

172
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,560
 So we're standing there, as he's standing there

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,760
 in that position, number four,

174
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,520
 and suddenly the voice comes on in the intercom system,

175
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,560
 "Number four, would you please stand forward?"

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,760
 And we're all like, we can't do anything,

177
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,360
 but I know that the five of us are all kind of like,

178
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,240
 "(laughs)

179
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,320
 "You know, you've..."

180
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,920
 Anyway, the guy next to me doesn't move.

181
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,760
 Like he's just standing there.

182
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,480
 I'm like, "Man, this guy is tough," you know?

183
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,080
 Number four, the voice comes again on the intercom system,

184
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,280
 "Would you please stand forward?"

185
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,520
 I mean, he just stands there, he doesn't do anything,

186
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,680
 he doesn't even move, doesn't even entwitch

187
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,600
 and we're all standing there,

188
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,840
 kind of like beginning to look a little confused

189
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,640
 and staring in the mirror at him.

190
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,080
 "Number four, would you please stand forward?"

191
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,760
 And we're like, "Come on, guy, number four, stand..."

192
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,520
 "Number four!"

193
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,120
 And I suddenly realized I'm holding number four

194
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,880
 and I stood in the wrong place in number three.

195
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,160
 And I'm standing there and I'm thinking,

196
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,680
 "Hang on a sec, whoever is behind there

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,880
 "has just called me out.

198
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,720
 "He's so obviously guilty, but I'm the one."

199
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,280
 And again, "Number four, would you please stand forward?"

200
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,840
 And I can tell this guy's standing there

201
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,120
 looking at me in the mirror like,

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
 "You can help me get off right now.

203
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,720
 "Stand forward!"

204
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,840
 I stand forward.

205
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,560
 Okay, honest story, this is what happens.

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,480
 As I stand forward,

207
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,640
 automatically something goes through my mind.

208
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,040
 Here's what I think, I go, "Did I really do it?"

209
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,600
 (audience laughing)

210
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,560
 Like, where was I on October 25th?

211
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,400
 Do you know what I mean?

212
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,760
 Like, maybe I did it and I completely forgot about it.

213
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,560
 What is the crime that maybe I had...

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,480
 And I literally began to absorb the identity

215
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,760
 that the witness behind the mirror was saying about me.

216
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,720
 For whatever reason,

217
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,080
 they thought I looked like the person who had done it.

218
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,560
 And I stepped forward and I was like,

219
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,040
 "Perhaps I actually did."

220
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,640
 I allowed just the pressure of that moment

221
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
 and everything kind of cloud my mind.

222
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,160
 And I began to feel really guilty about something

223
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,200
 that I didn't know that maybe I had done.

224
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,080
 Then the thing says, "Okay, stand back."

225
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,320
 So I stood back.

226
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
 Then the lights went off, that was it.

227
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,760
 The lights went off, the door opens, they come,

228
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,040
 they take the guy away,

229
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,360
 and then a police officer comes into the room

230
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,560
 and arrests me.

231
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,760
 Okay, I'm embellishing a little bit about that part.

232
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
 He didn't actually come in and arrest me.

233
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,280
 But he did come in and say,

234
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,560
 "Sir, we need to take you to this room over here

235
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,080
 and we need to interview and find out

236
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,920
 where were you on October 25th?

237
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,520
 And do you actually have an alibi for your presence?"

238
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,040
 Now, I hadn't done it, I wasn't in the place,

239
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,720
 I had an alibi, it was all code.

240
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,440
 So guys, just trust me, I didn't do whatever it was, okay?

241
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,520
 But when I left that place that day,

242
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,680
 here's the thought processes that were going around my mind.

243
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,800
 I realized how easy it was for someone

244
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,720
 to give me an identity

245
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,960
 and for me to absorb and take on that identity.

246
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,280
 Like it was so easy to have somebody's voice

247
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,520
 that I didn't even know,

248
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,360
 begin to shape what I actually thought about myself.

249
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,600
 Did I really do it?

250
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,800
 And I realized that our identity is so tentative,

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,880
 that our identity can be so molded and shaped

252
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,640
 by other people's perspective.

253
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,880
 And as I left it that day,

254
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,520
 I was beginning to ask myself some new questions.

255
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,000
 Like what actually does form our identity?

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,640
 Like who is it that is actually shaping

257
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
 and telling us who we are?

258
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,600
 Because so often it's the external voice from us

259
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,040
 that is shaping and telling us who we are.

260
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,000
 Years later, as I've come to faith,

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,800
 I've asked those questions in a Christian way.

262
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,400
 Like I know my identity should be in Christ Jesus.

263
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,720
 I know it should be in the gospel,

264
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,520
 the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.

265
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,080
 But I also recognize like that day,

266
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,120
 there are many voices that come to me from social media,

267
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,200
 from movies, from music, from politicians,

268
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
 from influential people in society,

269
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
 from even well-meaning friends

270
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,440
 that are telling me how I should live,

271
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,520
 how I should be shaped, who I should be.

272
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,600
 And I realized that I so often lifted

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
 into the voices out there

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,600
 rather than the voice that the Holy Spirit has put in here.

275
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,240
 And I end up shaping much of my life

276
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
 more around the external voice of others

277
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
 rather than the internal voice of God.

278
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,320
 And I realize now that I'm asking other questions

279
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,600
 about my identity.

280
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,840
 I'm asking questions like this,

281
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,440
 like what brokenness is there in my identity?

282
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,320
 Recognizing that other voices have a profound impact,

283
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,520
 what voices are there in my identity

284
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,000
 that need to be uprooted and changed?

285
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,880
 Like what are the things that the Holy Spirit

286
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,200
 wants to reestablish in me

287
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,440
 so that my identity is more rooted in the gospel,

288
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
 the life, death and resurrection of Jesus?

289
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,760
 Are you with me?

290
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,120
 Now, this is exactly what was on Paul's heart

291
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,040
 as he opens his letter to the church in Philippi.

292
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,240
 He wants to, through his opening 11 verses,

293
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,120
 and we're gonna look at the first six today,

294
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,000
 he wants to reestablish for his church right at the start

295
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,640
 how they should think about themselves and about God.

296
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
 Because he realizes that their identity

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,880
 has been shaken recently.

298
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,720
 You remember last week,

299
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,000
 if you were here as part of our opening message,

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,640
 and if you weren't, I encourage you to go online

301
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,600
 and check it out, but last week,

302
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
 I mentioned two critical things

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
 about the church in Philippi.

304
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,480
 First of all, I told us that they were a church

305
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,240
 under great persecution.

306
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,920
 The gospel of Caesar and the gospel of Jesus had clashed.

307
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,360
 And Paul knew that many of them there were struggling with,

308
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,120
 do I honor Caesar or do I honor God?

309
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,160
 And if those things come into conflict, what do I do?

310
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
 And because of that,

311
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,040
 the church itself had become under persecution.

312
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,320
 There was heavy persecution of the church in Philippi.

313
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
 The second thing about the church there

314
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,120
 is their division amongst themselves.

315
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,080
 I said last week that as the persecution increased,

316
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,880
 the church was beginning to kind of head

317
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,360
 a little bit like this.

318
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
 There were different factions

319
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,440
 that were beginning to grow up in the church,

320
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,600
 different people with different perspectives and opinions,

321
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,800
 and the church was not unified together.

322
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,280
 It was beginning to become more divided.

323
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,960
 And Paul understood as he's writing to the church,

324
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,200
 as he's opening the letter,

325
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,800
 he knows that their identity has been shaken

326
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,360
 by the persecution,

327
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
 as well as by the divisions amongst themselves.

328
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,160
 And he realizes some things need to be uprooted

329
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,640
 and some things need to be firmly established.

330
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 The church needs to understand who they truly are.

331
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,000
 So his opening prayer in the book

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,360
 is a prayer to reestablish the roots of their identity.

333
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,040
 You're with me so far?

334
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,520
 Now, here's why this is important.

335
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,840
 'Cause I don't know about you,

336
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,840
 but I know me and I know that I recognize the inward door

337
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,120
 that I want to open to the Holy Spirit

338
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,080
 like we sung about during our worship time,

339
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,000
 needs to open up

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,440
 because I do recognize some brokenness in me.

341
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,240
 I do recognize some areas where my identity

342
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,320
 is not as it should be.

343
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,840
 And I wonder if that's resonating

344
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,760
 with anyone else in this room.

345
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,200
 And if it is, then my prayer for us,

346
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,600
 as Paul's prayer was for his church,

347
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
 that I pray for you today

348
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
 as we open up this passage of scriptures,

349
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,640
 that God would begin to speak about your identity afresh

350
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,160
 and establish in you some new, wonderful, beautiful things.

351
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,000
 Can we pray?

352
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,880
 Father, I just ask that you would open this word

353
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,200
 to us this morning.

354
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,080
 We thank you that Paul had a passion for the church,

355
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
 passion for his people,

356
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,040
 and that he taught us much about prayer.

357
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
 And as we think about what it is to pray as a church

358
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,280
 together today in our identity in you,

359
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,640
 would you come and speak to us in Jesus' name?

360
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,840
 And we'll say this.

361
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,400
 Let me read to you the first six verses of Philippians.

362
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,000
 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,

363
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,440
 to all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi,

364
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,640
 together with the overseers and the deacons,

365
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,800
 grace and peace to you from our God, the Father,

366
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
 and our Lord Jesus Christ.

367
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
 I thank my God every time I remember you.

368
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,280
 In all my prayers for all of you,

369
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,460
 I always pray with joy

370
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,200
 because of our partnership in the gospel,

371
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,720
 from the first day until now,

372
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,880
 being confident of this,

373
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,280
 that he who began a good work in you

374
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,280
 will carry it on to completion

375
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,840
 until the day of Christ Jesus.

376
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,360
 Paul writes to the church,

377
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,280
 and immediately he wants to,

378
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,880
 after he's introduced himself and he's addressed them

379
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,560
 and said grace and peace over them,

380
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,880
 from verse three and four,

381
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,320
 he immediately brings an intimacy to them in this letter.

382
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 He says, "I thank God for you."

383
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,360
 He says, "I'm always remembering you in my prayers.

384
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,340
 "I pray for all of you.

385
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,240
 "There's a great joy in me as I pray."

386
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,160
 It's like Paul is saying,

387
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,920
 "Man, I am so intimately, personally loving towards you.

388
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,960
 "I mean, I can't help but thank God,

389
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,160
 "rejoice for you, remember you,

390
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,680
 "pray for you all the time."

391
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,440
 Paul is being very intimate and very direct.

392
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,240
 Now, you have to remember,

393
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,160
 Paul is writing this from a place

394
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,760
 of being in chains in prison.

395
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,040
 In other words, Paul is writing this

396
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
 not when everything is going great for Paul.

397
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,980
 And I don't know about you and I,

398
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,640
 but when things are not going great for me

399
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,280
 and somebody says, "What's your prayer life like?"

400
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,840
 I'm like, "Oh man, I need you to pray for me.

401
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,280
 "Things are hard for me.

402
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,520
 "Things are going bad.

403
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,480
 "Oh, I'm in chains for the gospel.

404
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,160
 "Would you pray, church, that God would break the..."

405
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,800
 Paul doesn't do that.

406
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,020
 I want you to see this.

407
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,560
 When he thinks about prayer,

408
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,160
 he thinks about praying for others.

409
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,000
 He writes to them,

410
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,480
 even though he's in a really hard situation,

411
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,880
 and he celebrates, and he says,

412
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,160
 "I'm praying for you always,

413
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,760
 "and I have great joy in my heart.

414
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,200
 "And I just thank God that you're alive

415
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,120
 "and that you're committed

416
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
 "and that you're together in this church."

417
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,240
 And it's a beautiful thing.

418
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,560
 Paul is modeling something for us.

419
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,120
 He's showing the church a new way to pray.

420
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,080
 And I wonder if the Holy Spirit came

421
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,240
 and did an audit of your prayer life,

422
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,600
 what might emerge?

423
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,680
 If you're anything like me,

424
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,080
 your prayer life is probably predominantly about you

425
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,960
 and maybe your immediate family,

426
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,240
 the things that really matter.

427
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,040
 It's like a laundry list of all the stuff

428
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,400
 that you might want God to do in your life.

429
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,840
 Now, don't get me wrong.

430
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,960
 That kind of prayer is great.

431
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
 It's important.

432
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,620
 It's throughout the Bible.

433
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,040
 We should pray for one another.

434
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,400
 We should pray for ourselves.

435
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,840
 That's absolutely fine.

436
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,680
 But Paul is saying,

437
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,240
 if you really truly wanna be the church together,

438
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,400
 you need to shift your prayer life

439
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
 from being just about a laundry list

440
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,920
 of all the things that you want God to do for you

441
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
 and begin to shift it towards what it means

442
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,760
 to actually thank God for one another.

443
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,280
 He's saying, "I don't just do these things for you.

444
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,420
 "I'm modeling how you should be for each other.

445
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,380
 "You should thank God for one another.

446
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,220
 "You should find joy when you think about each other.

447
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,120
 "You should actually want the blessings

448
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,760
 "and the welfare of one another."

449
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,920
 And I think one of the reasons

450
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,960
 why Paul is starting his prayer with this

451
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,640
 is that he's trying to say something to them

452
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,800
 about their division and their disunity.

453
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,680
 Come on, church, note this.

454
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,200
 It's so hard to remain hateful and hardened

455
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,640
 towards those that you genuinely are thanking God for,

456
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,020
 towards those that you genuinely want God

457
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,880
 to give His blessings for their welfare and their growth.

458
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,960
 It's really hard to stay divided to those

459
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,360
 that you genuinely out of joy want the best for them.

460
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,560
 Are you with me?

461
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,440
 But here's a church where they were struggling.

462
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,960
 They were heading in this direction.

463
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,720
 They were probably, it was probably difficult for them

464
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,880
 at times to be in the same room as one another.

465
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,360
 And Paul's saying, "Shift your prayer life

466
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,240
 "away from yourself towards the genuine affection

467
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,160
 "for the other."

468
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,240
 If you wanna break dividing walls,

469
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,320
 move in the opposite spirit

470
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,120
 to what those walls are saying to you.

471
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,400
 Say, "Lord, even though I find this person difficult,

472
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,440
 "Lord, even though they've hurt me,

473
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,860
 "Father, I am so grateful you created them.

474
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,120
 "And I know, Lord, that you're doing something in them.

475
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,000
 "And Father, I pray a blessing over them."

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,920
 Could you imagine how that might revolutionize

477
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,880
 a broken church if people truly prayed that way?

478
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,200
 A few years ago, there was a person here at the Vine

479
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,520
 who caused me a lot of personal anxiety,

480
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,380
 stress, emotional pain.

481
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,840
 And I was walking with this person every season.

482
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,880
 It was incredibly difficult.

483
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
 And I felt a darkness in me towards that person.

484
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,920
 I struggled to be a Christian towards them,

485
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,640
 let alone a pastor towards them.

486
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,480
 Are you with me?

487
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
 And right in the midst of that season,

488
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,480
 God came and said, "Andrew, I want you

489
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,040
 "to thank God for them."

490
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,900
 I'm like, "No way.

491
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,160
 "There's no way I'm gonna thank God for this person.

492
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,540
 "I want to get this person.

493
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,020
 "I wanna do a lot of things for this person,

494
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,240
 "but not to thank you for them."

495
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,800
 He's like, "I want you to thank God for them,

496
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,060
 "and not just thank God for them,

497
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,580
 "but I also want you to pray my blessings over them.

498
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,240
 "I've got so much I wanna do in them,

499
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,540
 "so much I wanna give them.

500
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,320
 "Would you partner with me in praying thanksgiving

501
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,720
 "and blessing over them?"

502
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,780
 And I tell you, it was not easy.

503
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,880
 I rebelled against the obedience instruction

504
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,940
 of the Lord many times in that area.

505
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,040
 But as I began to say, "Lord, okay, Lord,"

506
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,460
 day one, it was like, "Lord, thank you for them.

507
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,300
 "Just bless them."

508
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,120
 (congregation laughing)

509
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,300
 Day two was better.

510
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,400
 Day three, day five, day 20,

511
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,560
 "Lord, I sense something in my spirit for them."

512
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,600
 And I began to pray almost daily for this person,

513
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,800
 and I felt something happen in me.

514
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,880
 I don't know whatever happened in them,

515
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,080
 but I know something happened in me.

516
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,720
 You know sometimes when God moves mountains,

517
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,080
 they're not in the people we're praying for.

518
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,880
 They're actually moved in us.

519
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,200
 And I felt like this shift and this change in who I was,

520
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,080
 and I felt myself more gracious and loving and kind.

521
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,840
 And my interactions with this person also changed,

522
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,200
 because not because, again, they changed particularly

523
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,080
 or the situation changed particularly,

524
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,220
 but because something inside of me shifted.

525
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,800
 A dividing wall came down because I was thankful

526
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,000
 and I was seeking the welfare of the one

527
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,700
 that I was at amnesty against.

528
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,680
 Are you with me?

529
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,040
 You do this, and it's a supernatural,

530
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,720
 prophetic breaking down of the walls.

531
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,280
 Oh, what church might look like if it did more of that.

532
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,520
 Paul then goes on in verse five, and he says,

533
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,080
 "Because you are partnering together."

534
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,640
 I thank God for our partnership in the gospel.

535
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,920
 This is a beautiful word, this partnership.

536
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,720
 In the Greek, it's the same root word as koinonia,

537
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,560
 which is fellowship.

538
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,480
 This is Paul saying about fellowship,

539
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,760
 but this particular word actually emphasizes more

540
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,320
 the working together with another, which is amazing,

541
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,200
 'cause Paul's essentially saying that true fellowship,

542
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,440
 true koinonia is not just meeting together,

543
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,780
 it is also working together.

544
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,520
 That actually committing ourselves to work together

545
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,800
 towards a shared vision is as much on God's heart

546
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,400
 when he talks about fellowship as it is for us

547
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,280
 just to come together and know each other

548
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,680
 and enjoy being in relationship with one another.

549
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,640
 So Paul, fellowship, meeting, also had a purpose.

550
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,000
 And remember, Paul is saying there's a partnership

551
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,160
 we take place with in the gospel,

552
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,640
 and he's thanking them for their partnership

553
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,740
 because they as a church had partnered with him

554
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,880
 in his gospel.

555
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,140
 They had actually financially provided for him.

556
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,120
 They had sent this guy, one of the leaders from the church

557
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,440
 called Ephroditus, to come and minister to him

558
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,240
 whilst he was in prison.

559
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,080
 The church in Philippi had been very generous towards Paul.

560
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,400
 He says, "There's a partnership that's happening here."

561
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,680
 But he's not just thanking them for the finance

562
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,120
 and for the material support he had received.

563
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,280
 He's again, modeling what prayer might look like.

564
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,760
 And he's like, "Here's how you pray for one another,

565
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,700
 "that you're not just thankful for each other.

566
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,920
 "You're not just wanting the best

567
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,400
 "and pray blessing on each other,

568
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,020
 "but there is a prayer that you would work well together

569
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,720
 "for the gospel."

570
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,600
 Because there is something that the gospel

571
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,120
 is trying to do in this time.

572
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,240
 There's a work of the gospel, God's spirit and presence.

573
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,680
 This is an alternative society planted in the wider society.

574
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,360
 You're not just a holy huddle on a Sunday,

575
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,040
 Paul is saying to the church.

576
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,160
 When you come together, it's also not just to meet together,

577
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,000
 but it's to roll up your sleeves and say,

578
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,960
 "What is it that we are to do together

579
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,080
 "with a shared vision and a shared passion

580
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
 "for the gospel in our city?"

581
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,480
 'Cause there's lots of people out there

582
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,920
 that need to know Jesus.

583
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,580
 And if all we ever do under these beautiful lights

584
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,880
 and in this beautiful building is to sing praise songs,

585
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
 but we never actually then go out

586
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,360
 and reach out with the gospel,

587
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,480
 Paul would say, "That's not fellowship."

588
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,400
 This is an important word for us

589
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
 in our time here in Hong Kong in this season.

590
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,960
 'Cause I don't know about you, man,

591
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,360
 but I love the church, right?

592
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,040
 It's kind of my job, but I love it, I really do.

593
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,720
 And I have survived in the last two, three years

594
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,880
 here in Hong Kong because I get to come

595
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,520
 and do this with you.

596
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,400
 I mean, the times of restoration and healing,

597
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,560
 times where the week has been so hard for me

598
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,320
 that I just fall over the precipice

599
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,520
 of the door on the Sunday.

600
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,240
 And I'm like, "Thank God I can shut the world out

601
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,480
 "for 90 minutes and just spend time

602
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,200
 "with people I love."

603
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,400
 Right, are you with me?

604
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,160
 Like, it's great that the church

605
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,960
 is a healing hospital for us.

606
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,520
 It's great that the church is available for us in that way.

607
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,920
 It should be always that way.

608
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,100
 But here's the problem.

609
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,040
 In times of persecution, in times of hardship,

610
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,140
 in times of suffering, it's very easy for the church

611
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,440
 to be tempted to only fellowship in meeting together

612
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,600
 and completely forget about the outreach

613
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,160
 that it has been called to do.

614
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,040
 You see, in hard and overwhelming times,

615
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
 for a church, we must remember that the church

616
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,760
 is not just a place to meet together.

617
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,560
 It's not just a place of respite.

618
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,260
 It is also a place of outreach.

619
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,920
 Are you with me, everyone?

620
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,480
 And as we button that down in our thinking

621
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,820
 and in our identity, when we pray thanksgiving

622
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,320
 for one another, when we pray a blessing over one another,

623
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,180
 it's not just so that we can have reconciled relationships

624
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,900
 in this space right now.

625
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,140
 It's so that in partnership together,

626
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,500
 we can work better together.

627
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,460
 You see, Paul wants them reconciled.

628
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,420
 He wants their dividing walls broken down,

629
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,260
 not just so that they can hug each other more,

630
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,760
 but so that they can be a more effective witness

631
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,740
 of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ

632
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,660
 in society around them.

633
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,120
 Because if the world looks in on the messiness of this

634
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,560
 with all our cultures and backgrounds

635
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,620
 and all the fact that we have different political views

636
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,800
 and all of those things, if the world looks in on this

637
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,080
 and sees us loving each other, working together,

638
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,560
 praying together, breaking down dividing walls,

639
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,560
 and then actually as one unit moving out

640
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,120
 with hope and joy to the world,

641
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,240
 the world will see that and go, "That's different."

642
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,000
 There's something tremendously exciting in that.

643
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,340
 So Paul invites the church to also pray

644
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,300
 about their partnership with one another in the gospel.

645
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,820
 Could you imagine what it would be like to be a church

646
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,800
 that prayed like that?

647
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,340
 Now, we get to the really meaty part,

648
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,740
 the bit that I'm really excited about.

649
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,580
 Are you ready?

650
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,660
 Verse six, he says this, "Being confident of this,

651
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,020
 that he who began a good work in you

652
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,180
 will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus."

653
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,560
 This is Paul shifting now to talk about their identity

654
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,280
 and the reality that their identity was being shaken.

655
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,200
 And he wants to speak into the very root of who they are

656
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,360
 and the very root of the kind of God

657
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,240
 that they should believe in.

658
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,000
 Let me preach on this for a second by framing it like this.

659
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,080
 I think we're living in a time and in a society

660
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
 and a community right now in the world

661
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,160
 that has major commitment issues.

662
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,120
 I don't know if you've felt like this yourself,

663
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,840
 but I think we're living in a time

664
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,980
 where we're so used to scrolling so quickly

665
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,860
 through social media onto the next fix,

666
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,980
 onto the next fix, the next video, the next photo,

667
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,220
 the next thing that's happening,

668
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,780
 that we're beginning to take that

669
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,000
 and applying it into the jobs that we have,

670
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,260
 the relationships that we have, the marriages that we have.

671
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,780
 And we're becoming a society

672
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,940
 that is letting go of commitment,

673
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,380
 letting go of standing on our word.

674
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,660
 And actually our own personal selfish desires

675
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,740
 are taking precedent over the word

676
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,680
 that we might've given to someone.

677
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,180
 Because we're so used to finding the next thing

678
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:38,500
 that satisfies that we now, even in our external world,

679
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,900
 are desperately often looking for the next thing

680
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,740
 that satisfies.

681
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,460
 And when we're in a relationship,

682
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,420
 when we're in a workplace and things get a little tense,

683
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,500
 things get a little difficult,

684
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,980
 maybe there's a little bump in the road,

685
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,540
 we're very quick at the moment

686
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,420
 to just let go of that thing and move on to the next thing.

687
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,620
 See, we have a commitment issue, I believe,

688
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,900
 because we have a perspective issue.

689
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,000
 You see, we're so quick to give up on something

690
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,260
 because we so often judge that thing

691
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:11,260
 based on its present reality rather than its future finish.

692
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,620
 We judge it on all of the stuff

693
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,940
 that's happening in that moment

694
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,460
 rather than being able to stand back

695
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,700
 and see that there's a trajectory of this thing

696
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,060
 that is actually going somewhere else.

697
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,620
 We judge one another

698
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,680
 because of the place in the journey that we're in

699
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,980
 rather than actually looking

700
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,620
 that we're actually on a journey.

701
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,260
 We judge each other by what we see in front of us

702
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,380
 rather than in the grander picture

703
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,860
 of what the Holy Spirit might be doing within us.

704
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,180
 And when that happens,

705
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,940
 we find ourselves letting go of our commitments,

706
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,460
 just giving up on stuff just quickly.

707
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,980
 And I think one of the reasons we do it

708
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,480
 is because we wanna avoid suffering and hardship.

709
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,780
 Like if this thing we're doing right here,

710
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,000
 if that's gonna be hard, man,

711
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,220
 I don't know if I want anything hard.

712
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,560
 It's already hard enough to live.

713
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,240
 I don't know if I want extra hardness.

714
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,020
 I'm just gonna let that one go.

715
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,300
 And I think as Christians,

716
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,440
 we have a real dangerous thing that we do.

717
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,700
 I think we actually over-spiritualize things sometimes.

718
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,020
 And we kind of go, "Man, I got into this

719
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,540
 'cause I thought God called me into it.

720
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,620
 And oh yeah, he gave me those confirming signs

721
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,860
 and those confirming words.

722
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,420
 And I started it, but you know, it got really hard.

723
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,700
 And I realized that it was hard

724
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,400
 because God wasn't in it anymore."

725
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,340
 And we suddenly over-spiritualize our struggles

726
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,580
 and our suffering with the reality

727
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,940
 that God must not be there.

728
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,060
 God's lifted His grace.

729
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,500
 God's not involved in this anymore.

730
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,980
 So, "Well, I'll go and do the next thing."

731
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,500
 When actually God's word is firm and true.

732
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,860
 He's a faithful God.

733
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,420
 So Paul writes to the church,

734
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,020
 a church that I think was deeply struggling with this,

735
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,380
 and he begins to speak into them.

736
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,420
 He says, "Don't judge something

737
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,500
 on what it looks like right now.

738
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,340
 You need to realize that the Holy Spirit

739
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,500
 is moving everything towards this glorious day

740
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,100
 when Christ will return.

741
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,940
 And if God started it,

742
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,700
 He will be in it and He will complete it."

743
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,540
 Let me give you a sense of this by showing you a photograph.

744
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,540
 This photograph was taken on the 23rd of December, 1997.

745
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,980
 That's me, by the way, in the photograph.

746
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,780
 Can you see the long hair?

747
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,860
 Look at this, long hair.

748
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,660
 I don't know what my sideburns are doing,

749
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,060
 but they're getting real long there.

750
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,700
 Those glasses, I think I might've borrowed them from my dad.

751
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,540
 I don't know.

752
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,620
 Those glasses are not cool.

753
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,120
 I'm wearing this really baggy suit.

754
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,180
 This is like '90s ugliness right there on a photo for you.

755
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,100
 Here's the thing.

756
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,360
 This is my engagement night.

757
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,100
 And I am so, so glad that my wife, Christine,

758
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,580
 did not decide to answer my question to her,

759
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,860
 "Will you marry me?"

760
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,580
 based on how I looked in that moment.

761
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,340
 I am so glad that she saw

762
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,740
 that there was a better future ahead

763
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,100
 than what was happening right now.

764
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,900
 I'm so glad that she knew I was like a fine wine,

765
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,140
 that I would get better ahead.

766
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,200
 I'm so glad that she didn't look at that hair

767
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
 and look at those sideburns,

768
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,020
 but she looked at the character

769
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,780
 and the integrity and the future.

770
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,420
 And she said, "I wanna be a part of that

771
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,340
 "because the trajectory where it's going is good,

772
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,940
 "even if right now you look like this."

773
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,220
 (congregation laughing)

774
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,860
 And I think God is, through Paul speaking to the church

775
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,440
 in Philippi, a church under great persecution,

776
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,100
 a church under division within them.

777
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,660
 And Paul understands that if we're giving up on one another,

778
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,860
 the next phase is that we start to give up on God.

779
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,300
 And so when God doesn't answer that prayer

780
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,180
 in the time we thought, he's not faithful.

781
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,500
 When God doesn't act in the way we want him to do,

782
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,860
 I guess he's not faithful.

783
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,780
 I think the church in Philippi was looking at Paul

784
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,560
 and they were seeing that the one that they loved,

785
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,060
 their mentor, their pastor,

786
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,580
 the one that was so much more spiritual than they'll ever be,

787
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,620
 he was in prison.

788
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,380
 And they're thinking, "If that's my future in the gospel,

789
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,340
 "I don't know if this thing was such a great idea."

790
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,060
 And Paul writes them and he says,

791
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,200
 "This is where our confidence is.

792
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
 "This is where our identity gets formed.

793
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,140
 "This is in who we are."

794
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,100
 We do not judge based on what we see right now.

795
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,900
 We do not allow the persecution.

796
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,220
 We do not allow the division

797
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,300
 to begin to define who we are right now.

798
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,520
 Instead, we recognize that if God started this

799
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,220
 in the beginning, if his presence, if he planted it,

800
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,700
 if he renewed it, if he was the one who spoke into it,

801
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
 then no matter what might happen,

802
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,020
 God will carry it through

803
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,140
 on order so that it would be completed

804
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,140
 on the day of his glorious return.

805
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,060
 He jumps forward to what he's gonna say in verse 10,

806
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,140
 where he says, "On that day,

807
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,860
 "we will be pure and blameless before the Lord."

808
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,260
 And he's saying, "Get a pure and blameless future vision

809
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,500
 "for the brokenness of the current."

810
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,820
 That's how you should pray.

811
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,220
 We should be able to give each other much more grace,

812
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,100
 give each other much more release

813
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,380
 than the reality of what we're seeing.

814
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,580
 He said, "There's a good work in you."

815
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,460
 Don't forget it.

816
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,700
 No matter how hard the situation might be,

817
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,620
 there's a good work in you.

818
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,820
 When Paul speaks of good works,

819
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,540
 he's speaking here predominantly of two things,

820
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,820
 the good work of their conversion

821
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,740
 through the Holy Spirit in Jesus, the gospel.

822
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,940
 He's speaking about that moment

823
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,820
 when they gave their life to Jesus.

824
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,140
 He said, "That moment didn't happen because you did it.

825
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,860
 "It happened because God started it in you.

826
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,860
 "It's a good work."

827
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,740
 And then he's talking about

828
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,380
 the ongoing sanctification process

829
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,780
 that would lead them to the time when Jesus comes back,

830
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,620
 this ongoing work of renewal where we give up our spirit,

831
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,980
 we give our sin to Him, we repent and we come before Him,

832
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,500
 and we do all of that kind of work.

833
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,100
 All of that is part of this other good work

834
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,620
 that He sustains in us as He brings us to the time

835
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,860
 when He'll return to judge the world

836
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,900
 and we will be before Him in a place of pureness

837
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,740
 and blamelessness, and it's wonderful.

838
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,580
 And Paul's saying, "Get this perspective

839
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,340
 "when you pray, it's a good work."

840
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,820
 Notice, he doesn't say it's an easy work.

841
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,140
 Doesn't say even it's a fun work.

842
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,340
 Doesn't even say it's a work that's going to be a blessing

843
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,060
 to all your needs and your wants and your desires.

844
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,260
 But he says it's an eternal work of good in you.

845
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,020
 And that good work sometimes requires hard work on our part.

846
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,940
 It sometimes requires repentance

847
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,500
 as much as it requires prayers for blessing.

848
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,060
 Sometimes requires us to give up things

849
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,540
 rather than hold on to the broken.

850
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,780
 Sometimes it requires us to have that conversation,

851
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,300
 to humble ourselves, to say, "Will you forgive me?"

852
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,060
 Sometimes the work that is good in God's eyes

853
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,140
 requires something that might be tough in ours.

854
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,260
 But just 'cause it's tough doesn't mean God has given up.

855
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,820
 That's what He's saying to the church.

856
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,540
 It might be hard at times, but it's a good work.

857
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,580
 And here's the thing.

858
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,580
 If God started it, you can take two things to the bank.

859
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,140
 It's a good work and it will be completed.

860
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,620
 Imagine what it would mean to pray like that.

861
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,380
 Which is exactly why Paul then brings it

862
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,860
 all the way back to what he started with,

863
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,660
 division amongst them.

864
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,140
 And he says, "Man, if God starts it,

865
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,100
 if God's gonna be there every step of the way,

866
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,140
 if God's gonna complete it,

867
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,540
 then you need to get that prayerful perspective in your mind

868
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,300
 as you are trying to be the body of Christ together."

869
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,300
 See, this is me, not Paul.

870
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,700
 But I think there is so much division

871
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,980
 and disunity in the church

872
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,540
 because we have a tendency in us to judge one another,

873
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,460
 not on the confidence of how we're going to appear

874
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,800
 on that glorious day when Christ returns,

875
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,860
 but on the reality of our human brokenness

876
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,500
 in the present along the way.

877
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,540
 That's what we judge.

878
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,820
 We look upon one another and we hurt one another

879
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,980
 and we do things and we're sinful as human beings

880
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,100
 and we look at that and we say,

881
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,780
 "That person's never gonna amount to anything.

882
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,620
 I don't even know if that person's a Christian."

883
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,220
 And we judge one another.

884
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,740
 And that judgment of our present reality of our sin

885
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,500
 is what causes the deeper divisions amongst us.

886
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,540
 And Paul says, "You wanna know how to pray.

887
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,820
 Pray that you are thankful for every person

888
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,220
 within your community of faith.

889
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,980
 Pray that God will bless each person.

890
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,820
 Pray that you'll be able to partner better for the gospel,

891
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,820
 being confident of this,

892
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,180
 that if God has started a good work in that person,

893
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,420
 if God has their hand on them,

894
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,660
 then he will be with them every step of the way.

895
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,140
 And they're not gonna look perfect.

896
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,500
 They're still gonna upset you.

897
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,520
 They're gonna do things that are gonna hurt you,

898
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,540
 but he is in it.

899
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,580
 He will bring them to a place of pureness and blamelessness

900
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,220
 on the return of Christ Jesus.

901
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,020
 It is not your place to judge.

902
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,300
 It is your place to love."

903
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,580
 That's what church looks like, Paul is saying.

904
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,020
 You wanna know how to pray?

905
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,140
 Pray like that.

906
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,380
 Ain't that beautiful?

907
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,580
 And as we lean into praying like that,

908
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:44,420
 we might then begin to have this release in us

909
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,620
 that we are actually an alternative society

910
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,940
 that doesn't just say it loves, but truly does.

911
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,060
 It doesn't just say that we like to come together,

912
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,500
 but we truly do love to come together.

913
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,580
 It doesn't just say that we're working together

914
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,420
 for the gospel,

915
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,740
 but we're actually working together for the gospel.

916
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,260
 'Cause our identity is not rooted in our situation.

917
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,940
 It's not rooted in the suffering.

918
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,500
 It's not rooted in the things that are happening to us

919
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,020
 and those things causing us like that moment for me to go,

920
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,060
 am I really that person?

921
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:15,620
 Instead, our identity is rooted on a God.

922
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,500
 We are confident of this God,

923
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,620
 that if he starts it, it's good, and he will finish it.

924
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,460
 In Jesus' name.

925
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,300
 - Amen.

926
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,140
 - Amen.

927
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,960
 Can we stand together?

928
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,980
 I wanna read a prayer over us.

929
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,500
 We're gonna read it together actually.

930
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,060
 And it's a prayer that this passage leads us to.

931
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,780
 If this was not COVID times,

932
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,020
 I would have us holding hands, linking arms,

933
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,580
 but the introverts in the room are very happy

934
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,400
 that this is COVID.

935
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,260
 So we're gonna read this out loud together

936
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,340
 as our prayer as a congregation.

937
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,180
 So let's read it together.

938
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,180
 Dear Lord Jesus, we thank you.

939
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,180
 We are a part of your family together.

940
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,780
 We thank you for this church and for our fellowship.

941
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,980
 We thank you for your faithfulness and love.

942
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,280
 We pray for each other now.

943
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,780
 May we find joy in each other.

944
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,180
 May we find gospel partnership in each other.

945
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,840
 May we carry each other in our hearts

946
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,780
 and share God's grace with each other.

947
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,540
 May we be quick to love and slow to judge.

948
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,640
 May we know the affection of Jesus Christ

949
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,000
 and his joy for one another.

950
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,620
 And through this all, may we grow together,

951
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,100
 being confident that he who began a good work in us

952
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,800
 will carry it on to completion.

953
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,540
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

954
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,700
 Father, we just come before you now,

955
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,420
 grateful for this type of church

956
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,700
 that you're building amongst us,

957
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,660
 an alternative society that prays in new ways.

958
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,220
 Father, we don't just look at the church in Philippi

959
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,220
 as a divided church.

960
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,000
 We recognize so often the enemy gets into our churches today,

961
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,460
 gets into this church, creates division and disunity.

962
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,060
 Lord, that breaks our hearts.

963
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,900
 And Father, we recognize that that doesn't just happen here,

964
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,220
 but it also happens in the wider spheres of our lives

965
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:10,180
 with relationships and families and colleagues.

966
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:15,020
 I wanna just take a moment as we respond now in ministry

967
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,820
 to let the Holy Spirit speak to you.

968
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:20,020
 Perhaps there's some relationships in your lives.

969
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,060
 Perhaps there's some things

970
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,220
 that you've got a commitment issue towards.

971
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,020
 Maybe you're looking for the next great thing

972
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,100
 and the Holy Spirit's saying, "I started that."

973
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,340
 And it might not guarantee that it'll be easy,

974
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,900
 but it is good and it will be completed in you.

975
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,340
 And so some of you, maybe it's the Holy Spirit

976
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:44,100
 just promptly and soberly just tugging on your heart today

977
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,980
 to reestablish your commitment to what He's called you to.

978
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,460
 Perhaps there's some of you in this room

979
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,260
 where you know that there's brokenness

980
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,140
 between you and others.

981
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,060
 Maybe that's a brokenness that you've created and sustained

982
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,140
 or maybe it's been created and sustained towards you.

983
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,500
 If it's happened towards you, I wanna encourage you

984
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,020
 to maybe pray a new way as you go forward,

985
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,460
 to pray that prayer of thankfulness

986
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,100
 and blessing for that person.

987
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,620
 It's not gonna be easy for you,

988
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,460
 but it is an invitation to open the door inwards,

989
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,300
 allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you in that

990
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
 as you spiritually and supernaturally

991
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,420
 walk in the opposite spirit.

992
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,980
 And if you're the one that's perhaps caused that pain

993
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,060
 or that division outwardly,

994
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,660
 then today's a chance just to come

995
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,300
 and ask the Holy Spirit to minister to you too.

996
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,980
 Just to bring your heart before Him

997
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,740
 and ask Him to forgive you,

998
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,980
 ask Him to show how you can make reconciliation

999
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,020
 for that person, what it might be

1000
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,100
 that you're being called to do

1001
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,260
 by the power of the Holy Spirit

1002
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,420
 in the weeks and the months ahead.

1003
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,140
 Lord, however you need us to respond this morning,

1004
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,900
 would you come by your Holy Spirit?

1005
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,480
 (gentle music)

1006
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,060
 (gentle music)
