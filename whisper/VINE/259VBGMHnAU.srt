1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 I have a question for you all.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,280
 Who here, by show of hands please,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,880
 who here watches Netflix?

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,840
 Okay, great.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,800
 So my husband and I love a good show,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,680
 and as new parents, we're not really able to watch

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,720
 as we used to, but when we get those little moments,

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,960
 and we get the chance to just sit down and unwind,

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,960
 we really love a good British limited series.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,960
 Yeah, right?

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 They're usually really short,

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
 they're jam-packed with cliffhangers, amazing storylines,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,520
 and they sort of leave you at the edge of your seat,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,400
 like, what's gonna happen next?

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,080
 What's gonna happen to this person?

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,720
 But at the end of the series,

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,640
 there's always a bit of a sigh,

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,760
 and that's just it, it's over.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,480
 And now funnily enough, there's a little series

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,840
 or a two-parter in the Bible,

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,760
 and we've been looking at part one of it

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,520
 for the last few weeks.

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,320
 It's written by Luke, both the Book of Luke and Acts

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,360
 are part of the same series, and they're both about Jesus.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,600
 And trust me, it's more than your average Netflix show.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,120
 Part one, the Book of Luke, as you may have noticed,

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,200
 speaks about the anticipation of the coming Christ,

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
 his birth, his miracles, his death, and his resurrection.

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,560
 And it's all from eyewitness accounts.

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,240
 Part two in the Book of Acts is what happens

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,000
 after Jesus ascends into heaven,

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,480
 the Holy Spirit overtakes, and how the word of God,

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,480
 the gospel, spreads from Jerusalem to the rest of the world.

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,600
 And trust me, if you've read Acts,

35
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,200
 you know there's no shortage of extraordinary miracles

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,880
 and a show of the power of God.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
 Now, I mentioned Netflix earlier

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,440
 because there's often the temptation

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,600
 to look at the Bible the same way we look at a film

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
 or a series.

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,160
 It's entertaining whilst we're watching it,

42
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,160
 like in the moment, and maybe you talk about it

43
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,160
 a little bit afterwards, but it fades very, very quickly.

44
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,200
 It's like it fades into the box of memories

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,680
 of many, many other films that you've seen

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,160
 and that you've watched.

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,400
 So as we continue to look through Luke today,

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,600
 I wanna challenge us not to do the same thing.

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,520
 Let's not look at the word of God

50
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,320
 like we do a film or a show on Netflix,

51
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,480
 where we're engaged in the moment

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,640
 and then we forget all about it as soon as we finish,

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
 where we don't apply what we've read into our own lives

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,400
 and we make the mistake of looking at the Bible

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,720
 as some sort of fictional story.

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,720
 The word of God is true.

57
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,800
 The word of God is life-changing,

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,600
 and it should be read with the expectation

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,080
 that every time we open it, God has something to say

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,480
 and he wants to meet with us.

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,000
 So have this in mind as we look at the text today.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
 The word of God is true.

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,280
 The word of God changes lives.

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,520
 It always, always, always, always brings freedom,

65
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,640
 and it goes far beyond us.

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,880
 It never returns to him void.

67
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,360
 Last week, Chapman took us through Mary's song,

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,280
 and today we're gonna take a look at Zechariah's song.

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,360
 I'm gonna read a little bit before that

70
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,560
 so we get a better picture of what has happened

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
 and what brings him to actually sing.

72
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,080
 It's quite a long one,

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,360
 but I do think it's important to read the whole thing

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,240
 so then we can dive into it a little bit deeper.

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,240
 So it's in Luke 1, verse 57 to 80, and it reads,

76
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,040
 "When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby,

77
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,240
 "she gave birth to a son.

78
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,880
 "Her neighbors and relatives heard

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,640
 "that the Lord had shown her great mercy,

80
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,800
 "and they shared her joy.

81
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,360
 "On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child,

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,800
 "and they were going to name him

83
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,040
 "after his father, Zechariah.

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,760
 "But his mother spoke up and said,

85
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,600
 "'No, he is to be called John.'

86
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,640
 "They said to her,

87
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,120
 "'There is no one among your relatives who has that name.'

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,320
 "Then they made signs to his father

89
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,120
 "to find out what he would like to name the child.

90
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,400
 "He asked for a writing tablet,

91
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,500
 "and to everyone's astonishment, he wrote,

92
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,040
 "'His name is John.'

93
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,280
 "Immediately, his mouth was opened and his tongue set free,

94
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,040
 "and he began to speak, praising God.

95
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,120
 "All the neighbors were filled with awe,

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,960
 "and throughout the hill country and Judea,

97
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,360
 "people were talking about all these things.

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,720
 "Everyone who had heard this wondered about it,

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,420
 "asking, 'What then is this child going to be?'

100
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,220
 "For the Lord's hand was with him."

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,760
 Verse 67, now we're getting into the song.

102
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,960
 His father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,620
 and prophesied, "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,

104
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,140
 "because he has come to his people and redeemed them.

105
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,680
 "He has raised up a horn of salvation for us

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,840
 "in the house of his servant David,

107
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,780
 "as he said through his holy prophets long ago,

108
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,460
 "salvation from our enemies and from the hand

109
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,100
 "of all who hate us, to show mercy to our ancestors

110
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,700
 "and to remember his holy covenant.

111
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,360
 "The oath he swore to our father Abraham,

112
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
 "to rescue us from the hand of our enemies

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,900
 "and to enable us to serve him without fear,

114
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,940
 "in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

115
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,060
 "And you, my child, will be called a prophet

116
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,360
 "of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord

117
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,220
 "to prepare the way for him, to give his people

118
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,840
 "the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness

119
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,700
 "of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God,

120
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,940
 "by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven,

121
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,480
 "to shine on those living in darkness

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,140
 "and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet

123
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,960
 "into the path of peace."

124
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,140
 And the child grew and became strong in spirit,

125
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,860
 and he lived in the wilderness

126
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,220
 until he appeared publicly to Israel.

127
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,040
 Amen.

128
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,300
 So, from this verses, it's really clear to see

129
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,780
 that God is at work.

130
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,100
 A few weeks ago, we saw Mary's encounter with the angel,

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,780
 and we also saw Zechariah's, all within the same time

132
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,420
 period, not centuries apart.

133
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,620
 And we also saw how they both responded.

134
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,220
 Mary welcomed the word of the Lord,

135
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,220
 I am your servant, while Zechariah doubted,

136
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,540
 how can I be sure of this?

137
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,720
 His doubt actually echoes another story

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,880
 in the Old Testament.

139
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,200
 It's quite similar to this one, in terms of barrenness

140
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,880
 and waiting on the Lord.

141
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,120
 We read in Genesis 18, that Sarah had a similar reaction

142
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,080
 when she heard that she would have a child in her old age.

143
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,200
 In fact, she thought it was so ridiculous that she laughed.

144
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,880
 Now, can you imagine your grandma,

145
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,080
 actually, your great grandma, telling you she's pregnant,

146
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,500
 she's about to have a baby?

147
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
 [laughing]

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,760
 You would probably laugh and think it was a joke, too.

149
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,680
 But the Lord says to Abraham, in verse 14,

150
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,960
 is anything too hard for the Lord?

151
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,680
 Sarah was past childbearing age,

152
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,280
 and it really didn't seem like a feasible task.

153
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,200
 But this was a reminder that if God says it,

154
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,860
 he can and he will do it.

155
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,480
 Nothing is impossible for God,

156
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,600
 which is the same message that we get here in Luke

157
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,520
 and in many other parts of the Bible.

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,760
 So this was said by the angel to Elizabeth.

159
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,760
 For no word from God will ever fail.

160
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,740
 Even Elizabeth, your relative,

161
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,600
 is going to have a child in her old age,

162
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,580
 and she who was said to be unable to conceive

163
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,140
 is in her sixth month.

164
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,240
 I'll say it again.

165
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,440
 For no word from God will ever fail.

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,760
 And in the book of Isaiah, this is from the Lord himself.

167
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,160
 So it is my word that goes out from my mouth.

168
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
 It will not return to me empty,

169
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,040
 but will accomplish what I desire

170
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,480
 and achieve the purpose for which I have sent it.

171
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,600
 Once he has spoken, we can be sure that he will fulfill it,

172
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,320
 and ultimately, everything is fulfilled

173
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,320
 in the person of Jesus.

174
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,720
 Now, a few weeks back,

175
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,320
 we saw how Zechariah's mouth was actually muted.

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,880
 He doubted the word of the Lord

177
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,000
 that was spoken to him by the angel,

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
 and then he was unable to speak

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,760
 until after his son was born.

180
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
 But even in his silence,

181
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,880
 he was able to declare that which God had already spoken.

182
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,480
 As baby John was getting circumcised,

183
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,960
 eight days after his birth,

184
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,560
 he was asked what the child's name was,

185
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,940
 and instead of what was common practice,

186
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,080
 naming the child after a relative,

187
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,680
 he broke the mold and did something very different.

188
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,000
 He chose in that moment to walk in obedience

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,720
 and follow the instructions that were given to him

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,080
 by the angel.

191
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,240
 And though he doubted at the beginning, he did,

192
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,560
 he also saw God's word come to pass.

193
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,960
 He saw that, indeed, Elizabeth became pregnant.

194
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,680
 He saw that she had given birth to their son,

195
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,960
 and that their old age meant nothing

196
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,480
 because God had said it, and the miracle was done.

197
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,280
 Just as it was done for Abraham centuries before,

198
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,120
 God was doing it again,

199
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,440
 and now all eyes were on Zechariah.

200
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,240
 What are you going to name this boy?

201
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,320
 And Zechariah decided to follow what the Lord had said,

202
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,320
 and as soon as he wrote down his name as John,

203
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,140
 it says, immediately, his mouth was opened

204
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,000
 and his tongue set free,

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,980
 and he began to speak, praising God.

206
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,980
 Now, declaring the word of the Lord brings freedom.

207
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,120
 In Zechariah's case, it was freedom of his tongue

208
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,800
 and having the ability to speak again.

209
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,020
 We also see God's word bringing freedom

210
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,940
 to the children of Israel in the book of Exodus.

211
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,860
 The Israelites were slaves in Egypt

212
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,800
 and longed for their freedom,

213
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,100
 and as Moses continually spoke to Pharaoh,

214
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,580
 declaring God's words,

215
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,340
 let my people go so they may worship me,

216
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,460
 the power of God broke through,

217
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,780
 and the Israelites were set free.

218
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,860
 When we speak God's word, his truth,

219
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,220
 into situations, there is always freedom,

220
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,820
 whether it be physical freedom,

221
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,740
 spiritual, or freedom from sin.

222
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,960
 Now, if you're an old man,

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,620
 you've got no children,

224
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,640
 you've been praying and waiting for decades,

225
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,860
 probably going to the temple on a regular basis

226
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,740
 and just waiting on God.

227
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,440
 We know that being childless was looked down upon

228
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,580
 because we see Elizabeth's words in verse 25.

229
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,380
 He has shown me favor

230
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,380
 and taken away my disgrace among the people.

231
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,260
 And it finally happens.

232
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,140
 The Lord does this great thing,

233
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,180
 and after months of not being able to speak,

234
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,940
 what would be the first words out of your mouth?

235
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,940
 I know for me, I might be a little bit sour at first.

236
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,980
 Not being able to speak for all that time

237
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,900
 throughout the pregnancy of our first child,

238
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
 there must have been so many moments

239
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,220
 that he wanted to just exclaim,

240
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,540
 you know, feeling that first kick, all sorts of things.

241
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,140
 Or maybe just so excited about this miracle

242
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,660
 that I'd be so obsessed with my baby,

243
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,140
 which is often the case,

244
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,940
 and the prayers and the praise to God comes later.

245
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,060
 But Zechariah doesn't speak about John.

246
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,100
 He doesn't even speak about his wife,

247
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,900
 but immediately praises God.

248
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,960
 And what follows is incredible.

249
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,940
 His father, Zechariah,

250
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,220
 was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied.

251
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,900
 And to prophesy is to speak about things that are to come.

252
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,060
 So events that haven't happened,

253
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,580
 but certainly will in the future.

254
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,420
 It's not fortune telling.

255
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,440
 It's none of this weird new age stuff

256
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,060
 that you hear about today.

257
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,620
 No tarot cards, no odd practices.

258
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,340
 It's nothing to do with our own strength.

259
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,820
 It's always, prophecies that come from God are always true,

260
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,660
 and they always happen at their appointed time.

261
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,880
 And at this time,

262
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,500
 the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen on all men.

263
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,140
 So there are moments throughout the Old Testament

264
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,020
 where you see people are overpowered,

265
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,980
 empowered by the Holy Spirit to do something or to speak.

266
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,620
 But we need to be aware

267
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,080
 that it isn't like what we experience today,

268
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,980
 where we can lay hands on each other

269
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,960
 and ask for a filling of the Holy Spirit.

270
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,580
 This was something that came much later.

271
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,260
 And there's a prophecy in Joel

272
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,100
 that speaks about these days,

273
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,380
 the days that we are actually living in today.

274
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,020
 What a privilege.

275
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,460
 So what we read in Luke

276
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,000
 is actually an anticipation of what is to come.

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,620
 It's little glimpses of the power of the Holy Spirit.

278
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,380
 The angel said John would be filled with the Holy Spirit

279
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,100
 even before his birth.

280
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,180
 And we see that Elizabeth gets filled

281
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,500
 with the Holy Spirit in verse 41.

282
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
 And now, Zechariah.

283
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,500
 We know today that the filling of the Spirit

284
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,700
 often accompanies a great move of God.

285
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,540
 In the book of Acts 2,

286
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,360
 after the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit,

287
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,220
 they go out healing the sick, speaking in tongues,

288
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,340
 casting out demons, and doing all sorts of things

289
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,700
 in the power of the Holy Spirit.

290
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,180
 And we have the ability to look back on these things.

291
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,140
 And as we put our faith in Jesus now,

292
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,180
 we can also be filled with the same Holy Spirit.

293
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,620
 But here, Zechariah's looking ahead.

294
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,100
 He's speaking of things that haven't actually happened.

295
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,660
 Things he had heard by word of mouth

296
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,580
 or by reading the scrolls.

297
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,380
 So verses 68 to 65.

298
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,900
 Let's have a little look.

299
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,700
 Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,

300
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,820
 because he has come to his people and redeemed them.

301
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,180
 He's raised up a horn of salvation for us

302
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,440
 in the house of his servant David,

303
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,740
 as he said through his holy prophets of long ago.

304
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,220
 Salvation from our enemies

305
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,500
 and from the hand of all who hate us.

306
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,420
 To show mercy to our ancestors

307
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,660
 and to remember his holy covenant,

308
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,320
 the oath he swore our father Abraham.

309
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,540
 To rescue us from the hand of our enemies

310
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,180
 and to enable us to serve him without fear

311
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,580
 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

312
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,860
 Zechariah is pointing to the coming Christ

313
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,380
 in this prophecy.

314
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,140
 He's sent to earth to redeem and save mankind,

315
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,460
 the most important event in our history.

316
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,680
 That through the family of David,

317
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,580
 a revered king amongst the Israelites,

318
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,980
 the ultimate king Jesus would come

319
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,300
 and fulfill the word of God.

320
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,700
 That all the Old Testament prophecies,

321
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,300
 all the words that God spoke before

322
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,420
 through the prophets would come to pass.

323
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,060
 So in case you missed it,

324
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,980
 this prophecy is all about Jesus.

325
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,980
 And we know that it is true

326
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,580
 because all of this has actually happened.

327
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,380
 Just as he said it would.

328
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,860
 Everything is about him.

329
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,980
 Zechariah realized that his own life,

330
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,920
 the birth of John, the surrounding events,

331
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,280
 they were all part of a greater story.

332
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,860
 By praising the Lord,

333
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,980
 he actively participated in the move of God

334
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,420
 and what he was doing at that time.

335
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,580
 He didn't look at his own life,

336
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,640
 nor did he focus on the birth of his son

337
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,220
 or put that at the forefront.

338
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,860
 All of that was secondary.

339
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,240
 He knew that greater things were to come.

340
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,540
 His humility opened him up to seeing

341
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,740
 that he was not the main character.

342
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,820
 And surprise, surprise guys,

343
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,020
 neither are we.

344
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,940
 Even in our own lives,

345
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,700
 our stories are no longer about us.

346
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,460
 The minute we become Christians,

347
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,680
 we often say we've given our lives to Christ.

348
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
 He becomes the first and the last.

349
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,960
 And we surrender everything to him.

350
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,720
 We give him the praise,

351
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,400
 we give him the honor.

352
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,200
 Colossians 3 says we do everything as unto the Lord.

353
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,560
 So that's your work life,

354
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,960
 the way you speak to each other,

355
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,760
 your family, what we put in our bodies,

356
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,200
 everything is for him and about him.

357
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,040
 So we are no longer the main characters.

358
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,620
 Now, I'm gonna take you back

359
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,880
 to our little Netflix example.

360
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,960
 By show of hands, please,

361
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,100
 have a good look at these four guys.

362
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,940
 I'm gonna point to one and I'm gonna ask

363
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,540
 how many people recognize this person.

364
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,960
 So I'm gonna start with this guy.

365
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,580
 Show of hands, how many of you have ever seen this man?

366
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,420
 Okay.

367
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,120
 This guy.

368
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,060
 Oh yeah.

369
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,860
 This guy.

370
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,500
 Maybe.

371
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,220
 This guy.

372
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,920
 Yeah.

373
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,160
 (laughing)

374
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,720
 That was the response I was hoping for, guys.

375
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,620
 That was the response I was hoping for.

376
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,880
 Now, you only recognize these two guys.

377
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,640
 This one here, this one.

378
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,200
 A few, maybe like three people recognize this guy.

379
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,960
 This guy, no one recognized this guy, which is great.

380
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,520
 (laughing)

381
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,520
 So you recognize these two the most

382
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,040
 because they are the main characters in their films.

383
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,440
 They're the main actors.

384
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,640
 So the storylines are centered around them,

385
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,500
 their lives, there might be some random love interest

386
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,320
 in there or something.

387
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,480
 But for the most part, everything is about those guys.

388
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,860
 And it's interesting how they manage to keep us interested

389
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,880
 and invested in this character throughout the whole film.

390
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,240
 The other two guys, you ask, never seen them before?

391
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,720
 Nope, I had never seen them either

392
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,360
 until I started preparing for this sermon.

393
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,520
 And that's because they are actually stunt doubles.

394
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,360
 Yeah.

395
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,560
 So a stunt double is a trained professional

396
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,920
 who stands in for an actor to perform dangerous

397
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,000
 or demanding tasks.

398
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,160
 So, obviously, you won't see the actual Daniel Craig

399
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,720
 jumping out of a helicopter or a building.

400
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,840
 It will be a stunt double.

401
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,080
 The two guys from the previous slides

402
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,280
 were their stunt doubles.

403
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
 So those are the people that will be doing

404
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,840
 all the dangerous things.

405
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,960
 Yeah, so the actor does the majority of the film

406
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,560
 with no regard for the stunt double.

407
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,960
 All of the easy things, goes about his business.

408
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,800
 But when he or she comes to that scene

409
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,200
 that requires a bit more strength,

410
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,640
 that's a bit dangerous, could cause a bit of harm or pain,

411
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,680
 they just step aside, let the stunt double come and do it,

412
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,680
 and they do it to perfection.

413
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,280
 But they're always in the background.

414
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,520
 No one ever knows there was a stunt double.

415
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,000
 It happens so quickly, and there's never a pause

416
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
 in the film that says,

417
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,200
 "This stunt was performed by a stunt double."

418
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,440
 Never, ever happens.

419
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,040
 And if you don't know much about films,

420
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,320
 or you blink a bit too quickly,

421
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,880
 you may assume that it was the main actor who did it.

422
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,560
 And all of the awards, all of the accolades,

423
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,680
 go to the main actor.

424
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,200
 There is not an Oscar for stunt doubles.

425
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
 Surprise, surprise.

426
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,440
 - There should be, right?

427
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,400
 - There should be, right?

428
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,240
 But there isn't.

429
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,440
 (laughing)

430
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,680
 Now, think about your own life for a second.

431
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,320
 How many times have we been the main characters

432
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,880
 in our own stories,

433
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,840
 and relegated God to our stunt double?

434
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,120
 We call him when times are tough.

435
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,320
 He comes in, he does the job,

436
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,280
 and then we push him to the background.

437
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,880
 No praise, no honor, no recognition.

438
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,600
 It's all about us.

439
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,440
 And as I was preparing for this sermon,

440
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,720
 I actually had to humble myself and repent,

441
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,760
 because I realized that I was doing the exact same thing.

442
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,000
 I was in two minds about doing this sermon.

443
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,280
 And I had like a million questions.

444
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,480
 I've narrowed them down.

445
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,080
 Should I?

446
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,800
 Shouldn't I?

447
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,560
 All eyes on me.

448
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,800
 I may not be able to just fade into the background

449
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
 after doing this.

450
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,560
 I don't particularly like speaking in public.

451
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,280
 What if I say the wrong thing?

452
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,240
 I'm not a pastor.

453
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,720
 Should I be preaching?

454
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,120
 Now, let's look at those questions again.

455
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,880
 And I've made all of the I's and all of the me's bold.

456
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,440
 So we can all count it together.

457
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,440
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

458
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,360
 Eight times.

459
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,720
 And trust me, I had way more questions.

460
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,800
 There's way more I's and me's.

461
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,640
 Loads more.

462
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,200
 So how many times did I talk about myself?

463
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,040
 - Eight times.

464
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,080
 - How many times did I mention God?

465
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,280
 How many times did I mention His will?

466
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,400
 What He has to say?

467
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,400
 I had made preaching and declaring His word all about me.

468
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,240
 And we often go about life in this exact same way.

469
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,520
 We live for ourselves.

470
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,440
 We wake up in the morning, it's about our kids,

471
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,040
 our spouses, our jobs, what we're gonna eat,

472
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,360
 what we're gonna wear, what will people think of us,

473
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,440
 where we need to be, what we need to do.

474
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,440
 We often don't even consider what God has for us each day.

475
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,680
 And we go through the motions, doing life,

476
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,320
 going through the script, saying our lines,

477
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,400
 until we get to the crossroad

478
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
 where we need our trusted stunt double.

479
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,520
 And in preparing for this sermon,

480
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,800
 perhaps my mindset should have been this instead.

481
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,000
 What does God want to share with His church?

482
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,120
 How will He use me?

483
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,720
 I'm gonna read that again.

484
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,320
 What does God want to share with His church?

485
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,120
 How will God, how will He use me?

486
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,880
 See, once you change your perspective

487
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,520
 and you shift your gaze to Him,

488
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,000
 you realize that it isn't about you.

489
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,560
 You are not the main character.

490
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,240
 He is.

491
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,240
 And it is about what He wants to do in and through you.

492
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,240
 Now, Zachariah had the right idea.

493
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,760
 He made God the center

494
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,720
 and had set his eyes on the things above.

495
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,160
 Luke 1:6 says, "He and Elizabeth were righteous

496
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,700
 "in the sight of God, observing His commands blamelessly,

497
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,040
 "and even after doubting, He was obedient

498
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,940
 "and followed the word of the Lord,

499
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,060
 "praising God and looking to Him as the most important."

500
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:16,560
 What he had just experienced was an afterthought.

501
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,720
 When he looked ahead at what was to come,

502
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,800
 all of the prophecies of old were about to be seen

503
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,640
 in his day, and his son would prepare the way

504
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,200
 for the Messiah, the Christ, the Redeemer,

505
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,200
 the horn or the strength of salvation.

506
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,600
 He would see scriptures that he had heard

507
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
 as a boy fulfilled.

508
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,560
 And only after he speaks about Christ

509
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,380
 does he mention John, his son.

510
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,040
 Jesus was always first.

511
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,080
 And when we believe in God and we believe in His words

512
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,080
 and we're obedient to Him, we make Him the main character,

513
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,920
 just like Zachariah did.

514
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
 As we build our lives on Him,

515
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,400
 He becomes the center and we become a part

516
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,360
 of the big story that He is writing.

517
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,120
 (pages rustling)

518
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,140
 Let's just take 10 seconds

519
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,460
 and just have a think about that last part.

520
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,320
 As we build our lives on Him, He becomes the center.

521
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,320
 We become a part of the big story that He is writing.

522
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,060
 (pages rustling)

523
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:51,900
 Can we just call up the worship team?

524
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:59,600
 So I want us to have a think about our own lives.

525
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,460
 How do we see Jesus?

526
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,080
 Is He the main character?

527
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,480
 Are we part of His great story?

528
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,940
 Or is He a tiny part of ours, like a stunt double?

529
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:22,640
 So there's this worship song that I absolutely adore

530
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,980
 and it goes like this.

531
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,240
 I'm not gonna sing, by the way.

532
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,480
 (laughing)

533
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,280
 No, I'm not gonna break into song.

534
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,720
 It seemed like a moment, right?

535
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,560
 No, no, no.

536
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,740
 (laughing)

537
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,500
 I'm gonna read the words.

538
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,960
 (laughing)

539
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,800
 No, no, no.

540
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,380
 (laughing)

541
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,400
 It says, "Turn your eyes upon Jesus.

542
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,700
 "Look full in His wonderful face

543
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,640
 "and the things of earth will grow strangely dim

544
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,260
 "in the light of His glory and grace."

545
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,460
 I'm gonna read it again.

546
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,780
 "Turn your eyes upon Jesus.

547
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,700
 "Look full in His wonderful face

548
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,700
 "and the things of earth will grow strangely dim

549
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,400
 "in the light of His glory and grace."

550
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,660
 If we can all just close our eyes for a second.

551
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,580
 (soft piano music)

552
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:47,940
 Lord, help us to fix our eyes on you.

553
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:53,220
 To turn our eyes to you for all of our needs.

554
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,780
 To look to you as our source of strength and peace,

555
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,940
 our guide, our help in times of trouble,

556
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,020
 but also in times of blessing.

557
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,020
 That we will not forget that you are the main character.

558
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,140
 That our lives are about you and bringing you glory.

559
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,260
 And that when we start to look up to God,

560
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,540
 instead of looking ahead on earth,

561
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,140
 the things that aren't important to God

562
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,960
 really do fade away.

563
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,220
 Our fleshly desires, our pride, our selfish ways,

564
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,500
 and we start to love God more and love His people.

565
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,580
 It's all about you, Lord.

566
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,860
 Lord, in our finances,

567
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,460
 we ask that you would help to steward

568
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,180
 what you have given us.

569
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,380
 In our homes, Lord,

570
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,860
 we would ask how we can honour you with our children,

571
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,260
 with our spouses and relatives.

572
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,220
 In our workplaces,

573
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:07,140
 we would ask how we can glorify you

574
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,820
 in our behaviour towards our colleagues and our bosses.

575
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,300
 In our serving, Lord,

576
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,100
 we would humble ourselves and see our giftings

577
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,100
 as a way to build up your church body and praise you.

578
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,340
 On our commute to work, Lord,

579
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,740
 we would ask how can I show God's love?

580
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,820
 Giving up my seat, perhaps?

581
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,860
 Very rare.

582
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:43,100
 There are so many areas of our lives

583
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,780
 that we need your help, God.

584
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,740
 We don't want to be the main character, Lord.

585
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,460
 That's your job.

586
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:56,020
 And Lord, help us to do it joyfully.

587
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,300
 Lord, there is joy in serving you.

588
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,460
 There is joy in giving our lives to you, Lord.

589
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:10,740
 Let's just take a moment.

590
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,380
 If anything is coming up,

591
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,500
 if God is pointing out anything

592
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,180
 that you may need to repent of,

593
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,340
 you can do that now.

594
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:38,700
 Yeah, Lord, help us to just continue

595
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,300
 to live our lives for you.

596
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,620
 It's all about you, Jesus.

597
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,220
 (gentle music)

598
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,860
 Thank you, Lord.

644
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,460
 And help us to love you more.

 Let's continue in worship.

 Let's respond to God.
