1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
 Well, good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,180
 My name is Pastor Promise.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,880
 Every time I say the words, "Pastor Promise,"

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,900
 it feels weird.

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,780
 Call her, I'm Dada, to my daughter.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,620
 My daughter is here.

7
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,660
 She's never here at the 11 o'clock,

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,620
 so this is gonna be nice and challenging.

9
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,860
 Well, hey, I'm glad that you guys are here.

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,760
 You chose to be here this morning.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,720
 So the sermon writing process is an interesting one.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,280
 We pray, we ask God, we write down the words,

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,760
 and we pass it on to someone to look at it and to edit it

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,520
 and to make sure that we are going in the right direction.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000
 And we've prayed over today's sermon,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,560
 and we're gonna preach that.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,500
 Don't worry, Andrew, I'm not gonna go off script.

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,040
 But I wanna plead with you guys.

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,680
 I kinda wanna put out what my intention

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,480
 with this whole sermon is.

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,640
 And beyond my intention, what I believe God's intention

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,400
 with today's sermon is.

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,400
 You guys wanna know what God desires you to get out of this?

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,520
 Anyone here?

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,100
 Yeah?

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,100
 I plead with you that in listening to the words today,

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,520
 that you would consider in your heart

28
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,040
 what it means to follow Jesus.

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,600
 I plead with you today that you would consider in your heart

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
 what are the things of God,

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,100
 and do those things create excitement in me?

32
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,880
 Are those things that I'm aligned with,

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,200
 that I desire to see in the world fulfilled through him?

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,220
 I plead with you today that you would ask yourself,

35
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,900
 how do I truly follow who Jesus is?

36
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,760
 That is my hope.

37
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,340
 That is all I wanna get out of today's sermon.

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,700
 And I really want you guys to sit in this place of wrestling.

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,260
 What does it mean to follow Jesus,

40
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,260
 and how do I make sure I follow him?

41
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,120
 'Cause that's what it's all about, right?

42
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,520
 We gather, we worship, we sing,

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,160
 but we've got to become people who follow Jesus.

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,880
 That's from the bottom of my heart.

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,320
 That's where I hope we land today.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,020
 So we're continuing this series of Uncharted.

47
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,100
 And as we were studying, looking through it,

48
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,780
 I did a little bit of research,

49
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,660
 a little bit of homework to look and see

50
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,660
 that our New Testament has 27 books inside.

51
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,140
 A lot of books.

52
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,340
 27 books inside the New Testament.

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,620
 Of those 27 books,

54
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,060
 half of them are written by the same guy, right?

55
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,140
 Does anyone know who that is?

56
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,540
 Just to see if...

57
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,540
 Anyone?

58
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,460
 Say it with your chest, anyone?

59
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,300
 Paul, there we go.

60
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,300
 Yes, well done.

61
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,740
 Paul has written more than half of the books

62
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,460
 in the New Testament.

63
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,280
 This is incredible.

64
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,540
 He's written all these letters that we call epistles.

65
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,820
 These books, which purposes are to reveal Jesus, yes,

66
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,140
 but to help edify, help grow,

67
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,140
 help replenish the churches all across the Roman Empire.

68
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,660
 These letters are written to churches

69
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,120
 that he's either started or established or planted himself.

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,700
 Here at the Vine, 2000 plus years later,

71
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,540
 we are benefic, benefic, beneficians?

72
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,380
 There we go.

73
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,140
 Beneficiaries, benefactors, all the benefits.

74
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,780
 We benefit, there's a word for you.

75
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,820
 We benefit from what Paul wrote.

76
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,460
 In Ephesians, his letter to the church in Ephesus,

77
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,060
 he writes this prayer.

78
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,660
 He goes, "I pray that we would grasp how wide and long

79
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,260
 "and how high and how deep is the love of Christ

80
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,820
 "and to know this love which passes knowledge,

81
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,960
 "that we would be filled to the measure

82
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,040
 "of all the fullness of God."

83
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,320
 Filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.

84
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,400
 That's where we get our very purpose here at the Vine

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,480
 in growing big people, that we would grow in understanding

86
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,880
 and all the measure of the fullness of God.

87
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,360
 Paul is an incredible figure.

88
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,080
 His role within that first century church

89
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,560
 is to bring together these two communities,

90
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,060
 Gentiles who were people who were not heirs

91
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,040
 of the promise of God.

92
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,200
 They were outside of that promise.

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,300
 They were ethnically a different group of people.

94
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,840
 So all the promises of the Old Testament,

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,100
 all the good news, didn't apply to them.

96
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,000
 But through Paul, the Holy Spirit would bring these people

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,760
 and the Jewish believers, these new Christians

98
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,320
 together in one community.

99
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,160
 Paul would be something like a unifying factor

100
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,400
 to help bring together a unified community.

101
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
 If you've been in church for any time,

102
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,120
 you would know that Paul's letters are super popular.

103
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,800
 Some of the words he uses are pretty awesome, right?

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,760
 A little bit of Bible bingo for you.

105
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,840
 Paul wrote, let's see, "The Armor of God."

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,680
 You guys know that one?

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
 "The Armor of God."

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
 "The fruits of the Spirit."

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,960
 "Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness."

110
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,720
 If you've been to any wedding ever,

111
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,760
 you've probably heard one of his famous ones.

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,280
 The first Corinthians, "Love is patient, love is kind."

113
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,320
 Everyone really loves that one

114
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
 when they have someone that they love

115
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,360
 and they wanna say it to.

116
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,720
 Or perhaps maybe his most tattooable.

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
 Yeah, Paul wrote some things that people have probably,

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,240
 there might be someone in this room with a tattoo of this.

119
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,480
 And I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

120
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,440
 Right?

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,120
 Some incredible statements are given to us

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
 through the life of Paul.

123
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,460
 But I don't wanna just paint Paul out to be someone

124
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,400
 who said and wrote a lot of good things.

125
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,640
 Paul with his life lived incredibly.

126
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,120
 He went on three massive missionary journeys

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
 as a way to take the good news of the gospel

128
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,160
 throughout the Roman Empire,

129
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,960
 going out to city after city,

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
 planting and helping build and helping strengthen churches.

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,520
 He gets shipwrecked, he gets bitten by snakes,

132
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,480
 he gets threatened, he gets stoned.

133
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
 All these things that happened to him,

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,580
 persecuted, eventually ends up dying.

135
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,800
 He gives his life to make sure

136
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,100
 that the world knows who Jesus is.

137
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,520
 He would say that compared to the pain he would feel,

138
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,120
 that the joy of knowing Christ is even greater.

139
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,120
 He would say, "I count everything as lost just to know him."

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,440
 Paul is what you would call a hero of our faith.

141
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,240
 Said a lot of good things, wrote a lot of good things,

142
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
 did a lot of good things.

143
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,440
 He really helped establish Christianity as we know it today.

144
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,680
 But this hero of our faith was not always a hero

145
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,160
 of our faith.

146
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,800
 You could say this, Paul had a past.

147
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,040
 Paul did some pretty dodgy things

148
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,440
 before he became a Christian.

149
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,560
 So someone who's known for being one

150
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
 who is building up the church

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
 and helping strengthen their church,

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,700
 before he was a Christian, was the exact opposite of this.

153
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,760
 His name wasn't Paul, his name was Saul back then.

154
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,760
 And he lived to eradicate this Jesus following movement

155
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,400
 that existed in Jerusalem and throughout the region.

156
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,120
 His goal was to make sure

157
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,800
 that this Jesus movement stopped.

158
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,880
 His early career, he persecuted and jailed and beat

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
 and even had people killed who believed this Jesus person

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
 and aligned themselves with him.

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,640
 So how ironic that the thing he's most famous for

162
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,240
 was the thing that he hated so much

163
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,320
 before his transformation.

164
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,100
 But he does have a transformation.

165
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,140
 There is a change from a Saul to a Paul.

166
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,820
 And if you've been in church any time,

167
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,800
 this will be somewhat of a popular story

168
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,480
 or familiar story where he is,

169
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,520
 the apostles would say he is breathing murderous threats

170
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
 against those who believe in Jesus.

171
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,120
 And he's given permission by the chief priests

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
 to go outside of Jerusalem and into Damascus

173
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
 to round up the Christians there

174
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
 and bring them back to Jerusalem for persecution.

175
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
 So he's on his way.

176
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,840
 He, with the people that he needs,

177
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,160
 with the authority that he has,

178
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,440
 on his way to go and persecute more Christians.

179
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,720
 When all of a sudden a light from heaven shines down on him,

180
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,720
 he falls off of his horse and he sees Jesus,

181
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,640
 Jesus standing before him.

182
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,360
 Jesus asked him this question.

183
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,320
 He goes, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

184
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,200
 And in that moment, Saul has an encounter

185
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,880
 that changes his life.

186
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,640
 He experiences Jesus and leaves that experience blind,

187
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,480
 cannot see.

188
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,040
 Maybe the most powerful person all of a sudden now,

189
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,040
 maybe one of the most vulnerable people.

190
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,880
 His transformation is not complete though.

191
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,360
 See, God started something in that road to Damascus

192
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,920
 that would be completed through the Holy Spirit

193
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,440
 working with another person.

194
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,320
 Someone else was going to have to pay a pretty big cost.

195
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,120
 Someone else would have to intervene

196
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,120
 and help establish Paul into who he would be.

197
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,240
 This is where we get the story of Ananias.

198
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,200
 So today our teaching text is gonna be found

199
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,800
 in Acts chapter nine, starting at verse 10.

200
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
 So I'm gonna open my Bible.

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,960
 If you have one of these old relics,

202
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,800
 Bibles, physical ones, you can open it with me as well.

203
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,120
 Looking here in Acts chapter nine, starting at verse 10.

204
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,240
 If you don't have a Bible,

205
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,480
 it will be provided for you on the screen.

206
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,320
 I'm gonna read this out.

207
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,440
 It says, in Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias.

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
 The Lord called to him in a vision, Ananias.

209
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,240
 Yes, Lord, he answered.

210
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,640
 Lord told him, go to the house of Judas on Straight Street

211
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,640
 and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul,

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
 for he is praying.

213
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,440
 So in a vision, he has seen a man named Ananias come

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,280
 and place his hands on him to restore his sight.

215
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,100
 Lord, Ananias answered, I have heard many reports

216
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,620
 about this man and all the harm he has done

217
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,520
 to your holy people in Jerusalem.

218
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,920
 And he has come here with the authority

219
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,400
 from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.

220
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,720
 But the Lord said to Ananias, go.

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,240
 This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name

222
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,160
 to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel.

223
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,520
 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.

224
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,080
 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it,

225
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,840
 placing his hands on Saul.

226
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,160
 He said, brother Saul, the Lord Jesus,

227
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,320
 who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here,

228
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,440
 he has sent me so that you may see again

229
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,320
 and be filled with the Holy Spirit.

230
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
 And immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes

231
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,160
 and he could see again.

232
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
 He got up and was baptized.

233
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,920
 And after taking some food, he regained his strength.

234
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,360
 Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.

235
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,080
 At once, he began preaching in the synagogues

236
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,880
 that Jesus is the son of God.

237
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,920
 All those who heard him were astonished.

238
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
 And they asked, isn't he the man

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,560
 who raised havoc in Jerusalem

240
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,080
 among those who call on this name?

241
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,320
 And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners

242
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,600
 to the chief priests?

243
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,560
 Yet Saul grew more and more powerful

244
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,280
 and baffled the Jews living in Damascus

245
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,360
 by proving that Jesus was the Messiah.

246
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
 Let me pray for us.

247
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,420
 Jesus, we come before you this morning.

248
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,520
 We open your word and we ask Holy Spirit,

249
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,880
 not for interesting thoughts and good comprehension, God,

250
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,480
 but that your living, breathing word would do what it does.

251
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,240
 It would penetrate into our hearts,

252
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,940
 that it would begin to transform us

253
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,720
 as we see you through this story.

254
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
 Would you open our ears?

255
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
 Would you make our hearts fertile soil

256
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,440
 for the things that you have for us this morning?

257
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,300
 We pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.

258
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,000
 So basically Ananias is this person

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
 who's gonna be used in the transformation of Saul.

260
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,840
 This is a guy who we know very little about.

261
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,600
 Raise your hand if you know anything about Ananias.

262
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,040
 Hey, besides Pastor Andrew.

263
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,840
 Not really, like we don't know who that is.

264
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,120
 Saul, Paul we know, John, Peter, those are big names.

265
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,760
 Ananias, never heard of the guy, right?

266
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,000
 No one really knows him.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,720
 But this is about to be his moment.

268
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,960
 While living under persecution in the first century,

269
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,460
 we're gonna see that God calls out to Ananias

270
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,080
 to go into the known.

271
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 Now I wrestled with whether or not to say it like this.

272
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,320
 Into the known should make you be like, wait,

273
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,000
 our whole series that we're on is about the unknown, right?

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,920
 The uncharted, right?

275
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,160
 Like that's what we're talking about.

276
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,560
 How does God calling Ananias to go into the known?

277
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,080
 Well, in this case, yes, the whole journey as a whole

278
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,520
 and how it's gonna play out is unknown,

279
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,920
 but there are things that he does know.

280
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,280
 He's aware of the cost that this is gonna be for him.

281
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,800
 He's aware of who Saul is, right?

282
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,440
 So he's aware that he's about to step into a very dangerous,

283
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,560
 tricky, challenging, and hard situation.

284
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,320
 And it probably makes him uncomfortable a little bit.

285
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,320
 What he would know is that this would require some risk.

286
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,040
 And Ananias is gonna have to ask himself,

287
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,080
 where does he truly stand?

288
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,960
 A call to the uncharted where Ananias

289
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,520
 is going to have to weigh his options.

290
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,640
 He's gonna have to consider his beliefs

291
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,440
 and where his trust truly is.

292
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,240
 Where Ananias is gonna have to ask himself,

293
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,480
 do I believe enough to follow?

294
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,120
 I believe, but do I believe enough to follow?

295
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,200
 Or does my belief in Jesus boil down

296
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,880
 to a collection of interesting information

297
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,800
 that I've gathered?

298
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,520
 He has to ask himself if he believes enough to be obedient

299
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,280
 to the call that is put on him.

300
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,960
 This is all part of the uncharted journey

301
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,040
 that you and I are also on.

302
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,880
 We are going to be stepping into seasons

303
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,800
 if we've not already, where God's gonna be calling us

304
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,520
 to do some pretty risky, dangerous,

305
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,960
 maybe seemingly crazy things.

306
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,040
 And we're gonna be faced with that question.

307
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,600
 Do I believe enough to trust him and to follow him?

308
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 Do I believe enough to step into this known challenge?

309
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
 Do I believe enough to follow him

310
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,200
 into the uncharted territories and uncharted spaces?

311
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,120
 Knowing this would be challenging,

312
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,320
 knowing this is gonna cost us.

313
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,520
 See, Pastor Andrew last week said something

314
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,680
 that I thought was really, really, really good.

315
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,160
 She does say quite a few things regularly,

316
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,000
 they're pretty good.

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,760
 But this time, it was this one that I was like,

318
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
 whew, gonna say it again.

319
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,800
 So I'm gonna put it back up here.

320
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,680
 He's talking about the idea of persecution.

321
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,000
 And I want you to remind us of this.

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,840
 He said this, "When putting Christ first

323
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,600
 "comes with great personal cost,

324
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,360
 "we are tempted to choose what is safe

325
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,280
 "rather than obedience to him."

326
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,960
 (child yelling)

327
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,400
 My daughter said, "Amen, that's awesome."

328
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,720
 (audience laughing)

329
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,920
 Thanks, honey.

330
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,600
 This is the very position that Ananias is in.

331
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,080
 God is extending an invitation to something

332
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,160
 that seems crazy, something that's never been done before.

333
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,480
 For him to go against the grain,

334
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,080
 something that's gonna require him

335
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,920
 to have new levels of dependency on God.

336
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
 See, the rumors of who saw what,

337
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,520
 was well known, everyone knew who Saul would be.

338
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,400
 Saul's killings and his persecution,

339
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,960
 he was efficient at what he did

340
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,280
 when it came to persecuting Christians.

341
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,160
 And this would be the backdrop

342
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,200
 in which God would invite Ananias

343
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,560
 into following him into the uncharted.

344
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,200
 I love the way that Luke tells this story

345
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,560
 because he tells it in a very interesting way.

346
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,040
 The way he writes it,

347
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,640
 he's telling it in a very interesting way.

348
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,200
 He writes it, highlights certain things to the reader

349
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,000
 that we need to understand

350
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,400
 when it comes to stepping into situations just like this.

351
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
 With Ananias, Luke actually doesn't give us

352
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,960
 many details about him.

353
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,240
 It's actually quite a short little bit he tells us.

354
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,920
 What Luke chooses to disclose about Ananias

355
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,600
 is perhaps the only small detail.

356
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,320
 But it's not about his family, it's not about his status,

357
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,800
 it's not about his church attendance,

358
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,120
 it's not about what he served in

359
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,600
 and what team he served with.

360
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,560
 It's not about any of that stuff.

361
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,640
 It's not about how much money he had, who he was.

362
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,120
 None of that stuff seemed to matter.

363
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,760
 What Luke ends up telling us about Ananias

364
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,680
 is something about his identity.

365
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,080
 And perhaps the most important thing about Ananias

366
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
 is boiled down to this.

367
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,880
 This little identity concept

368
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,680
 would be the way Ananias would shape

369
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,360
 how he made his decisions.

370
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,080
 It would be what would make him ultimately Ananias.

371
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,000
 It'd be how he would weigh his options

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,080
 in difficult situations.

373
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,760
 What Luke gives us is this.

374
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,360
 He says, "In Damascus, there was a disciple named Ananias."

375
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,920
 So what's Ananias' big descriptor?

376
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,520
 What's the big detail about Ananias?

377
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
 He's a disciple.

378
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,000
 That's it.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
 Nothing else.

380
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,680
 He is a disciple.

381
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,960
 So Luke deems the only detail worth noting,

382
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,280
 or better yet, the one detail that tells you

383
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,440
 everything you need to know about who Ananias is

384
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,960
 is that he is a disciple of Jesus.

385
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,360
 He believes and he follows in Jesus.

386
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,740
 This word disciple is a common word in our New Testament.

387
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,560
 Across the first five books of the New Testament,

388
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,280
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts,

389
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,280
 the word disciple appears 261 times.

390
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,160
 This is a common word.

391
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,760
 And it simply means this, one who follows.

392
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,600
 Right?

393
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,160
 So we can, a disciple is someone who follows.

394
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,960
 When we hear disciples at the very beginning

395
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,580
 of the gospels in Matthew,

396
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,920
 what is it that they're called to do?

397
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,960
 Come and follow me, is what Jesus tells them.

398
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,560
 It's the very nature of a disciple to live

399
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,640
 and respond into adherence of the person

400
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,920
 that they're following.

401
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,740
 Right?

402
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,600
 They go with that person where that person goes.

403
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,320
 So then a disciple of Jesus, as Ananias would be,

404
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,920
 would be one who would follow Jesus in his belief patterns,

405
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,360
 follow Jesus in his ideological leanings,

406
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,100
 follow Jesus in his behavior, in his practice.

407
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,880
 The follower of Jesus would be one who follows Jesus

408
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,400
 in his prioritization, in his preferences,

409
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,920
 in his decision-making process,

410
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,160
 in his posture towards society and culture.

411
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,280
 This is what it means to be a disciple,

412
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,800
 a specifically disciple of Jesus.

413
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,100
 So as a disciple of Jesus, Ananias lives a certain way,

414
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,620
 responding to the belief that he has in Jesus.

415
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,460
 Right?

416
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,420
 He has decided that Christ is enough.

417
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,480
 We sang it earlier, right?

418
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
 Christ is enough for me.

419
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,300
 Like he liked that song too.

420
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,720
 Everything in his life was going to exist

421
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,360
 to respond to who Jesus was.

422
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,600
 So when God calls him into this ridiculously challenging,

423
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,760
 hard, really clearly difficult situation

424
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,060
 of going to Saul, who is a murderous persecutor,

425
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,580
 the posture of his discipleship

426
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,480
 is what's gonna make it possible for him to follow

427
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,000
 into the known dangers, into the uncharted areas.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,440
 Because Luke identifies Ananias as a disciple,

429
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,960
 it should give us the readers a bit of a foreshadowing

430
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,460
 as to what's gonna happen, right?

431
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,220
 Because he's a disciple, we should therefore know

432
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,360
 what his decision is gonna be.

433
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,580
 His decision is gonna be, yes, I'm gonna follow

434
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,960
 because disciples follow.

435
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
 It's like playing, I remember the first time I heard

436
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,060
 the idea of what a disciple was,

437
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,240
 someone did like a cool little like skit for me.

438
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,880
 They played, has anyone played the game Follow the Leader?

439
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
 Did I make it?

440
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,540
 Yeah, yeah, Follow the Leader.

441
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,520
 So one person starts walking and then you just follow them.

442
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,560
 That's literally what a disciple does.

443
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,120
 They follow that person.

444
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
 So for Ananias, whatever he's about to be asked,

445
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,320
 no matter how much we know about him,

446
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,760
 because we know he's a disciple,

447
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,240
 we can be certain that he is going to follow Jesus.

448
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,200
 But Ananias does have a choice

449
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,600
 because Jesus isn't the only thing that can be followed.

450
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,640
 There's quite a few things we can follow.

451
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,340
 For many of us in this season of uncharted,

452
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,740
 whether we face it now or we're gonna be facing it,

453
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,200
 we're gonna be faced with the choice

454
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,880
 of what are we actually going to follow?

455
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,920
 And I know it could seem easy.

456
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,320
 Well, if you're Christian, we follow Jesus, right?

457
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,680
 Sometimes it's not that easy.

458
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,440
 In moments when it's challenging,

459
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,880
 we can find ourselves if we're not careful,

460
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,800
 actually following the circumstance and not Jesus.

461
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,480
 As in we are tempted to follow Jesus

462
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,160
 only when the situation ahead,

463
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,440
 the circumstance ahead seems right,

464
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,680
 according to our observation,

465
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,560
 seems favorable according to our observations.

466
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,360
 When verses like Psalm chapter 23,

467
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
 where he leads us by still water,

468
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,920
 where he leads us into green pastures,

469
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
 when Jesus does that, I mean, sign me up,

470
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,680
 I'm ready to follow, right?

471
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,100
 That sounds like a good chance of following the leader.

472
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,440
 I would love some green pastures

473
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,020
 and some still calm waters.

474
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,660
 But in the same book, in the same chapter,

475
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,760
 that following Jesus also continues

476
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,080
 into the valley of the shadow of death,

477
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 where our enemies are around us.

478
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,880
 For Ananias, it would be following Jesus

479
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,920
 would be following him into a conversation,

480
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 into an encounter with Saul,

481
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,700
 the very person who has the authority

482
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,340
 to take him in as a Jesus follower.

483
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,080
 When we find ourselves at this crossroads,

484
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,920
 will we follow what we observe?

485
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,640
 Will we follow how favorable the situation

486
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,080
 or circumstance is,

487
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,800
 or are we at risk of not following Jesus at all?

488
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,920
 And please don't get me wrong,

489
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,520
 I'm not saying that Jesus is saying,

490
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,040
 don't consider how challenging it is.

491
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,480
 I'm not saying that Jesus is saying,

492
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,680
 pretend like every challenging invitation is easy.

493
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,880
 Jesus has no desire for you to lie about how hard

494
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
 what he's calling you is.

495
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,440
 He's not called you to not feel or not observe

496
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,480
 or not have senses about what's going on.

497
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,460
 We are going to feel, he's given us senses for a reason.

498
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,520
 It's okay to acknowledge the feelings,

499
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,120
 but he's saying that you can't always follow

500
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,260
 the observations, you can't always follow

501
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,060
 your assessment of the road ahead.

502
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,860
 You can't always follow how you feel.

503
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,360
 At some point, the way of our feelings

504
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,320
 and the way of Jesus will clash.

505
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,120
 They will become opposites.

506
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,460
 And there are times where our feelings

507
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,380
 are simply meant to be felt and not followed.

508
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,540
 When things appear one way,

509
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,660
 know that God isn't calling us to follow an appearance

510
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,140
 because uncharted is an invitation

511
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,720
 to lean not on your own understandings,

512
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,000
 but to lean on him.

513
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,020
 The heavy reality for us is that we are at risk

514
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,820
 of actually not following Jesus,

515
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,620
 but instead following circumstances.

516
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,420
 That's just the truth.

517
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,520
 That's the temptation we have to wrestle with regularly.

518
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,760
 For many of us, I know our desire is to follow Jesus.

519
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,740
 We're here because we want to follow Jesus.

520
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,100
 So I just wanna make it really clear

521
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,780
 what the disguise things are,

522
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,320
 what the alternative paths are that present themselves

523
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,900
 as if we are following Jesus.

524
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,620
 It can be such a subtle temptation to follow a circumstance

525
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,180
 when it's good thinking that we're following Jesus.

526
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,540
 It requires a nuance and understanding.

527
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,580
 And I love that we have a good example

528
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,140
 of how Ananias felt tempted to do the exact same thing

529
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,580
 in verse 13, it reads this.

530
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,880
 He goes, "Lord," answered Ananias,

531
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,760
 "I have heard many reports about this man."

532
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,680
 I have observed, I have heard, I have seen.

533
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,800
 He is dangerous, right?

534
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,400
 And all the harm he has done to your holy people.

535
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,960
 He's come here with authority, God,

536
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,880
 from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.

537
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
 Ananias has a legit reason to have fear.

538
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,640
 Ananias has a legit reason because Saul is notorious

539
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,360
 at this point for his killings and his arrests,

540
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,440
 ruthlessly persecuting Christians.

541
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,840
 Saul is efficient.

542
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
 Everything Ananias is saying in this response to God

543
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,260
 is true, consider that.

544
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,480
 His fear is not wrong, it's true.

545
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,920
 Yet there's a difference in acknowledging the cost

546
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,340
 and being a disciple of a favorable circumstance.

547
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,200
 It's one thing in recognizing

548
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,240
 that this is gonna cost me much.

549
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,880
 It's another thing in allowing it to stop you

550
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,120
 from following Jesus into it anyways.

551
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,200
 This is what Ananias would have to wrestle with.

552
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,900
 Listen, uncharted, this season that we're going into,

553
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,400
 that we're in now,

554
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,500
 is not an invitation to favorable circumstances.

555
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,420
 I think we just need to get that clear.

556
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,480
 It's not an invitation to everything just going super well

557
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,520
 and super easy and not having any challenges.

558
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,080
 It's an invitation to follow the sovereign Jesus

559
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,180
 who has victory over both the favorable

560
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,600
 and the unfavorable circumstances, right?

561
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,440
 That's our Jesus.

562
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,240
 He has victory over all of that.

563
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,960
 And because Ananias is a disciple of Jesus,

564
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,000
 because he follows Christ alone,

565
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,920
 he's willing to walk into the known danger ahead of him.

566
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,120
 And when we follow Jesus alone,

567
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,360
 we too can be willing to walk.

568
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,060
 Yes, having some fear, but having a greater confidence

569
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,520
 because our eyes, our sight is fixed

570
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,840
 on the one that we follow, right?

571
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
 Fixed on the victorious Jesus

572
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,640
 who has overcome all things,

573
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,620
 even the conditions of the journey ahead.

574
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,640
 See, the decisions we are willing to make

575
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,000
 will show us what it is we truly follow.

576
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,600
 The decisions we are willing to make

577
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,320
 will show us what it is that we truly follow.

578
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 I find Ananias reminding God of Paul's,

579
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,160
 Saul's CV very interesting.

580
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,280
 He tells him, "Lord, there's many, many, many reports

581
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,120
 about this."

582
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,480
 Like you couldn't have missed this, right?

583
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,760
 This guy is a bad guy, straight out.

584
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,920
 There's nothing good about him.

585
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,120
 Did you get me the wrong person that you want me to go to?

586
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,220
 Because me being a Christian,

587
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,760
 someone that follows you stepping into a situation

588
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,600
 with this guy could be the end of me.

589
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,880
 God, are you sure this is who you want me to go to

590
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,920
 and help him?

591
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,360
 Right, that's a good question.

592
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,600
 That's a fair question.

593
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,240
 It's in moments like this that we realize

594
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,840
 that there is sacrifice involved in following Jesus.

595
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,560
 Disciples of Jesus will have to sacrifice

596
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,280
 at some point in our lives.

597
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,720
 But how does exactly does God get you from this space

598
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,040
 where you acknowledge your feelings

599
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,120
 and you acknowledge the difficulty ahead

600
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,160
 into actually then going and doing what it is?

601
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,280
 How does he get you from recognizing

602
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,880
 that it's gonna cost you a lot

603
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,080
 to faithfully living in obedience despite the cost?

604
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,120
 Well, let's look and see what he says to Ananias.

605
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,200
 He says this, "Go!"

606
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,040
 This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name

607
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,440
 to the Gentiles and to their kings

608
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,640
 and to the people of Israel.

609
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,800
 Can we appreciate the fact

610
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,000
 that God kind of ignores his questions?

611
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,960
 Like homeboy is like, I'm terrified, God,

612
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,920
 he's gonna kill me.

613
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,160
 He has all the authority

614
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,240
 and I'm gonna be the victim number one.

615
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,800
 You want me to go to the person who's after me?

616
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,200
 And God is like, but he's my chosen instrument.

617
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,560
 Like, what is that?

618
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,040
 Right, like, I mean, you would expect that God would just,

619
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,340
 for me, you know what would work?

620
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,000
 If I pray and I'm like, God, you know, this is challenging.

621
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,640
 If you would just give me some assurance,

622
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,400
 I feel like I'd be more confident to go

623
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,160
 and live out what God has called me to live, right?

624
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,600
 If he just said, all right, promise,

625
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,680
 go into this dangerous situation,

626
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,780
 go into a situation that's gonna cost you a lot.

627
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,540
 But he also said, it's okay,

628
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,840
 I'll make sure your bank account's still full.

629
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,360
 It's okay, I'll make sure no harm comes

630
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,720
 to you and your family.

631
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 It's okay, nothing about what you,

632
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,520
 the way you expect your life to go,

633
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
 it'll still go exactly like that.

634
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,240
 Then I'd be like, yeah, let's go

635
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,520
 into the known and the unknown.

636
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,600
 I don't really care, I would go with him, right?

637
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,280
 And I feel like most of us would do the same thing

638
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,080
 if God would just give us the assurance

639
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,240
 that it's gonna be okay.

640
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,080
 Just follow me, it's gonna be okay.

641
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,400
 Nothing bad's gonna happen.

642
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,560
 You don't have to worry about anything.

643
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,040
 It's all just gonna be good, good, good.

644
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,360
 There's no cost involved.

645
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,000
 If he just gave us this assurance, for so many of us,

646
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,480
 that's what it would take for us to follow.

647
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,320
 But he doesn't do this with Ananias.

648
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,560
 He does not assure him at all.

649
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,720
 He doesn't tell him that it's gonna be okay,

650
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,880
 that there's no chance for failure,

651
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,260
 that nothing bad will happen,

652
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,560
 that life will carry on like he expected it.

653
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,560
 - Yeah.

654
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,720
 - Now, see, God sees Ananias' desire for assurance,

655
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,280
 and instead he chooses to answer him by saying this.

656
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,680
 This man Saul is my chosen instrument

657
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,440
 to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings

658
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,320
 and to the people of Israel.

659
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,260
 Look at this.

660
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,120
 God takes a man looking for assurance

661
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,920
 and instead shows him purpose.

662
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,720
 Sit on that for a minute.

663
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,600
 God takes us when we're looking for this assurance

664
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,800
 that we're gonna be okay,

665
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,520
 that nothing dangerous or hard is gonna come to us.

666
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,360
 And instead of addressing that, he shows purpose.

667
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,500
 He's saying, Ananias, consider the things I have planned.

668
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,200
 You see Saul one way, but actually I see him differently.

669
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,080
 You see him as this great persecutor,

670
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,280
 but I being God who knows all things,

671
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,800
 where all things are possible, the way making God,

672
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,020
 I see him as the very person who takes the good news

673
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,520
 to all of the Gentiles, who extends the kingdom of heaven

674
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,840
 and brings them in all under this banner of Jesus

675
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,800
 as the church.

676
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,280
 I see him differently.

677
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
 He is my chosen instrument.

678
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,080
 The thing you fear is the very thing I'm gonna be using

679
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,560
 to extend the gospel.

680
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:58,500
 See, cost is often associated with value.

681
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,520
 God doesn't call us to sacrifice simply because,

682
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,980
 sounds fun, let's just test them and see how they do.

683
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,560
 He didn't call us to sacrifice just because it's a religion.

684
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,480
 No, the cost indicates that there is value

685
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,260
 on the other side.

686
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,360
 God shows Ananias the value by showing him the purpose.

687
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,620
 And it makes me wonder, I didn't make this a slide,

688
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,080
 so I want us to listen.

689
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,220
 It makes me wonder this, how many of our fears

690
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,040
 and our hesitations to respond to Jesus

691
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,800
 with a costly sacrifice need to be seen

692
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,320
 from a place of purpose rather than from a place

693
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,260
 of assurance?

694
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,000
 I'll say that again, 'cause it's not up here.

695
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,200
 How many of our fears and our hesitations to respond

696
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,280
 to Jesus with costly sacrifice need to be seen

697
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,220
 from a place of purpose rather than assurance?

698
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:52,520
 Would we even still, while feeling the feels,

699
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,360
 be more willing to step into uncharted territories,

700
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,520
 knowing that God isn't randomly leading us there,

701
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,060
 but he has valuable purpose planned?

702
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,360
 There is a cost because there is value.

703
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
 God's not wasteful.

704
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,520
 So it's only natural that we ask, what's the purpose?

705
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,100
 And in Ananias' case, God gives him a very clear,

706
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,840
 exact, distinct purpose behind why he calls him.

707
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,080
 So what's the purpose, God?

708
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,560
 The reality is that God's not always gonna give you

709
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,040
 the exact purpose.

710
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,320
 Can we just be real?

711
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,920
 He's not always gonna tell you exactly why you need

712
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,760
 to go through this hard thing.

713
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,720
 He's not always gonna show you the big picture

714
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,320
 and exactly how it's gonna play out.

715
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,680
 But for the Christian, for the follower of Jesus,

716
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,640
 for those of us that know him, the call is enough,

717
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,520
 'cause if we know him, we know his purposes.

718
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
 And what are his purposes?

719
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,520
 To bring the fullness of the kingdom of God here,

720
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,260
 where there's brokenness to fix it,

721
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,840
 where there's darkness to bring light,

722
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,400
 where there's despair to bring hope,

723
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
 where there's lies to bring truth,

724
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,960
 where there's insecurity to bring confidence,

725
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,440
 where there's absolute rubbish in the world

726
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,480
 to bring hope and to rebuild.

727
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,800
 So those are the purposes of God.

728
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,360
 Those are the things he's doing.

729
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
 Those are the ways he's moving.

730
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,520
 That's what his kingdom on earth looks like,

731
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,840
 setting the captives free,

732
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,360
 elevating the truth of the goodness of God,

733
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,880
 liberating us from sin and the hole that it has

734
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,000
 through the blood of Jesus.

735
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,280
 And if we forget these purposes,

736
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,840
 it becomes near impossible to willingly sacrifice.

737
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,520
 Again, I'm gonna quote Andrew.

738
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,640
 Last week, he said this about persecution.

739
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,040
 One of the things that we can do is deepen our roots.

740
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
 I 100% agree with it.

741
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,760
 I'm gonna add a little bit more to it.

742
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,200
 One of the things we can do is deepen our roots

743
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,240
 by becoming familiar with God again.

744
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,080
 Absolutely.

745
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,880
 That is what we need to do, persecution,

746
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,360
 and with costly sacrifice.

747
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,360
 But can I add that we need to also become more familiar

748
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,960
 with the purposes of God again?

749
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,040
 Because the slide is this.

750
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,440
 We won't be willing to suffer for what we don't know,

751
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,640
 for what we don't love.

752
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,800
 When we consider these purposes,

753
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,760
 the reconciliation and the restoration of all of humanity

754
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,120
 and all of creation,

755
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,320
 when we consider what God is doing,

756
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,720
 we remember that the waters are uncharted,

757
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,920
 the spaces ahead are uncharted,

758
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,320
 but our God's an open book.

759
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,360
 He's not uncharted.

760
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,760
 He's not the one in question.

761
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,440
 He's known, he's revealed,

762
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,320
 he's made clear who he is and his heart and his purposes.

763
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,360
 And so when we know that,

764
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,360
 there becomes no real fear

765
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,840
 when we sit in uncharted territories.

766
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
 Even in known dangers,

767
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,600
 there's no risk that's too big

768
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,760
 if we remember the purposes behind what God is doing

769
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,360
 in and through us,

770
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,440
 that he is good,

771
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,960
 therefore no price is too steep,

772
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,160
 that he is good,

773
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,960
 that his ways are good,

774
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,040
 that his purposes for all creation is good.

775
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,760
 My heart for all of us here in this room and online

776
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,440
 is that we would consider the worthiness of God

777
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,720
 when we remember his purposes

778
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,440
 and that his purposes would be enough

779
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,920
 to call us to consider

780
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,920
 and to respond to the costly sacrifice of trusting in him.

781
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,000
 That we too can be aligned and so in love

782
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 and so desire to see the fullness of God's kingdom here

783
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,680
 where suffering ends,

784
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,720
 where shame ends,

785
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,240
 where brokenness ends,

786
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,080
 like that is the kingdom

787
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,840
 where full restoration takes place.

788
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,960
 That is what our hearts should long for as his people

789
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,640
 when we remember his purposes.

790
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,720
 And when we remember this,

791
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,520
 we become so in love with it,

792
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,840
 we insist on paying for it because it is valuable.

793
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,480
 It is of great value.

794
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,920
 It is probably the most valuable thing

795
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,240
 this world's gonna see, right?

796
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,840
 We insist on paying for it.

797
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,200
 We will be a people who say,

798
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,080
 we will not sacrifice to the Lord our God,

799
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,240
 a life that costs us nothing.

800
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,240
 We will not give to him what costs us nothing.

801
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,800
 We wanna pay the cost.

802
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,880
 We wanna give all that we have

803
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,800
 because of how beautiful this vision of heaven on earth,

804
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,680
 full restoration, new creation looks like.

805
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:31,760
 I think Ananias could have never imagined

806
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,760
 just how wild, how big, how spread Saul's transformation

807
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,600
 would, what it would do for the gospel.

808
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,000
 I don't think he could ever realize the impact.

809
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,720
 See, he was just faced with a moment,

810
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,080
 with a small moment of examining what he believed

811
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,240
 and where his trust was.

812
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,040
 The transformation of Saul to Paul

813
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,640
 would have not been a result of the sacrifice

814
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,700
 of just knowing things about God,

815
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,520
 just knowing information about Jesus.

816
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,300
 That wouldn't be the costly sacrifice required.

817
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,080
 The costly sacrifice that God required of Ananias

818
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,280
 and today that he's requiring of us

819
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,420
 is belief through obedience.

820
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,620
 Costly sacrifice always calls and leads us to examine

821
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,000
 where it is that we really put our trust in.

822
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,400
 Listen, we can say that we trust Jesus

823
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
 till we're blue in the face,

824
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,760
 until we act in obedience,

825
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,960
 until we do something about that trust,

826
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,340
 until we choose to sacrifice for him.

827
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,720
 It's just words.

828
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,680
 It's just knowledge.

829
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,000
 It's just information.

830
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,200
 See, persecution comes to us all,

831
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,660
 but the idea of costly sacrifice

832
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,160
 is one that we have to choose.

833
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,280
 That's a decision that we have to make

834
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,840
 based off of the belief that we have in him.

835
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,100
 And that is why we have to get to this place

836
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,400
 where our belief isn't simply

837
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,820
 getting more information about God,

838
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,360
 isn't simply sitting in another service,

839
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,840
 isn't simply just knowing stuff.

840
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,880
 We live in an oversaturated world of information.

841
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,360
 There's too much information out there,

842
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,720
 so much information we get sick of information.

843
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,100
 So it's not gonna be information alone

844
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,480
 that's gonna transform us into people

845
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,820
 who live in response to Jesus.

846
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,220
 No, it's gonna be a call to obedience.

847
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,140
 Disciples who trust God must act upon the belief

848
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,000
 and trust that we possess.

849
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,840
 As the band comes up, I wanna read us this quote

850
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,180
 from Dietrich Bonhoeffer,

851
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,540
 someone who I've been reading a lot of recently.

852
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,860
 And he says this, he's so intellectual, he's so smart.

853
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,820
 He uses lots of big words.

854
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,420
 I don't understand half of what he says.

855
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,600
 Took me a long time to make it

856
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,800
 through the first two chapters.

857
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,320
 I'm probably still there.

858
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,960
 But I put it up here so we can read it

859
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,720
 and really think about what he's saying,

860
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
 because this really hit me and stopped me at my core.

861
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,520
 He says this, "With an abstract idea,

862
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,220
 "it is possible to enter into a relation of formal knowledge

863
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,140
 "to become enthusiastic about it,

864
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,380
 "and perhaps even to put it into practice,

865
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,660
 "but it can never be followed in personal obedience.

866
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,780
 "Christianity without the living Christ

867
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,540
 "is inevitably Christianity without discipleship,

868
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,920
 "and Christianity without discipleship

869
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,260
 "is always Christianity without Christ."

870
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:19,300
 To follow, to be a disciple of Jesus in uncharted spaces,

871
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,820
 we have to be a people who more than just agree

872
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,640
 on the information that's out there about Jesus,

873
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,340
 but rather people who are willing to choose

874
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,920
 to respond with sacrificial trust,

875
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,920
 even when it costs us dearly.

876
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:39,180
 My question is, where is your trust today?

877
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,380
 What have we been adhering to?

878
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,500
 What decisions are we willing to make

879
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,980
 should God call us into a challenging situation?

880
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,040
 What is it that we follow?

881
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,820
 Are we leaning too much on the other options

882
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,260
 of discipleship, right?

883
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
 Are we leaning on the other ways,

884
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,060
 the other things like our observations?

885
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,220
 Do we follow favorable circumstances so much

886
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,700
 that we become risk adverse to following Jesus

887
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,700
 if he says it's gonna hurt a little bit?

888
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,620
 Are we leaning too much on our own understanding?

889
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,060
 Are there things that hinder us

890
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,860
 from actively following Jesus,

891
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,580
 no matter where he's calling us?

892
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,380
 The good thing is that if he goes there,

893
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,040
 then that means if we follow him there, he's still there,

894
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,180
 so we're good, right?

895
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
 Like if Jesus is there, then we have hope,

896
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,420
 then we have peace,

897
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,140
 and we have all the things that we need.

898
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,100
 So following Jesus,

899
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,780
 it doesn't matter how charted and uncharted it is.

900
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,380
 If Jesus is gonna be there, that's where you wanna be,

901
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,340
 right?

902
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,180
 Trust me, that's, if Jesus is in that situation,

903
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,180
 then I wanna be in that situation 'cause I know who he is.

904
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:58,820
 So my prayer for us this morning, church,

905
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,160
 is that we would be reminded of the purposes of God,

906
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,100
 of his kingdom come, what it looks like on the earth today,

907
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,380
 that we would be reminded of all the good and all the life,

908
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,360
 all the fullness that he brings with his kingdom

909
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,540
 that he has inaugurated already,

910
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,880
 and that it would lead us to a place of deeper surrender,

911
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,140
 a place where our trust leads us to costly sacrifice,

912
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,740
 where we would be willing to offer our bodies

913
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,340
 as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing and acceptable

914
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,220
 unto the Lord as an act of worship in views of God mercy.

915
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,020
 Would we be willing to respond?

916
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,260
 I ask you to go ahead and stand and we'll pray together.

917
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,160
 Jesus, we recognize that discipleship

918
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,940
 is not an easy thing per se.

919
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,660
 God, we recognize that there are voices

920
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,820
 that are sometimes come across as louder than you.

921
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,100
 Our fears can be louder, our reason can be louder,

922
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,280
 the conditions of the direction you've called us into

923
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,660
 can sometimes be louder.

924
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,220
 But God, I pray supernaturally,

925
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,540
 would you tune our ears to only hear you?

926
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:13,420
 Would you fix our eyes to be fixed upon you alone?

927
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,920
 God, that no matter how challenging, no matter how hard,

928
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,540
 no matter what risk or what cost,

929
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,540
 Jesus, may we choose to decide that today we will follow you.

930
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,580
 We will follow you no matter how hard it is,

931
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,900
 no matter how easy it is, from green pastures into valleys.

932
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,340
 Lord, may we be a people who are committed to following you.

933
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,820
 And where we don't have that strength,

934
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,520
 Holy Spirit, would you strengthen our feet?

935
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,580
 Would you strengthen our minds, God?

936
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,700
 Would you protect us against the overthinking,

937
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,760
 against the doubt, against the fears

938
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,380
 that take us away from you?

939
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,460
 When our senses pull us further away from you,

940
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,180
 Jesus, would you be everything?

941
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,900
 Would you lead us so that we will truly follow you?

942
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,540
 Jesus. Amen.
