[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.000]   Everyone says, "Amen." Hey, can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Why don't you have a seat? Have a seat.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   [Music]
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Right. Half of you in here know exactly what that's all about.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   The other half of you have no idea what's going on.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I'm in that second group who has no idea what's going on.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   We're starting an amazing new series here called Blowing Water.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   It's a series that's been birthed and shaped by Pastor Ellison
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   as he's prayed over us as a church and wondered what the summer is going to be like.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We're so excited that he's here today to open up the series for us.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Can we put our hands together as we welcome Ellison?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Hi.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Hi, bud.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Let's stretch out our hands and let's pray.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Father, we thank you for Ellison, for Brittany, for Isaiah, for Malachi,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   for this family that you've blessed this church with for many years now.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Father, thank you for just Ellison's heart, his passion to communicate the gospel
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   in ways that are challenging and yet hopeful,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and for the way in which you've put this series on his heart for the summer
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   where we look at the conversations that Jesus had with lots of different types of people.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Father, as he opens up this word, Lord, we pray for that fertile soil in our hearts,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   that we would hear your word, Lord, that you'd speak to us and shape us and mold us
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   into the people that you desire us to be.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Father, we thank you so much for this, and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Everyone says amen.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Amen. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, team.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Good morning to those of you joining us online.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   So, as Andrew said, over the past couple of months, we've been walking through Exodus as a journey.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We've been visiting Egypt through film, seeing all the sites,
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and learned about how God has powerfully been moving his people in his rescue plan,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   out of slavery into freedom.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   If you've missed some of those messages, I encourage you to go back to YouTube,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   look them up, get caught up so you can start back together with us
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   when we start back later this summer.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But for the coming weeks, as Andrew said, we're going to be entering into a new series.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   So we're taking a break from Exodus, so you can think of it as like Exodus season one is over.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   There's a little hiatus. Season two is coming soon.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But today, we're stepping into our new summer sermon series.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   We're calling this series Blowing Water, as you see in Chou Sui,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   probably the most Hong Kong title you could give a sermon series.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But let me explain to you why.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Blowing Water is a direct translation for the Cantonese slang phrase, "chou sui."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   To "chou sui" or to "blow water" means to have a chit-chat or conversation with someone.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   For example, this morning, as I was stopped by at 7-Eleven, I got caught.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I was late to work because the guy was trying to talk to me about my YUU points.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And we got on this whole thing about, you know,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   "Li koi yi yong chun ba da tong," and all this kind of stuff.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Link your YUU account to your Octopus card, and you don't have to put out your...
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It was like a 10-minute conversation about YUU.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   But yeah, that was a conversation.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Or maybe when you ride in a taxi or go to the market,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   whoever it is that you encounter, if you stop for a minute to have a chat,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   you can say, "Lei tong ga dei chui ha sui," right?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Imagine like saliva being blown at your mouth.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's kind of gross, I know, okay?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I think that's the idea.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   But a little while ago, I got a random message from a unknown number.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   We've all been getting these a lot recently, right?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And the way this person started the conversation was,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   "Hi, hai wo, yong mo shi gan chui ha sui?"
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   "Hey, it's me. Do you have time for a chat?"
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Now, my curiosity peaked.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Because most normal people, most normal people would have said to themselves,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   "Don't know this number, right? Spam, report, block, move on," okay?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Most normal people.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I, however, was on a long bus ride home.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I had all the time in the world, right?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So I decided to engage.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I decided to reply to see where this conversation would go.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   "Oh, hi, sorry. Who are you?"
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And then the guy replied, "Oh, it's me, Walson. Aunty Chan's son."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   "Oh, yeah, I remember, Walson. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How are you?"
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Right, and so for the next 45 minutes, actually, in fact, for the next couple of weeks,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   it started to get a bit weird, so I stopped, okay?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   But I pretended to be Jenny, okay?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   A middle-aged sales lady who recently had her heart broken
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   because my pet cat just died.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   My boyfriend broke up with me. I didn't know what to do with my life, right?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And it turned into this really fascinating conversation, okay?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   If you look through messages, it's weird, okay?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But he was trying to be kind this whole time.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   He was trying to be comforting, a little bit creepy.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But I knew where this was heading, right?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   This was heading towards him asking me for money, right?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   This was a scammer, right?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They're trying to use this conversation to build trust,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   to build a relationship.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   In the end, they probably asked for money or credit card, something like that.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Now, if you look in the news lately, right,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   so many stories about people being duped or tricked, swindled, and convinced
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   out of large amounts of money precisely because of conversations
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   like the one I had with Walson, right?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Over $1 billion have been lost through scams, apparently.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And make me think, why?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, I think it's because conversations are powerful, right?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   We crave connection through conversation.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   In fact, I would say conversations are essential in how we build relationships
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   with each other.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Conversations have the ability to stir our emotions, to comfort us,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   to make us weep, to make us laugh, to motivate us to do good or to do bad.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And this is why these scams work so well, simply because these people
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   are good at conversing, right?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   They're so compelling.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Think back to some conversations you might have had.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Maybe sadly you've been a victim of one of these scams and you've lost money
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and lost other resources because of this.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Maybe it's a tough conversation you had with your boss.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Maybe it was bringing bad news to someone that you loved.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Or maybe it's staying on the phone with your crush till 3 AM saying,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   "You hang up. No, you hang up. No, you hang up."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I'm looking at you, Bernice.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   My conversation is this, right?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   The right conversation can leave a deep impact and maybe even change
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   our lives altogether.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Right?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   One of the most memorable, impactful conversations that comes to mind
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   was when I called my wife, Brittany, when I called her mom to ask
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   for her permission to ask if I could propose to her daughter, right?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It was through the phone because she lives in the US, but my hands were shaky,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   my palms were setting.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I remember stumbling over my words, and in the end, she gave me the blessing.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Now I think about it really quickly for some reason, okay?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But that conversation has had an impact on my life for the rest of my life.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So this made me think also, "Well, who is it that's the master of conversation?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Who left people wondering where did this person receive their power, wisdom,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   and authority from every time after talking to them?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Who was the person that could literally set people free from the suffering
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   with just the power of his words?"
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   This, of course, is Jesus.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And so over the coming weeks, we're going to be looking at conversations
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Jesus had with different people.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And as we look at these conversations, hopefully what we will find is some
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   new and fresh perspectives.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   We draw out truths and insights you may not have noticed before.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And I hope that with each conversation we look at, we'll also hear Jesus speak
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   to our doubts, our fears, our failings, our sorrows, our setbacks,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   our insecurities, and challenge us to live a life more in line with his purposes.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   At the same time, by examining these dialogues, I hope that we can learn
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   to engage in authentic life-altering conversations with those around us
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that lead people and point people to where Jesus is.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Because one thing's for sure, everyone who spoke with Jesus left forever changed.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And so when we too are motivated by the love of Jesus, the power of God,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, our conversations too can have the same
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   impact as those around us.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So we're going to start in John 8.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   It says this, "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts where all the people gathered
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   around him, and he sat down to teach them.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, 'Teacher,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such woman.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Now what do you say?'"
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   They were using this as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "But Jesus went down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   'Let one who is without sin be the first to throw the stone at her.'
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground, 'And at this,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   those who heard began to walk away one at a time,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   the older ones first until only Jesus was left.'
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   With the woman still standing there, Jesus straightened up and asked her,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?'
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   'No one, sir,' she said. 'Then neither do I condemn you,' Jesus declared.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   'Go now and leave your life of sin.'"
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   This is a very well-known story in the New Testament.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   However, if you read it in your Bible, you might see there's a little side note.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   The problem is that in some early manuscripts of what we have as the Scriptures right now,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   this story isn't present in there.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Scholars think it's a bit out of place. It doesn't fit in with the context before and after.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Without going into too much detail, though, the general consensus is that
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   even if those problems exist, we can still trust that it's an accurate account,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   reliable enough for us to study and to preach on.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And if you really want to get into asking more questions about the scholarliness of the Ovilette,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   send me an email. I'll forward it to Andrew, and he can tell you all about it, okay?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   So let's go back to the passage and take a deeper look.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Verse 2, "At dawn, He appeared again in the temple court,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   where all the people were gathered around Him, and He sat down to teach them."
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And often when we think about Jesus' ministry, we think about the things He did.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   The miracles, walking on water, feeding the 5,000, healing the sick, turning water into wine.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   There's a lot going on in the life and activity of Jesus.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   But when we look at the book of John specifically,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   the focus isn't so much on Jesus' actions and His activities, but rather it's Jesus' words.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Right? Not surprising, since the book of John starts by describing Jesus as "the Word becoming flesh."
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   So here we have Jesus sitting in the court, using His words to teach a group of people around Him,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   a common occurrence through the Gospels.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   It tells us all the people were gathered around Him.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   The fact is that Jesus was attracting a crowd of all sorts of people, maybe a bit like this right now.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   This is important to take a note of, because it meant that Jesus' popularity was rising,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   much to the anger, of course, of the religious authorities at the time.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   In fact, by this time in His ministry, there were already people trying to kill Jesus
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   because of the things He was saying and teaching.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   He was saying things like, "I am the bread of life that came down from heaven.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   So to them, this was blasphemy.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   How dare Jesus say words like this?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   How dare He claim Himself to be God?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Jesus, however, continued to meet and teach in public in order to declare the truth of who He was,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   who His Father was, what He came here to do, despite the threats that He was receiving.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   One thing that hopefully you will notice throughout the series is that the reason why Jesus was so impactful
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   in His conversations He has with people is because He is always fully confident
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   and fully obedient in His calling and His identity.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   He never wavers when He's challenged.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   He doesn't back down even if people are threatening Him, even if they're threatening to kill Him.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   At the same time, though, He isn't arrogant or self-righteous.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   He simply stands firm on the foundation of truth.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So this made me think, "What about the conversations I have with people about Jesus?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Am I always able to stand firm in my belief of Him as my Savior?"
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's hard to do sometimes because talking about Jesus and the things He did sounds weird, right?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Some of the things He did are almost--I mean, they sound unbelievable.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And so either I avoid talking about Him because I don't want to face those sort of difficult and weird conversations,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   or when I get challenged about it, I start to be shy and I start to waver, change the topic, or something like that.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Ask yourself this question this morning.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Is my life, are my convictions built upon the foundation of Jesus?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Because if they're not, then every time we're challenged about Him,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   every time we are asked a difficult question, we might buckle.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   We might sway to the left or to the right.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   We may give in to people's fears, and that never leaves much room for a good conversation.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Church, the first challenge this morning is to be confident in our faith
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   because if not, our conversations will never display a living faith.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   We cannot communicate something that's not first inside of us.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Therefore, if we want to have conversations about Jesus, we must be strongly rooted in our love and our belief of Him.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   So Jesus is there.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   He's teaching the crowds when He is dramatically and rudely interrupted.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   It says, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   We had her stand before the group and said to Jesus, 'Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such woman.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Now, what do you say?'"
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Being interrupted is really annoying, right?
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   If I was Jesus, I'd be mad.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Being interrupted, it's just--it's frustrating, it's annoying.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Maybe if you have young children or toddlers, you understand what I'm saying, right?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   My son, Isaiah, sweetest kid, will not shut up, okay?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Especially when I'm doing something, okay?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I could be in the middle of doing nothing, sitting down, you know, minding my own business.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   The moment I try to talk on the phone or I want to talk with Brittany, he starts bombarding me with questions, right?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   "Hey, dada, can elephant roll down hills?"
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   "Hey, dada, can you build a long train track with me?"
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   "Hey, dada, hey, dada, hey, dada, why didn't you talk to me two minutes ago?"
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Anyway, so here's Jesus teaching when He's suddenly interrupted.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   What's His reaction going to be?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I think the way Jesus handles Himself here proves some good groundwork for the way we can approach situations like this in our conversations.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   As we're about to discover, even though the situation was loud and tense and complicated, very shocking,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Jesus stays calm and confident.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   They bring this woman caught in adultery.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   They make her stand before the group.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Now, let's take a sidestep for a moment and just put yourself in the position of this woman.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Imagine what she must have been feeling.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Right, firstly, the fact that she was caught in the act of adultery would probably be embarrassing enough.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Then she's forcibly brought before a group of strangers, publicly shamed with a sin laid bare for everyone to know about what she just did.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   It would have been terrifying.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Imagine that happening to you right now.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   When I read this passage, though, it reminded me of another time when Jesus was teaching and He was interrupted.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   This is almost the same situation but with some big differences.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   A group of men drag a friend in front of Jesus.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Jesus is teaching in this house when suddenly the roof is ripped open and four friends lower a paralytic man down before the feet of Jesus.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And he's interrupted again in the middle of His teaching.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   But in this situation, Jesus notices the faith of these men.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And He heals the paralytic man so he could walk again.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   The motivations of these men was full of hope and full of faith.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Right, they knew of Jesus' reputation as someone who was kind and compassionate and forgiving.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And they thought, "If only we bring our friend before Jesus, then He'll be able to heal him."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But in this situation, the circumstances are almost like same, same but different, right?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   The Pharisees may not have brought this woman, right?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   She might not have been physically sick, but she needed help nonetheless.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But their motivations in bringing her to Jesus were not to seek for her healing, for her forgiveness.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   It's clear that these men were out for blood.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I mean, they already announced a death sentence over her.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   They were not interested in redemption.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   They were looking at an opportunity for condemnation.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   But what's even more than this is that actually John tells us this situation was a double-edged sword
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   because the Pharisees were really just using this woman to get to Jesus.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   I mean, if this was really about the law and about being zealous about punishing this woman,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   this was something that could actually have been probably handled in private, right?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   They could have brought her in without anybody else around and just dealt with it themselves.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   If this was really addressing about the sin of adultery, then where was the man in this situation?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Shouldn't he have been brought before the people as well?
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   It takes two people to do something like this.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And so the fact that the man is not presently doing this publicly
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   is just further proof that this whole scene was simply a setup.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   The woman was something they were willing to use and to abuse in order to catch Jesus.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   It tells us this very clearly.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Well, accuse him of what?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Well, from their perspective, they have Jesus perfectly between a rock and a hard place.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   It's because they know of Jesus'--like we said just now,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   he has a reputation for being kind and compassionate and forgiving.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   They were wanting to use this against him.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   They're probably thinking Jesus was going to say something like, "Hey, fellas, okay, okay, come on now.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   You know what I'm about. I'm about peace and love and forgiveness.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Why don't we just let her go? Let her be free."
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   If Jesus had said something like that, then they would have been able to accuse him
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   of directly going against God's law, calling him a blasphemer,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and that he too should be punished with death as well.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   On the other hand, if Jesus had said something like, "Yes, you guys are right.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   This is what the law says. She is condemned to death.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Come on, guys, let's go and stone her,"
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   then his reputation for being kind and loving and compassionate would have been ruined.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And in addition to this, the Pharisees could then accuse him of revolting against the Roman government
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   because technically speaking, they were the only ones that were able to hand out death sentences to people.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   But these religious leaders have got it twisted.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   They've missed the point.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   They've taken the ideas of justice and mercy and pitched them against each other as enemies.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   And ironically, they failed to realize that the true definition of justice and mercy
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   was standing right before them.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   These religious leaders were carrying the attitude of what Jesus was talking about in Matthew 23,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   where they shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   They've neglected the more important matters of the law, justice, mercy, and faithfulness.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And church, this is a reminder this morning for us too.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   The story of the woman probes our own reflexes towards people who do not fit in into our expectations.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I know, in fact, that there's probably a number of people here who've been through what this woman is going through.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Maybe not with adultery or something like that, right?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   But what I mean is that during a time of struggling,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   during a time when you were wrestling with your sin and your suffering and your shame,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   and the reaction you got when people found out was not to help you to heal,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   but rather it was shame and condemnation.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Maybe that's even happened to you here in this community at the Vine.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And if that's the case, it should break our hearts and it should lead us to do better.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And church, when we approach those who seem to be lost in sin,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   when we have conversations with those who don't fit our expectations,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   who are struggling with darkness,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   when we're trying to guide people in the journey of exodus out of their slavery into freedom,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   what does our language sound like?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Are we judgmental? Are we self-righteous?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Are we far too excited when we get an opportunity to point out the speck in someone else's eye
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   without looking at the log that is in our own eye?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Because if so, conversations we have with people in this space are never going to be effective.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   So how does Jesus react?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Well, in true Jesus fashion, it wasn't like anybody expected Him to.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   John continues to tell us this.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   As they were questioning Him and questioning Him and questioning Him,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with His finger.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Now, I like to think of myself as a good listener.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Brittany, my wife, however, would probably tell you I'm not.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   One of the reasons she doesn't think I'm a good listener is because it never appears as though I'm listening.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   She could be in the middle of telling me about something, weekend plans,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   something that happened at work, meal prepping, whatever.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I don't really listen to what she's saying, right?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   But, okay, in the middle of her talking to me, I will often randomly get up and try to go and do something else, right?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Like maybe clean up a mess with the toys or fix the bookshelf or something like that, okay?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And because I'm doing something else at the same time, it seems like I'm not listening.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   I reassure, yes, I am actually listening.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It's just that my mind gets easily distracted and it helps if I'm doing something else whilst listening to her at the same time.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And it seems as though this is what's happening here.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   They're berating Jesus with questions and it doesn't seem like Jesus is listening at all.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Instead, he starts doing something completely random.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   They kept on questioning him.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   "Jesus, hello, did you hear us? What are you doing? What do you say? What do you say about this situation?"
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Jesus is unfazed.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   He stays chill. He stays calm.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   He concentrates on what he's writing on the ground.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And we don't really know. If you read commentaries, there's going to be a bunch of theories.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   What was he actually writing on the ground?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   We don't know, right?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   But the effect it had was providing a pause in a tense moment.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Jesus stays calm. He pauses. He thinks. And then he speaks.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Right? In the middle of being berated by questions, being attacked, his reaction is not to shout or to yell, to try and put out fire with fire.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I know often this is my own reaction.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   When the volume gets loud, you try to match it.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   When tempers get flared, you feel like you have to stick up for yourself.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Many times this happens perhaps in less proud moments of parenting,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   maybe in a heated conversation between you and your spouse or your partner, your parents or work colleagues.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   But think about it this way.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   When was the last time a shouting match led to a good conversation for you?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   When was the last time someone opened up to you after you yelled at them?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Jesus demonstrates a different model for us to follow.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   He takes on the wisdom of Proverbs.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   A fool gives full vent to a spirit, but a wise man or woman quietly holds it back.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Church, if we really want to be able to dialogue with each other in this space,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   we must learn to be able to hold our tongue, to keep cool, even when we might be bombarded with accusations and questions.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Pausing, thinking, and then speaking could be a fundamental way for us to prevent our conversations from going sideways.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And we learn to speak from a place of calm and peace.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   That might mean practicing a bit of deep breathing.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   In for four, hold for seven, out for eight.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   In for four, hold for seven, out for eight.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   That might mean asking yourself, you know, "How would I like to be talked to if I was in this situation?"
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Sometimes this might even be walking away to clear your head, right, before coming back to the conversation.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Whatever it is, find the thing that works for you to pause, to think, and then speak.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Jesus does this perfectly.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And as a result, he gives the perfect answer to this situation.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Listen to what he says.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   "When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said, 'Let any of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.'"
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Again, he stooped down and kept writing on the ground.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   If there was a list of top ten mic drop moments in Scripture, right, this would probably be one of them.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   The perfect answer to this situation.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Why?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Well, remember, this whole thing was actually a setup in order to catch Jesus, try and catch Jesus saying the wrong thing.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   But this was the perfect answer because, first of all, it didn't deny the law, right?
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   He doesn't say, "Don't throw the stone at her," but at the same time, he doesn't say, "What the woman done is okay. Just let her go."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   The fact is, this woman has sinned.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And there were indeed laws that say that people who have been caught in adultery should be put to death.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Leviticus 20.10, Deuteronomy 22.22.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   So if we were to paraphrase Jesus' answer, he's saying, "Okay, yeah, go ahead. Judge this woman.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   You can throw a stone at her, but before you do that, judge yourself first."
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   What Jesus is able to do with his answer is see right through the motivations of these religious leaders.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   He struck at their hearts, forces them to examine themselves.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And as self-righteous as these religious leaders were, none of them would have been bold enough to say that they were perfect and without sin.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   And so they're stunned into silence.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   You see, church, a strong answer doesn't have to be loud.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   It doesn't have to be harsh or even forceful.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Like we said before, all Jesus does is stand firm on the truth.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   All he does is point to the truth.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   He doesn't yell. He doesn't shout. He doesn't bash people with Scripture.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   It's not even a long conversation that Jesus has with these religious leaders.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   He doesn't get drawn into a big, long debate about him.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   It's not a loud, angry exchange, but with some gentle yet powerful words.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Just like when Jesus calmed the storm on the sea, Jesus brings a calm to this hectic situation.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   And from being a group that were badgering this woman, ready to sentence her to death,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   suddenly they have nothing to say and begin walking away.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   They walked away because they know that they too would be just as guilty of punishment were they to throw a stone at this woman.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   So at this, those who heard began to walk away one at a time,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   the older ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman standing still there.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Jesus had escaped the death, saved the woman from death and escaped the trap set for him.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Every single woman who came for this woman had a change of heart.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   These people had come to shame the woman, to shame Jesus,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   but now they were the ones who had to hang their heads in shame and walk away.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And after everyone had left, Jesus can finally fully focus on this woman that was being brought before the Pharisees.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   The word "left" here is quite interesting. It's not just "leave."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Actually, in the Greek, it's actually got a strong connotation of being "abandoned."
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   So this woman had now been left alone and abandoned.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   She was useless to the Pharisees now, the plan didn't work, so they left her.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Everyone else had left her, but not Jesus.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   See, Jesus refuses to abandon her.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   In St. Augustine, he summarizes this scene beautifully when he talks about this passage in Scripture.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "There in the quiet of the mountain, two were left,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   she standing in the misery of her sin, and he standing in the glory of his mercy."
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   You see, it's only when the environment becomes safe and calm
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   that Jesus finally gets a chance to have a conversation with this woman.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   And again, it's a short conversation, but it's beautiful and challenging.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   With the threats and distractions out of the way, Jesus is able to commune with her.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   Because he knew that before he needed to communicate anything with her,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   he first needed to commune with her, to look her face to face, to acknowledge her as a person.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Has no one condemned you?" "No one, sir," she said.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   You see, where the religious leaders treated this woman with shame and condemnation,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Jesus treats this woman with love and respect.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   When Jesus says "woman," it's not like, "Woman!" You know, it's not like that, okay?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   But it's actually a very—gosh, I'm sorry—it's actually a very courteous way,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   the most kind way he could have addressed her.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   This was Jesus' way of letting her know, "Hey, it's okay.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Everyone else is gone, but I'm still here.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   You're safe now. I'm here for you."
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   This is an important point for us to keep in mind when we're trying to have conversations with people
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   about tough things, because if people don't feel safe, they're not going to open up.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   And our role as people who point people towards Jesus, we must be able to create safe environments
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   for people to truly able to talk about their struggles, their sin, their fears, their darkness,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   without them thinking that they might be condemned.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   And one great way we can do this is share out of our own brokenness and our own vulnerability,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   because when we do this, we let people know we're just the same.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Everyone in this room, everyone in this world battles with sin,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   and we all need to bring our sin before Jesus.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   But when we let people see our journey, that's truly one of the best gifts we can give to someone,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   to commune with someone, to get to know them before we try and communicate anything with them,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   to embrace their brokenness and vulnerability, to embrace your own brokenness and vulnerability
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   as a point of connection, and as they open up to you, to let them know that they're loved,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   to let them know that they belong.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   This is why Jesus' response is so powerful.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   He says to her, "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   "Go now and leave your life of sin."
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   The only person who could have given her the death sentence,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   the only person who have technically picked up a stone to throw at her,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   the person who truly had the authority to condemn her has told her she is not condemned.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   The Pharisees notice the sin and see it as an opportunity to judge and to trap.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Jesus notices the sin and sees it as an opportunity to love, to forgive, to show mercy,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   to give a new life.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Now, please don't get me wrong. Jesus is not excusing her sin at all.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   When Jesus says, "Neither do I condemn you," He's not saying, "It's okay. Just go. I don't care."
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   No, Jesus wants this woman to help this woman see that the situation was serious.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   She has literally been rescued for imminent death.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   But He also wants her to know that now you are free.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   The sin that held you back, the sin that held you in bondage, no longer has any power over you.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And now you have a new lease, a new way to live your life.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   You see, what's amazing is that this woman doesn't really know who Jesus is yet.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   She doesn't know that Jesus is on this mission to the cross.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   She doesn't know what this woman doesn't know in that moment that He loved her so much.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   He was going to take on that condemnation that was due for her.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   He was going to sacrifice Himself to death so that she wouldn't have to.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   That's the only way that she could have been forgiven.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   So, yes, Jesus offers forgiveness. Jesus forgives.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   But we must also remember that forgiveness is a costly thing and that we can never treat it lightly.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Forgiveness came at the cost of Jesus' life, which means that if we are to receive that forgiveness,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   it should also come with a change in our lives.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Jesus lets this woman know she is loved, sinful yet forgiven.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Then and only then does the conversation turn towards asking her to change.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Go now and leave your life of sin.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   It's not just a quaint word. It's not just a cute ending to the story.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   But it's a deep challenge for the woman now to live by.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   It demonstrates the forgiving spirit of Jesus and His firm call to live a transformed life.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Jesus is telling her that she can start a life anew.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   But the motivation He's doing that is not through shame, guilt, and condemnation.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   It's through the full depth of His love and forgiveness.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And Scripture doesn't tell us what happened next to this woman.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   But what I like to think is that if she really had been impacted by Jesus in this moment,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   in this short little conversation,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   she probably went on to live a life that was marked forever by His love and His mercy.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   So where does that leave us?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Well, in this room right now, we too are not perfect people. Far from it, in fact.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And so therefore, this community needs to be a place where we can put down self-righteousness
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   so that we can enter into conversations with each other when we're struggling with sin and darkness.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And we don't need to yell. We don't need to berate. We don't need to condemn.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   This story proves that often it's the kind, the loving conversations,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   the ones that confidently but gently point people towards Jesus
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   that become the most effective ones we can have with others.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   It shows us that when we allow for Jesus to calm the noise and to lead the conversation,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   that's when lives are changed.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   When we make space for God in the conversation, He always, always appears to us.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   So this community needs to be a place where anyone who's struggling with sin
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   can become part of the community and be led to the one who can truly heal and forgive.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   And often we might find that as we walk and talk with God to others,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   they too begin to start their own conversations with God.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   God begins to speak to them in ways, amazing ways, that you never could if it was just done by your own power.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   So church, in the coming weeks, as we continue to look at the conversations that Jesus has,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   as we continue to discover how He engages and speaks with people,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   I hope that this would be our starting point.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   May we be a people, may we be a church that speaks truth and love in the darkness
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   with the love and mercy of Jesus.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Would you close your eyes, church? I'm just going to pray for us for a minute.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   This is our hope, this is our goal, to be this kind of church,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   to be the kind of people that have these kind of conversations.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And perhaps you're in here this morning and you think, "Oh, actually, you know what?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I've been quite angry lately."
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   And even in my own zealousness to bring people to realize who Jesus is,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   maybe perhaps you've realized you've let anger dictate your words.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   You haven't taken the time to pause, to think before speaking out.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And Jesus is here to remind you, to show you, "I appreciate your heart,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   but maybe it's time to let go of the anger and embrace my approach.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Take on my mercy and impart that to others.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Love as I did, and let others know that they are safe,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   that they don't need to fear your judgment when you open your mouth to talk to them."
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Maybe you're in this space and you have used your words to condemn others,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   and you're realizing, "Oh, yeah, those words were hurtful.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   I shouldn't have said those things."
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Just allow the Spirit of God, the mercy of Jesus to wash over you too,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   to help you in your further conversations.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Maybe you're in this room and you're feeling like that woman,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   and you've been hurt so much.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Yes, there are things you know that you're ashamed of, perhaps.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   An area of sin, of addiction, of something that had a grip on you,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   and you've tried to talk to people,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   but it's often been met with scorn and scolding.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   You just don't feel safe. You don't feel like, "Oh, you know, if this is the case,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   why should I even bother talking to anybody?"
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   If you felt condemnation in this way,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   know this morning that Jesus doesn't condemn you either,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   but He wants to draw you in.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   He too wants to give His mercy and forgiveness to you also.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And as you encounter the true love of Jesus, His gentle yet strong heart,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   I pray that you would be led out of your freedom,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   the chains that hold you, the bondage of darkness,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   and led into a life with Jesus guiding the way,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   a transformed, a renewed life.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   And so, Lord, this is our prayer.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Our words are powerful.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   Conversations are a gift that you've given to us,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   and we can either use it to hurt or to heal.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   And so, Jesus, may the words that come out of our mouth
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   be drenched by your Spirit, Lord.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   May the conversations we have about you be full of grace and mercy and wisdom.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And as we do this, continue to shape and mold us to the people,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   to the community, to the families that we need to be
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   to show your love to the world around us.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   We pray in your beautiful name, Lord. Amen.
