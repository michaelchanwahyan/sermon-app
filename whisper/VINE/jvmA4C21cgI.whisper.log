[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Welcome to Online Sunday Service
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.400]   Welcome to the Online Sunday Service
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.600]   We hope you are watching this safely at home
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.600]   Worshipping with us during this typhoon
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.680]   We hope you are watching this safely at home
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.280]   Worshipping with us during this typhoon
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.580]   My name is Chapman
[00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.280]   I am one of the pastors here at the Vineyard Long
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.780]   I am Chapman
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.420]   We have a very special guest speaker
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.420]   to share the Word of God with us
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.660]   We do have a very special guest speaker
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.160]   sharing the Word of God with us
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.560]   His name is Alex Forte
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.100]   He is the Executive Director of Branches of Hope
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100]   Alex is a pastor from the Hope Foundation
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.600]   So let me pray for us
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.600]   as we open our hearts and open our ears
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.480]   to listen to the message that Alex is about to bring us
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.480]   Let's pray together
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   God, please open our lives
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.820]   open our ears
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.820]   and bring the message through Alex
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820]   to change our lives
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.820]   Father, we pray that as we open our hearts
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.820]   you would come and change our lives
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.820]   you would come and transform our hearts
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.820]   through the message that Alex is about to bring
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.820]   In Jesus' name we pray
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.820]   In Jesus' name we pray
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820]   Amen
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820]   Good morning everyone
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820]   My name is Alex
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.820]   I am the Executive Director at Branches of Hope
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820]   For those of you who might not be familiar
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.820]   with who we are
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.820]   We are the NGO founded by the Vine Church
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820]   some 13 years ago now
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.820]   We serve refugees, asylum seekers
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.820]   as well as people who have experienced
[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820]   situations of human trafficking
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.820]   and labor exploitation
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.820]   Our mission is to restore the dignity
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.820]   justice and hope
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.820]   of these people through the
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820]   three pillars of our service
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.820]   Care, empowerment
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.820]   and social awareness
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.820]   Now, you might be wondering
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.820]   why you're listening to me today
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.820]   Actually I'm here as a matter of
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.820]   tradition if you will
[00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.820]   Over the years, the Vine Church
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.820]   has dedicated one Sunday a year
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.820]   to Branches of Hope
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.820]   and this has more recently become
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820]   known as BOH Sunday
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.820]   In fact, we had BOH Sunday at the Vine
[00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.820]   Wanchai just two weeks ago
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.820]   at which Taz gave a beautiful message
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.820]   on Agape, the
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.820]   love of God, and Cheri served
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.820]   on the worship team
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.820]   For us, it's a way to connect
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.820]   with a wider congregation at the Vine Church
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.820]   Church members like yourselves
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.820]   are our most important
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.820]   supporters and partners
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.820]   and so in keeping with this established
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.820]   tradition and retaining our connection
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820]   to the wider Vine community
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.820]   this is our third BOH Sunday
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.820]   at Yuen Long
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820]   We would love to be there and see you all
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.820]   face to face and weather permitting
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.820]   we'll come up to visit you very very soon
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.820]   Let's dive right
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.820]   into today's message
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.820]   by letting me ask you all
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.820]   a question
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.820]   I'd like you to think about your families
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.820]   your places of work
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.820]   anywhere where you spend a significant
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.820]   amount of your time
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.820]   in the presence of others
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.820]   Now, here's the question
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.820]   Does anything come to mind, any situation
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.820]   any relationship, any rule
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.820]   that you think isn't fair
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.820]   just isn't right
[00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.820]   Think about it for a moment
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.820]   Now, let me specify
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.820]   my question
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.820]   Does anything come to mind
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.820]   that is unfair to others?
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.820]   Let's be honest
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.820]   when I asked the question initially
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.820]   without specifying who to think of
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.820]   most of us, and I count myself
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.820]   I include myself in this of course
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.820]   would have been inclined to have thought about ourselves
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.820]   Maybe
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.820]   the thought that came to your mind was that
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820]   annoying thing your family member does
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.820]   over and over again
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.820]   or your thought was the last minute assignment
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.820]   that your boss or teacher gave you
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.820]   or maybe you thought about the bus driver
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.820]   who, even though he could see you running
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.820]   and waving, still closed the doors
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.820]   on you
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.820]   So how does it change your thinking?
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.820]   How does it change your
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.820]   posture when I ask
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.820]   you to consider this question on behalf
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.820]   of somebody else?
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.820]   What does this say about your role in society
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.820]   and, more importantly
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.820]   in God's kingdom?
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.820]   Today, as part
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.820]   four of the Stewarding Our Lives sermon series
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.820]   we will take a look at becoming
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.820]   a restorative presence
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.820]   Often, we struggle
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.820]   to connect our faith and our work
[00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.820]   Our work, paid
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.820]   or unpaid, in the home or in the office
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.820]   outside
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.820]   consumes a huge part of our lives
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.820]   Many times, the main way
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.820]   that we connect our faith and our work
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.820]   are in a few simple ways. For example
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.820]   earning money to give to God's kingdom
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.820]   sharing the gospel
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.820]   in the workplace, or just
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.820]   being ethical at work
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.820]   While these three ways of
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.820]   connecting our faith to our
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.820]   workplace hold true and are important
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.820]   what I hope to do today is to provide
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.820]   a deeper, biblical understanding
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.820]   of the purpose that God has
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.820]   for us in our work
[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.820]   I'm particularly
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.820]   grateful to Pastor Tim to
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.820]   providing us the stage and suggesting
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.820]   this particular day and topic
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.820]   as one to center BOH Sunday in Yuen Long
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.820]   around. Indeed, I'd like to think
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.820]   that as an organization
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.820]   or at an institutional level, Branches of Hope
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.820]   is a restorative presence
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.820]   to the community that we serve
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.820]   and as an organization
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.820]   we offer an avenue to channel
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.820]   and amplify the restorative presence
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.820]   of others. But before
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.820]   we get into that in more detail
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.820]   let's open this week's scripture passage
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.820]   Turn with me, if you will
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.820]   please, to the book of Acts
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.820]   chapter 6, verses 1
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.820]   to 7, where it says
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.820]   "In those
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.820]   days, when the number of disciples
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.820]   was increasing, the Hellenistic
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.820]   Jews among them complained about the
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.820]   Hebraic Jews because their widows
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.820]   were being overlooked in the daily distribution
[00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.820]   of food.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.820]   So the twelve gathered all the disciples
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.820]   together and said, 'It would not be
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.820]   right for us to neglect the ministry
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.820]   of the word of God in order to wait on
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.820]   tables. Brothers
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.820]   and sisters, choose seven men
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.820]   from among you who are known to be full
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.820]   of the spirit and wisdom.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.820]   We will turn this responsibility over
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.820]   to them and will give our attention
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.820]   to prayer and the ministry of the word.'
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.820]   This proposal
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.820]   pleased the whole group.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.820]   They chose Stephen, a man full of faith
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.820]   and of the Holy Spirit, also Philip,
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.820]   Prochirus, Nicanor, Timon,
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.820]   Parmenas, and Nicholas from Antioch
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.820]   to convert to Judaism.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820]   They presented these men to the apostles
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.820]   who prayed and laid their hands
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.820]   on. So the
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.820]   word of God spread. The number of
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.820]   disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.820]   and a large number of priests
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.820]   became obedient to the faith.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.820]   This is an exciting period
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.820]   in the history of Christianity. The number
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.820]   of disciples was increasing. God's
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.820]   kingdom was growing. But
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.820]   as with any growth or scaling up,
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.820]   there were some challenges.
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.820]   I'm sure there were many other societal
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.820]   problems at the time, but in this passage
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.820]   our attention is drawn specifically
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.820]   to the hunger of Hellenistic Jewish widows
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.820]   that stemmed from a systemic
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.820]   problem. For
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.820]   context, being a widow in those
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.820]   days meant much more than
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.820]   having to deal with loss and
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.820]   grief. Even those things on their own
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.820]   are just terrible. It meant
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.820]   your entire social support
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.820]   system had collapsed.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.820]   Since husbands were expected to be
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.820]   duty-bound to be the providers,
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.820]   when they passed away, the responsibility
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.820]   was often delegated either to the husband's
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.820]   brothers or to
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.820]   the eldest son in the family.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.820]   Now, imagine
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.820]   if there were no brothers,
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.820]   or perhaps if there was a son,
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.820]   the son was not old enough yet
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.820]   to earn a living. Or maybe
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.820]   the family just refused outright to carry
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.820]   that responsibility.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.820]   As a result, many widows
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.820]   were extraordinarily vulnerable and
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.820]   reliant on charity and handouts.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.820]   Now clearly, this
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.820]   was already a recognized problem that
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.820]   was being addressed with the food rations.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.820]   However, whether intentionally
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.820]   or not, we don't see that necessarily
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.820]   from this particular passage.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.820]   The verses make it
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.820]   clear that the Hebrew-speaking
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.820]   widows within the community were being given
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.820]   preferential treatment over their
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.820]   Greek-speaking counterparts.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.820]   So you can really see how
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.820]   in a broken world,
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.820]   even acts with good intentions
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.820]   can aggravate injustices.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.820]   Our sin blinds
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.820]   us not to recognize
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.820]   when we act out of a place of
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.820]   prejudice or out of a place
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.820]   of favoritism.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.820]   And so it becomes systemic.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.820]   We mean well, but it causes
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.820]   more problems. And so being a
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.820]   restorative presence
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.820]   is crucial to consciously counteract
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.820]   this tendency.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.820]   There are three points that I want
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.820]   to focus our attention on here that allow the
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.820]   twelve to bring restoration
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.820]   to the widows. Firstly,
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.820]   they recognize that the pursuit of their goals
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.820]   was creating a negative,
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.820]   unintended outcome.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.820]   And they refused,
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.820]   secondly, they refused to ignore the problem
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.820]   because they knew doing so would
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.820]   undermine the purpose of the work that they were engaged in.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.820]   And lastly,
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.820]   they found simple, relatable,
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.820]   and pragmatic means of solving
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.820]   the issue.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.820]   There are two important lessons that we can
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.820]   learn from this.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.820]   The first is this.
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.820]   Pursuing an end,
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.820]   even a holy one,
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.820]   is empty if the means are not
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.820]   righteous also.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.820]   Can you imagine if the early church
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.820]   would have just kept on going how they were doing things,
[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.820]   how they were distributing the food, and what
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.820]   negative impact this would have had over time?
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.820]   As
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.820]   Christians, the end should never
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.820]   justify the means.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.820]   For we may
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.820]   quickly risk losing our way.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.820]   There are many cautionary tales
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.820]   in the church's over two thousand
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.820]   years of history, including horrible,
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.820]   unspeakable transgressions like the Crusades,
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.820]   or more recently, the subjugation
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.820]   of indigenous people. We do not
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   need to be as dramatic as citing these
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.820]   particular transgressions either.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.820]   Maybe you too
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.820]   can think of a situation where
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.820]   you had the best intentions,
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.820]   but ultimately the outcome backfired and was
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.820]   less than holy.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.820]   But the more relevant lesson, I think,
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.820]   for us in conjunction with the Stewarding Our Lives
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.820]   sermon series, is the question
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.820]   about how we connect our faith and our day-to-day
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.820]   work, and
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.820]   today's topic of
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.820]   restorative presence, is this.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.820]   Furthering the pursuit
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.820]   of God's kingdom is not
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.820]   just about worshipping
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.820]   and hearing God's word on a Sunday,
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.820]   as good and as wonderful as those things
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.820]   are. Pursuing God's
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.820]   kingdom is possible
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.820]   with very real, earthly,
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.820]   pragmatic means
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.820]   by our presence and how we do our work.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.820]   This includes, for
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.820]   example, identifying and acknowledging
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.820]   and responding to a problem,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.820]   practicing the division of
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.820]   labor and delegation, relying
[00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.820]   on the power of the body of
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.820]   Christ. We all have our strengths
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.820]   and weaknesses, but only Jesus can do everything
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.820]   by himself.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.820]   Recruiting people with the right qualifications
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.820]   for a given task, and of course
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.820]   offering everything that we do up to God
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.820]   in prayer.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.820]   The choosing of the seventh story
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.820]   from the Bible is highly
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.820]   relevant to our world today, the work
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.820]   we do, and how it connects
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.820]   to faith.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.820]   The story has elements of management,
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.820]   human resources, resource
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.820]   allocation, due process, and prayer.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.820]   If you think about it,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.820]   the problem, though serious,
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.820]   required a simple
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.820]   administrative response
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.820]   in the pursuit of wider strategic
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.820]   objectives.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.820]   The clients, in this case the widows,
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.820]   complained. Management, in this case
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.820]   the twelve, put their heads together
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.820]   and promptly came up
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.820]   with an issue, or resolved the issue, with an
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.820]   appropriate reallocation of internal human resources,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.820]   in this case the chosen seven.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.820]   Does this not
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.820]   sound something like your places
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.820]   of work? The kind of situations
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.820]   that you face on a daily basis?
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.820]   And yet it was a profound
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.820]   and beautiful act of faith
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.820]   in the pursuit of God's kingdom.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.820]   The point is this.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.820]   We all have the power to be
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.820]   a restorative presence because
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.820]   of our identity in Christ.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.820]   The chosen seven were
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.820]   physically present,
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.820]   and through their presence were able
[00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.820]   to take the actions that brought
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.820]   restoration to the widows,
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.820]   to the Hellenistic Jewish widows.
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.820]   Sure,
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.820]   what we do is important.
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.820]   It is certainly not Christ-like to
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.820]   pursue careers that, by design, exploit
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.820]   people or damage our environment
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.820]   without any mitigating measures.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.820]   But how we do
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.820]   what we do is just as important.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.820]   Even what seems like a mundane
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.820]   administrative act
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.820]   can become a powerful expression
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.820]   of faith in the pursuit of God's kingdom
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   if we choose to do it out of
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.820]   love and as a form of worship.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.820]   Now, let's take a pause
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.820]   for a moment because I'm sure that
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.820]   all of this can feel a bit overwhelming for some of us.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.820]   You might be sitting
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.820]   at home right now and thinking to yourself,
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.820]   "Sure, how I
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:11.820]   do my work or how I conduct myself
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.820]   on a day-to-day basis can be used
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.820]   as an act of worship,
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.820]   but who actually cares?"
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.820]   Or maybe you're thinking, "But I'm just one
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820]   person. What difference
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.820]   does it make?"
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.820]   Believe me, in my line of work,
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.820]   I struggle with these questions
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.820]   all the time.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.820]   Especially around impact,
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.820]   around purpose.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.820]   What is the point?
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   We are confronted with a broken world,
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820]   immeasurable needs, and finite
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.820]   resources. I can help
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.820]   these two people, but
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.820]   what about the other hundred that are
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.820]   going without any resources?
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.820]   Let me tell you this.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.820]   The odds
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.820]   don't matter.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   The statistics
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.820]   don't matter.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   And to some extent, even the outcome does not
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.820]   matter.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.820]   The most important question is this.
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.820]   What is your posture?
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.820]   Do you believe in the power of God
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.820]   and his plan for humanity?
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.820]   Do you believe this world
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   will be broken forever?
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.820]   Because if you believe
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.820]   Jesus will come again one day,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.820]   then there is only one logical conclusion.
[00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.820]   Each and every one of us
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.820]   must continue to serve with whatever
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.820]   abilities and resources we have.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.820]   The battle we are in may
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   be hard, and granted,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.820]   we may not be able to see its conclusion,
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.820]   but never forget, the war
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   has already been won.
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820]   Only by serving may we
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820]   share in the victory.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.820]   Let me share
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.820]   a very personal thing
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.820]   with you for a moment, and maybe this will
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.820]   be helpful to some of you.
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.820]   I have often felt
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.820]   overwhelmed by the brokenness of
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.820]   the world, and struggled with periods
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.820]   of anxiety because of it.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.820]   One really important principle I have learned
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.820]   in managing this is
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.820]   understanding that my sphere of interest
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.820]   is not the same
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.820]   as my sphere of influence.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.820]   I am concerned
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820]   about the world at large,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.820]   but I certainly cannot influence it.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.820]   I cannot change it.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   So, should I give up?
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.820]   Or, should I shift my focus
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.820]   to the things that I can influence?
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.820]   It's easy to be
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.820]   overwhelmed by the world, but remember this,
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.820]   the bigger picture is
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.820]   God's domain.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.820]   By partnering with Him, you get
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.820]   to let go of all of that,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.820]   and focus specifically on what you
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   can do, and how you do it.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.820]   Think of John
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.820]   chapter 1, verse 5, where it
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.820]   says, "The light shines
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.820]   in the darkness, and the darkness
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.820]   has not overcome it."
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.820]   Even if you are the only
[00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.820]   light in a sea of darkness, it already
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.820]   makes all the difference, because darkness
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.820]   is defined by the absence of light.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.820]   So,
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.820]   if we accept the limits of our spheres of influence,
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.820]   how do we become
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.820]   a restorative presence in our work?
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   It includes three primary practices.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.820]   Firstly,
[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.820]   being rooted in Christ.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.820]   Before we go about the work of restoration
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820]   in the world, we must be people
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.820]   of God, and allow
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   God to renew our hearts.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.820]   Secondly, being a
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.820]   cultivator of community.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.820]   Now, this serves two functions. Firstly,
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.820]   to be a restorative leader, we need to
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.820]   be in a community of support
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.820]   and encouragement, but we
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.820]   also need to be creators
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.820]   of community, providing the
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.820]   resourcing, the support, and the flourishing
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.820]   to all.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.820]   And lastly, being an advocate
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.820]   of justice in systems and structures.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.820]   We're called to be leaders
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.820]   who don't just address
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.820]   injustice that results from an individual
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.820]   action, but from collective,
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   institutional, and systemic practices.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.820]   In other words,
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.820]   no matter what our main
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.820]   professional purpose
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.820]   in life may be, and I include in this
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.820]   frankly, being a
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.820]   stay-at-home parent, for example, or
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.820]   being a stay-at-home spouse, or
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:05.820]   a student at school, or university,
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.820]   so not just traditional
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.820]   things that we would consider to be
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.820]   work, but what you spend the majority
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.820]   of your time with.
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.820]   In all of these circumstances, you can
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.820]   be a restorative presence
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.820]   by being rooted in Christ,
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.820]   choosing to cultivate community,
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.820]   and being an advocate for justice.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.820]   Put in even more plain terms,
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.820]   furthering God's kingdom
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.820]   is not just about what you do
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.820]   on a day-to-day basis,
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.820]   how you do it is equally
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.820]   as important.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.820]   I want to dig a little
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.820]   deeper into this relationship between
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.820]   the what and the how,
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.820]   and more importantly, the importance of
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.820]   the how.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.820]   In the story of the choosing of the seven,
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.820]   worrying about the
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.820]   food rations of the widows
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.820]   was definitely not the primary
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.820]   objective of the twelve.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.820]   It was not their "what", if you will.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.820]   Their focus was
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.820]   instead spreading the gospel.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.820]   That was their main objective, that was
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.820]   the "what" of what they were trying to achieve.
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.820]   So, let's apply
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.820]   then the three practices of being a
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.820]   restorative presence. Number one,
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.820]   I think we can safely assume
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.820]   that the twelve are rooted in Christ. I think we can
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.820]   just put that aside. So, number two,
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.820]   cultivating
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.820]   community. They made a conscious
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.820]   choice to cultivate their community
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.820]   by including the needs
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.820]   of the Hellenistic Jews.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.820]   And number three,
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.820]   they then advocated for systemic
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.820]   change, for systemic justice
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.820]   by improving the food distribution system.
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.820]   This was part of how
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.820]   they approached the "what" of
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.820]   their purpose, the ministry of the Word of God.
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.820]   They knew that
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.820]   going after that goal was not going to be
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.820]   possible if they did not change
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.820]   how they were doing it on the side.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.820]   It's easy to recognize
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.820]   the importance of what they were doing and therefore
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.820]   easy to understand the significance
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.820]   of how they were going about it.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.820]   But, let's take a look at scenarios
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.820]   where the "what" may not be as
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.820]   comparatively important
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.820]   as spreading the gospel.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.820]   Maybe you're asking yourselves this question
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.820]   right now.
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.820]   Is what I'm doing even relevant
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.820]   to the Kingdom of God?
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.820]   To furthering the Kingdom?
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.820]   If that is you, may I
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.820]   gently challenge you to turn
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.820]   your focus away from what
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.820]   you're doing and
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.820]   instead embrace how
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.820]   you're doing it as a way
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.820]   to glorify God.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.820]   Being in the light of God is not only determined
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.820]   by what you do, but how you
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.820]   do it.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.820]   Let me give you another personal
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.820]   example. In my role as
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.820]   Executive Director at Branches of Hope and in my
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.820]   career in humanitarian aid, you might think that I'm
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.820]   filled with purpose
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.820]   and pursuing objectives that are close to God's
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.820]   heart. That I recognize
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.820]   ultimately the restorative presence
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.820]   of my person and the organizations
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.820]   that I've worked for.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.820]   The truth though is that
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.820]   for a big part of my career, I was unable
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.820]   to see it that way.
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.820]   I fixated on the fact that
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.820]   I was not a doctor, I was not a nutritionist,
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.820]   I was not an agricultural
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.820]   expert or a community mobilizer or a case
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.820]   worker. I agonized
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.820]   that I did not have any technical
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:17.820]   expertise to contribute,
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.820]   nor did I feel that I was doing anything really
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.820]   that had an immediate tangible connection
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.820]   to the communities I was there to serve.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.820]   I managed
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.820]   and coordinated programs,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.820]   which meant, in essence,
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.820]   paperwork, reports,
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.820]   plans, meetings,
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.820]   emails, and generally
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.820]   just administrative work.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.820]   I was, and
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.820]   still am, a generalist.
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.820]   Or as some cynics might say,
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.820]   a jack of many trades,
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.820]   but a master of none.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.820]   It wasn't until much later, with the
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.820]   help of incredible mentors and coaches
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.820]   in my life, that I began to see the importance
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.820]   of being a generalist and that being
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.820]   a generalist was a God's gift.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.820]   Being a generalist
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.820]   means being able to build
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.820]   bridges and connect
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.820]   people and perspectives.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.820]   As I began to embrace my
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   gift, I started
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.820]   to pay more attention to how
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.820]   I was doing my work.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.820]   A meeting, for example,
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.820]   was an opportunity to cultivate community.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.820]   Reviewing a
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.820]   proposal or a report was an opportunity
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.820]   to ask the hard questions about
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.820]   systemic injustice.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.820]   More recently, in thinking
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.820]   about how I do my work, I tried to
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.820]   model servant leadership and
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.820]   focus on the quality of my interactions with people
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.820]   around me. You might call it
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.820]   taking a people-centric approach.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.820]   But the point is that
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.820]   as a follower of Christ, I challenge myself
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.820]   to recognize the needs,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.820]   the ambitions, the interests, and constraints
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.820]   of my colleagues, to recognize them
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.820]   as people first, and
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.820]   to work with them, not against them.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.820]   In so
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.820]   doing, I would like to think that I am a restorative
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.820]   presence in my workplace, though, of course,
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.820]   you can take some time to ask my colleagues themselves.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.820]   That said, I must also confess that I
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.820]   sometimes fall short of these ideals
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.820]   and let my emotions get the
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.820]   better of me.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.820]   But by the power of the Holy Spirit, I recognize
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.820]   my faults and I summon the courage
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.820]   to correct and apologize for them.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.820]   The moral of my
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.820]   story is this.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.820]   Ironically, I was only
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.820]   able, really, to take satisfaction in
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.820]   what I was doing
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.820]   after realizing the importance of
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.820]   how I was doing it.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.820]   Maybe you are feeling unfulfilled
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.820]   because you are just
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.820]   a paper pusher, or
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.820]   just a stay-at-home parent,
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.820]   or just a student.
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.820]   You don't see what impact you're having.
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.820]   But think for
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.820]   a moment about the people God has
[00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.820]   placed around you, your family,
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   your friends, your colleagues,
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.820]   even strangers on the street.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.820]   How you
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.820]   relate to them can be more powerful
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.820]   than what you do.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.820]   Ask yourself what injustice
[00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.820]   they might be facing, and what
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.820]   role you can play in addressing it.
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.820]   You can cultivate community
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.820]   with them, you can cry out
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.820]   for the injustices they experience,
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.820]   and you can be a restorative presence
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.820]   in their lives.
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.820]   Now, as I wrap up,
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.820]   beyond what
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.820]   the book of Acts, chapter 6,
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.820]   verses 1-7 teaches us,
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.820]   one thing I like about
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.820]   this particular passage is how
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.820]   it mirrors the story of Branches
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.820]   of Hope. Branches of Hope
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.820]   may not have been founded by the Twelve
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.820]   or run by the Chosen Seven,
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.820]   although I will say that our founders,
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.820]   John Snellgrove and Tony Reed, are old enough
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.820]   that they were probably around back then.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   But we were birthed out
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.820]   of a ministry of divine church
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.820]   in response to systemic injustice
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.820]   in our society.
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.820]   And that continues to be how,
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.820]   as an organization, we continue
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.820]   to be a restorative presence in the
[00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.820]   communities we serve.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.820]   We talked about what it takes to be a
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.820]   restorative presence today.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.820]   The three primary practices of being
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.820]   rooted in Christ, being a cultivator
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.820]   of community, and an advocate
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.820]   of injustice, or an advocate of justice.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   We also talked
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.820]   about
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.820]   what you do not being the only important
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.820]   thing, but that how
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.820]   you do it carries a proportionate
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.820]   amount of importance.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.820]   I hope that this has
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.820]   encouraged you to become a restorative
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.820]   presence in all of your everyday
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.820]   situations.
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.820]   Of course, if you'd like to amplify
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.820]   your restorative presence, one way
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.820]   you can do that is by partnering with organizations
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.820]   who are rooted in Christ, which
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.820]   cultivate community, and which
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.820]   do the work of advocacy
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.820]   by highlighting the injustice in systems
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.820]   and structures. In other
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.820]   words, partnering with organizations like
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.820]   Branches of Hope that have a restorative
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.820]   presence in Hong Kong.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.820]   That sounds like something that you would like to
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.820]   explore. I invite you to talk
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.820]   to us the next time that we are in New Long.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.820]   More than anything, we need people to sign up
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.820]   as regular monthly donors.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.820]   Any regular amount will help us provide financial
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.820]   stability to hundreds of people.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.820]   If just five people
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.820]   among you were to sign up today
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.820]   to give $100 a month, that would
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.820]   mean that we could support another person through
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.820]   our STAR Fund, our
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.820]   monthly financial assistance program.
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.820]   Of course, you may also choose to
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.820]   support some of our other programs, for example,
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.820]   our education services or our
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.820]   general service fund.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.820]   You can make a one-off donation or you can sign up
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.820]   as a volunteer. And you can
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.820]   also walk with us in prayer. We have some
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.820]   prayer guides available as well.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.820]   Now,
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.820]   lastly, I would like to close
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.820]   us in prayer. So,
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.820]   if you'll bow your heads with me.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.820]   Lord,
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.820]   I pray that my message
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.820]   today has achieved its
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.820]   intended purpose of
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.820]   helping us discover fresh
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.820]   ways to participate
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.820]   in your creative, redemptive
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.820]   and healing work
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.820]   of making all things new.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.820]   May the message today
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.820]   have glorified you
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.820]   by contributing to the
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.820]   broader aim of this sermon series
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.820]   of helping us find deeper meaning,
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.820]   hope, vision
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.820]   and courage for the work
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.820]   that we do in our daily lives.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.820]   I pray that we recognize
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.820]   the inherent value of how we go
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.820]   about our daily work,
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.820]   be it in the workplace, be it at home
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.820]   or in the school.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.820]   Lord,
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.820]   please show us in all situations
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.820]   how we can further your kingdom and be
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.820]   a restorative presence.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.820]   Please guard our steps
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.820]   and keep us on your path so that
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.820]   in the pursuit of your kingdom
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.820]   we may never stray
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.820]   and get lost in the brokenness of this world.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.820]   Lastly, Lord,
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.820]   I pray that the Holy Spirit should
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.820]   show all of us, just like
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.820]   he showed the apostles and how he has been
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.820]   showing branches of hope, how we
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.820]   can be facilitators of community
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.820]   and advocates of justice.
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.820]   Help us recognize
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.820]   not just the struggles
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.820]   of those around us
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.820]   but also how you desire for us
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.820]   to partner with you to address them.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.820]   Help us be the light
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.820]   in the darkness.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.820]   Amen.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.820]   Thank you, Yun Long. We're looking forward to seeing you real soon.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.820]   Thank you for
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.820]   such an inspiring message, Alex.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.820]   We hope that
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.820]   you are also encouraged by the message.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.820]   We hope you're encouraged and we pray
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.820]   that the Holy Spirit will come and guide you
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.820]   to bring his restorative
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.820]   presence back to wherever you are.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.820]   We pray that the Holy Spirit
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.820]   will help us bring his
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.820]   will, his justice, and so on
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.820]   back to our environment.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.820]   So that's it for this week.
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.820]   We hope we'll see you again next week.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.820]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.820]   See you next time.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.820]   Bye-bye.
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.660]   Bye.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.300]   you
