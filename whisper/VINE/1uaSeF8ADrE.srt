1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 Good morning, how's everyone doing?

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,560
 Good to see you guys again.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,520
 My name's Justin from Wan Chai Church,

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,720
 and I'll share a bit more later.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,080
 But recently, our family, I'm an only child,

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,560
 and we had a health scare in our family,

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,560
 so I flew back to Canada where my parents are,

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
 and I was chatting with my dad about what it feels like

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
 to be at the last season of your life.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,140
 My dad's healthy now, but he's 85,

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,080
 and so through our conversation,

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,540
 we just, I kind of just listened to him,

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,280
 and throughout the conversation,

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,160
 I hear him share about his regrets,

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,240
 you know, what he wish he'd done, what he hadn't done,

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,840
 and it's really fascinating, and it makes me think,

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,240
 well, you know, all of us have regrets,

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
 all of us experience regrets.

19
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,740
 I wonder, once we get to that stage in life,

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,820
 what kind of regrets I might have,

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,080
 what regrets you might have.

22
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,800
 And thinking about that, I looked up

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,960
 what regrets do people have at the end of their life,

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,960
 and actually, a really well-known hospice nurse,

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,360
 someone who takes care of the terminally ill,

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,120
 who is with people in the last stages of life,

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,440
 she was interviewed and asked,

28
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,840
 hey, what are the top regrets that people have,

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,000
 and I wanna just share it with you.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,160
 Is this too dark, or is it okay?

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,660
 All right, I'm just gonna go on.

32
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,660
 So these are what people say as their top five regrets.

33
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,440
 They wish that they'd been more loving

34
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,460
 to the people who matter most.

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,680
 They wish that they'd been a better spouse,

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,520
 parent, or child.

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,080
 They wish that they had not spent so much time working,

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,080
 and that they would enjoy life more and taken more risks.

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,360
 They wish they had taken better care of themselves,

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,120
 and also, they wish that they had chosen

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,980
 more meaningful work.

42
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,440
 Now, I don't know if these regrets surprise you or not,

43
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,820
 but what actually surprised me was,

44
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,680
 I'm surprised that there are no mention of forgiveness.

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,960
 You know, the fact that, oh, I wish I'd forgiven more,

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,000
 I wish I spent more time in my life

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 reconciling with the people I hurt,

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,840
 and so in my preparation for today,

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,640
 we are in the series of Joseph.

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,680
 We're still thinking about the story of Joseph.

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,920
 These regrets reminded me that the overarching

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,440
 story of Joseph has everything to do with finishing well,

53
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,240
 and finishing well means to be able to forgive,

54
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,660
 because as humans, we actually need forgiveness.

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,920
 We need to know that we can be reconciled,

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,280
 that we can be forgiven for everything we've done.

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,840
 It's both an urgent need, it's a necessity,

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,040
 and it's so important, and so Joseph's life

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
 reminds us that the journey of forgiveness

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,880
 and reconciliation, which is what we're gonna

61
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,520
 talk about today, has to be one of our greatest

62
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,600
 spiritual concerns and responsibilities before we die.

63
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,300
 This is important because if we read the Bible,

64
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,940
 we know that Jesus says, he commands us

65
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,320
 to forgive one another, no matter how many times

66
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,000
 we hurt each other, to learn to forgive,

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,880
 because the Lord has forgiven us,

68
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,640
 therefore, we're gonna try to do that.

69
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,160
 And so our great Christian concern,

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,320
 and our journey and responsibility is the following,

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,560
 is to make every effort, three things.

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,160
 One, forgive those who hurt us,

73
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,560
 forgive ourselves and the mistakes that we have made,

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
 and to take time to wrestle with God,

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,280
 and just bring to him and say to him,

76
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,640
 you know what, life is unfair.

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,680
 I don't understand life because it's unjust,

78
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,840
 but yet, to wrestle and come to a point

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,200
 where we know that God is in the midst

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,240
 of our unforgiveness, God sits with us in our pain.

81
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,120
 And so when we forgive, why do we need to forgive?

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
 Well, just a short answer is, you know,

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,840
 this world is broken, we know that, we are broken,

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,400
 but when a living God does work in broken people like us,

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,420
 and people see that we're not gonna retaliate,

86
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,120
 we're not gonna avenge ourselves,

87
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,840
 there is hope for this world.

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
 And so this morning, I wanna focus

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
 on the grand narrative of Joseph's life.

90
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,680
 I want us to appreciate, in the short time that we have,

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,520
 I want us to appreciate, you know, he suffered much,

92
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,280
 he went through a lot of loss,

93
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,300
 he was traumatized by everything he'd gone through,

94
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,600
 but yet, Joseph remained a Christian,

95
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,320
 he continued, allowed God to use him

96
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,080
 to change the world, literally,

97
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,760
 and of course, at the end of his life, he died well, why?

98
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
 Because he reconciled with the brothers

99
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,200
 that done so much harm to him,

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
 and he reconciled with his father,

101
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,880
 and he saw his baby brother, Benjamin, again.

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,320
 And so, this is so important,

103
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,320
 and I want to ask two things of us,

104
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,680
 two questions I wanna focus on.

105
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
 As we look at Joseph's story, I want us to look at,

106
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
 well, how do I, how do you be more intentional

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,200
 to forgive and to reconcile,

108
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,760
 knowing that we've been hurt deeply?

109
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,000
 And equally important, I want us to understand,

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
 at least, starting point today,

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,120
 how do I reconcile the unforgiveness in my heart right now?

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,880
 And I think all of us have some kind of hatred,

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,120
 some kind of guilt, some kind of just sadness

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,320
 in what we've experienced through our life

115
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,880
 when it comes to forgiveness and reconciliation.

116
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,960
 And so, I think the steps of forgiveness and reconciliation,

117
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,080
 getting there may look a little different,

118
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,960
 but the end goal is very similar.

119
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,480
 The end goal and the aim of being forgiving,

120
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,600
 to forgive and to be reconciled,

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,520
 is to experience some kind of shalom

122
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,480
 in our relationship with God,

123
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,900
 with ourselves, and with one another.

124
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,440
 So, quick story.

125
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,560
 The other day, I was driving home with my eldest son,

126
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,400
 who's right there, and he just started high school.

127
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,840
 And he actually, while we're driving,

128
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
 we normally listen to music together,

129
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,400
 and he asked me a question

130
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,360
 that actually threw me off by surprise,

131
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
 and it was a wonderful question.

132
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,640
 He asked, "Dad, what regrets do you have in high school?"

133
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,080
 I just thought, wow, where do I begin?

134
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,280
 I have so many regrets.

135
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,600
 But I said to him, "Hey, son, overall, I had a great life.

136
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
 "I had a great high school.

137
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,340
 "My parents were good to me.

138
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,320
 "I had good friends.

139
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,800
 "Yeah, I made some mistakes.

140
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,120
 "I did some really stupid things,

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
 "but overall, it would not change anything.

142
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,000
 "But to answer your question, son,

143
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,400
 "what I regret most was probably the few words

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,140
 "I said to two friends.

145
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,480
 "I just said a few words, and that ended our friendship."

146
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,760
 Now, back then, I was overly Christian,

147
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,080
 and so I might have said something really dumb,

148
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,360
 and our friendship never recovered from that.

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,000
 And so to this day, I still yearn to reconcile

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
 with these two friends.

151
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,360
 I message them once every five years

152
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,240
 just to say hi, but silence, which is fine.

153
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,280
 And I think to this day, it still hurts.

154
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,680
 And so three weeks ago, I experienced some kind of healing.

155
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,880
 Something Pastor Andrew said in Wan Chai casually to me.

156
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,020
 He said, "Hey, Justin, whether you're in ministry or not,

157
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,140
 "you're gonna get hurt.

158
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,520
 "You're gonna hurt people."

159
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,720
 I was like, whoa.

160
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,240
 And I think this is what I could not accept.

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,160
 All these years, the reason why it stinks so hardly

162
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,360
 is because I refuse to accept the reality

163
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
 that we will hurt people.

164
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,880
 But I'm a pastor, I'm a Christian.

165
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,520
 But actually, the reality is,

166
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,800
 whether you're a Christian or not,

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,780
 we're gonna hurt people

168
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,200
 as long as we remain in relationships.

169
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,040
 And so today, I want to just start off to remind us

170
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,360
 that none of us are immune to heartaches and uncertainties

171
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,120
 as long as we remain in relationships.

172
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,320
 However, I want to bring hope today.

173
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,640
 And I wanna say, but our decision, our resolve,

174
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,480
 our intention to forgive and to reconcile

175
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,080
 breathes new life into these relational uncertainties

176
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,440
 and the heartaches that we hold right now.

177
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,320
 And so maybe the solution is not to stop sinning.

178
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,160
 The solution isn't just to stay away

179
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
 from people who've hurt us.

180
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
 But as we mature as Christians,

181
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,800
 I think the point of Christian growth is to discern

182
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 how do we bring our hurt before our living God?

183
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,000
 How do we bring these broken relationships

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,560
 before our living God so that the next time we get hurt,

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,840
 we spend less time being surprised, angry, shocked,

186
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,800
 and we just deal with it?

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,320
 Are you with me?

188
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,740
 So church, this morning, I'm not gonna read,

189
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,040
 I know you guys have gone through a lot of scripture

190
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,840
 through the life of Joseph.

191
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,240
 I'm not gonna read blocks of scripture,

192
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,720
 but I just want you to take one thing

193
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,000
 that Holy Spirit shows you today.

194
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,920
 Okay, just one thing that you feel like God

195
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,600
 is asking you to lean into, to take.

196
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,880
 And I'm gonna come back to that afterwards.

197
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,800
 So this morning, I wanna focus on two aspects

198
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,280
 of Joseph's life that we may easily bypass.

199
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,440
 One, I wanna talk about time.

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,780
 And two, I wanna talk about grace.

201
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,920
 I know we talk about that a lot, but walk with me, okay?

202
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,640
 And I want you to think about,

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
 well, if I'm serious today about forgiveness,

204
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,920
 I want to take another step towards reconciliation.

205
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,000
 I want you to think about this.

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,400
 What does time and grace have to say to us today?

207
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,740
 So let me do a summary.

208
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,860
 Now, between the time that Joseph was 17

209
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,240
 to the time he was 30, 30 was the time

210
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,720
 when he got enlisted, right, to serve Pharaoh

211
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 and to change the world, save the world from famine.

212
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,640
 There was around a period of 13 years,

213
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,680
 and these 13 years happened between Genesis 37 and 41,

214
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,360
 and I know you know this 'cause you read your Bible, right?

215
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,400
 And so by that time, between 17 to 30,

216
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,360
 Joseph had already experienced a lot of personal pain,

217
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,480
 a lot of growth through loss, but also a lot of trauma.

218
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,860
 And so let's just start with Joseph's upbringing, right?

219
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,280
 Joseph grew up, he found himself to be the center

220
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,560
 of his brother's hatred, why?

221
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,360
 Because he was his father's favorite, right?

222
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,540
 And I don't know if you know that feeling

223
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,800
 when your boss likes your colleague more,

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 or if you grew up in your family and you have other siblings

225
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,280
 and you kind of felt that maybe your parents

226
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,800
 preferred your siblings more,

227
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,240
 and that really goes deep and it stings.

228
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,060
 And so his brothers were jealous of Joseph,

229
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,500
 in a way hated him, but what made it worse

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,640
 was Joseph's dream, right?

231
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,400
 Joseph had a dream that said,

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,120
 you're gonna bow down to me one day,

233
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,040
 and that just did not help the relationship.

234
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,860
 And so rather than deal with their pain,

235
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,160
 what did their brothers do?

236
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,980
 Let's just get rid of Joseph, right?

237
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,160
 Yeah, that's the best way to do it.

238
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,120
 And so that's what they did.

239
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,580
 They're like, let's throw him in a pit.

240
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,860
 No, no, no, no, actually, let's just sell him.

241
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,940
 Let's just sell him off for some silver.

242
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,620
 All right, agreed, so that's what happened.

243
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,100
 And so fast forward, because the Lord was with Joseph,

244
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,420
 Joseph found himself having favor from God

245
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,780
 and having favor of man,

246
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,780
 he found himself overseeing Potiphar's household.

247
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,560
 But however, once again, unfortunately,

248
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,960
 within a short period,

249
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,960
 Joseph was unexpectedly falsely thrown into prison, why?

250
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,900
 Because he refused to have an affair

251
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,040
 with his master's wife, right?

252
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,700
 Now, this is already a lot to deal with, right?

253
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,260
 And so I wanna just pick up from Genesis 41, verse one,

254
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,060
 and I want us to focus on three words, okay?

255
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,360
 These three words, I spent a lot of time just mulling over.

256
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,880
 These three words says, two years later.

257
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,220
 I just want us to focus on these three words right now.

258
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,500
 Two years later, so before God brought Joseph

259
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,100
 into the courts of Pharaoh to interpret his dream,

260
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,660
 before he was promoted to the second man of all of Egypt,

261
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,980
 Joseph quietly spent two years in jail.

262
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,740
 Now, scripture doesn't say much

263
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,720
 about how he spent the two years,

264
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,420
 but what do you think he thought about?

265
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,760
 You know, if you were Joseph, you spent this two years,

266
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,180
 wouldn't you spend a lot of your time

267
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,220
 thinking about justice?

268
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,340
 Wouldn't you spend a lot of time

269
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,460
 blaming either your brothers or God, maybe?

270
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,420
 And I just wondered, as I was preparing,

271
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,260
 do you think that Joseph knew

272
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,920
 that God was with him in these two years?

273
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,300
 And what is the most profound thing about this verse

274
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,700
 as it relates to the process of forgiveness

275
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,520
 and reconciliation is the aspect of time.

276
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,540
 Because time is something I think many of us struggle with

277
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,180
 because often it is misplaced and it is misused.

278
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,580
 Because the world tells us that, you know, guys,

279
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,320
 we should use our time to cultivate more influence,

280
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,140
 more wealth, more power.

281
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,400
 Spend time to build up your career path

282
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,500
 so that you have something in the future to fall back on.

283
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,680
 Now, this isn't wrong, it's not sinful,

284
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,080
 but when we overly emphasize our use of time like this,

285
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,160
 we lose sight of what is truly important.

286
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,880
 And the most precious, rewarding, and meaningful things

287
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,260
 in God's kingdom all require time.

288
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,300
 You know, to grow in Christ requires,

289
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,120
 to forgive someone, to reconcile requires,

290
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,600
 to know Jesus requires time.

291
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,220
 And so, if you and I, church,

292
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,620
 we are serious about this journey that we are called to take

293
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,460
 then we have to somehow learn to yield our time to God

294
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,400
 because we believe that he will make good use

295
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,080
 of every season of our life.

296
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,640
 And so, Joseph's story, his life throughout Genesis,

297
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,320
 we can see that forgiveness and reconciliation

298
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,840
 works within every season of life,

299
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,680
 even the seasons we don't like.

300
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,780
 So, coming back to us, because we're impatient people,

301
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:52,920
 I am impatient a lot of times, we demand others to change.

302
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,980
 I don't know if you feel me.

303
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,840
 It's like, Lord, I don't have that much time.

304
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,680
 I can't take so and so, can you just change them please?

305
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,580
 Can you ask them to forgive me

306
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,960
 or can you just get them to just say sorry

307
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,080
 and we can both move on?

308
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,540
 But likewise, I think sometimes out of desperation,

309
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,100
 out of pain, out of just we cannot take it longer,

310
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,920
 we ask God, Lord, would you heal my heart

311
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,440
 so that I don't actually have to deal with it

312
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,080
 'cause I have other things to do.

313
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,540
 You know, and I think humanly speaking,

314
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,680
 it comes to a point where I think all of us

315
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,560
 need to reconcile and accept that no matter how painful,

316
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,020
 how slow, how uncontrollable our seasons of life are,

317
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,140
 that God will work within us to bring about

318
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,680
 the transformation he wills in time.

319
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,900
 And it cannot be rushed.

320
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,680
 For example, for Joseph's brothers,

321
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,940
 how many years did it take for them to come to repentance,

322
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,240
 to realize, oh, you know what, not only did we hurt Joseph,

323
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,760
 we lied to our dad, we told our dad

324
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,720
 that his favorite son was dead.

325
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,020
 You know, and how many years did that take?

326
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,720
 It took around 17 years in God's timing,

327
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,540
 which is not what we would prefer if we had a choice.

328
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,280
 And think about this for a moment for yourselves.

329
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,240
 You know, I'm stubborn, I don't know about you,

330
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,180
 I don't wanna call you stubborn.

331
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,720
 I'm a bit prideful, I don't know about you.

332
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,840
 And so I want you just to think,

333
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,560
 how long does it take for you to admit that you need help?

334
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,280
 How long does it take for you to admit that you're wrong,

335
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,000
 that we are wrong sometimes?

336
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
 How long does it take for you to come to a place

337
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,240
 of genuine repentance and say, Lord, I can't change myself,

338
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,960
 I can't change the person in front of me,

339
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,560
 so Lord, would you have a go?

340
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,560
 How long does it take before we can extend

341
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,260
 the same compassion and mercy that God extends us normally?

342
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,760
 The answer, I think, that I want to say is that I know,

343
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,580
 I feel like all of us are often in a hurry

344
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,900
 when it comes to the matters of the heart, but God is not.

345
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,460
 God's way of working is different.

346
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,700
 And so coming back to Joseph,

347
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,000
 how did he spend the two years?

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,800
 Well, scripture doesn't say that much,

349
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,560
 but it does say in chapter 41, verse 50 to 20,

350
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,320
 it says that Joseph said, God made me forget

351
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,840
 all my hardships and everything that happened

352
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,600
 in my father's house.

353
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
 So that gives me an indication,

354
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,920
 that gives us an indication that he wrestled.

355
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,440
 He must have wrestled between his right to remain angry,

356
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,040
 his right to take avenge, his right to fantasize,

357
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,080
 what I'm gonna do to my brothers when I see him,

358
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,240
 what am I gonna say for the ultimate confrontation?

359
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,840
 But yet we also know when you read about Joseph's life,

360
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,160
 he was a righteous man.

361
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,240
 He, his heart was right,

362
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
 even though everything around him was not.

363
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,280
 And so Joseph knew that God's way led to life.

364
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,160
 And so I imagine he gave up his right

365
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,600
 to all the things, to take claim, you know,

366
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,380
 and he probably struggled a lot.

367
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,140
 And I think this is the heart of repentance.

368
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,840
 I think in the two years that Joseph spent in jail,

369
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,380
 in prison, he had to repent, he had to shift his mindset.

370
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,400
 And he had to say, you know what,

371
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
 I don't understand any of this, but God does.

372
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,560
 So I'm gonna choose to think what he thinks

373
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,120
 and I'm just gonna go with him.

374
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,440
 And of course we're asking, well, how does he do that?

375
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,360
 You know, I know we're not in prison,

376
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,160
 but I think we are imprisoned by certain thoughts

377
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,340
 and lifestyle choices and certain relationships.

378
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,380
 And so this is the hope.

379
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,820
 It says in Genesis 39, it says this,

380
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,340
 "The Lord was with Joseph,

381
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,540
 "and the Lord showed him steadfast love,

382
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,380
 "so that whatever Joseph did, the Lord blessed him."

383
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,700
 Right, and I think this is the only way I can reconcile,

384
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,160
 we can reconcile how Joseph spent his time.

385
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,240
 Joseph spent these two years quietly

386
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,940
 because the Lord was with him.

387
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,340
 And so he processed his heartache, his loss, his grief,

388
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,700
 everything with the Lord, and this is the Christian life.

389
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,780
 I wanna read you Acts chapter three,

390
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,940
 it's not on the slides, but I wanna read it to you.

391
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,860
 It says, "Repent and turn to God

392
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,560
 "so that your sins may be wiped out,

393
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,740
 "so that times of refreshing may come

394
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,340
 "from the presence of the Lord,

395
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,820
 "so that you may no longer be enslaved."

396
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,180
 So Joseph repented, he shifted his mindset

397
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,980
 to know that, you know what, I'm not in prison

398
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,100
 because the Lord is with me.

399
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,740
 How can it be prison if the Lord is with me?

400
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,420
 I'm gonna turn, I'm gonna give up,

401
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,300
 I'm gonna yield my right to avenge myself, Lord,

402
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,980
 and I'm gonna give you my unforgiveness,

403
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,700
 I'm gonna give you my pain.

404
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,140
 And this first act says, "So that times of refreshing

405
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,660
 "may come from the presence of the Lord."

406
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,000
 And so Joseph, his life, his mindset,

407
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,920
 the weight of his heart was refreshed.

408
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,460
 And so Joseph understood that only over time

409
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,060
 and with the Lord can we attain true growth

410
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,620
 and have clarity in life.

411
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,020
 You know, coming back to what I've done to my friends,

412
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,600
 the few words I said when I was 17,

413
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,340
 now as a 42-year-old man,

414
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,960
 like, of course I wouldn't have said that.

415
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,740
 But it took so many years for me

416
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,740
 to finally have this clarity, to grow,

417
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,700
 thinking, you know what, even though we're Christians

418
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,780
 doesn't mean we should say certain things.

419
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,720
 It doesn't give us the right to say anything we want

420
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,540
 just 'cause the Lord calls us to, right?

421
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,580
 I won't go into that.

422
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,620
 And so, church, I just want to say one more time

423
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,900
 that even if it's two years spent in prison

424
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,860
 or that we are in prison, if the Lord is there,

425
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,160
 then there is your growth and you will have clarity

426
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
 and you will be refreshed and blessed

427
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,340
 and you will be able to cope.

428
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,180
 You with me?

429
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,020
 - Yes.

430
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,340
 - So I want to highlight now the second thing, okay?

431
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,180
 The second thing I want to talk about is grace.

432
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,180
 And this happens in Genesis 42 now.

433
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,260
 And this is where the tables have turned

434
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,020
 and Joseph's dream when he was 17,

435
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,300
 the dream that he had actually comes true

436
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,260
 because the famine has started

437
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,200
 and Joseph here finds his brothers now are before him.

438
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,460
 They don't know that he's governor

439
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,980
 but they've come to get food

440
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,320
 because they don't want to die, right?

441
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,860
 His father asked him to come and get food.

442
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,020
 And so let me just pause here

443
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,540
 because Joseph was wronged when he was 17

444
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,420
 and he was powerless.

445
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,260
 But now 20-something years later, 16, 20 years later,

446
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,980
 he is one of the most powerful men in the world.

447
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,140
 Now, if you were in Joseph's shoes,

448
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,140
 I think you and I would probably act or think similarly.

449
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,940
 And so Joseph had every chance to avenge himself

450
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,020
 because he had the power to show them.

451
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,980
 He had the power to punishment,

452
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,620
 to punish them and to retaliate.

453
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,900
 But why I love the story of Joseph

454
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,520
 and probably why we are studying the life of Joseph

455
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,240
 is because he chose an altogether different way of living.

456
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,680
 He chose forgiveness, he chose reconciliation,

457
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,660
 and in the end, he had no regrets in life

458
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,780
 because he reconciled with his family.

459
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,140
 And so through Joseph's willingness to forgive

460
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,980
 and through the grace and the divine working of God,

461
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,360
 his brothers repented, confronted their sin,

462
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,820
 their father and Benjamin, all of them were reunited.

463
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,260
 And so Joseph's story encouraged us

464
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,440
 not only is to imagine and to hope for forgiveness,

465
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,300
 but actually when we look at Joseph's life,

466
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,300
 forgiveness and reconciliation is possible.

467
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,180
 It is a reality.

468
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,780
 And I think there is truth here.

469
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,100
 And I think Apostle Paul, he articulates this

470
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100
 many, many, many years later,

471
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,300
 something that probably Joseph already knew to be true.

472
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,020
 And it's Romans chapter two, verse four.

473
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,440
 Do you not realize that God's kindness

474
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,920
 is meant to lead us to repentance?

475
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,500
 So church, today, if you are struggling to forgive,

476
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,100
 if you find yourself that it is hard to reconcile

477
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,980
 my unforgiveness, my hatred, I know I shouldn't think

478
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,740
 these things, I shouldn't think ill of my brother and sister

479
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,620
 but yet you are struggling, then I wanna say

480
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,820
 the first step for you today is to experience

481
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,580
 God's grace and love afresh.

482
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,980
 There is no other place, there is no knowledge,

483
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,220
 and church, I want you to hear me,

484
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,620
 there is no knowledge that can replace the necessity

485
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,780
 of you placing yourself in the path of God's love and grace.

486
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,020
 So if you're struggling with forgiveness,

487
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,120
 then you have to put yourself in the path of God's grace

488
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,840
 so that you experience his love

489
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,620
 and this is the Christian life.

490
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,820
 Whatever it takes for you to put yourself

491
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,580
 in direct line of God's grace, you do.

492
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,980
 If you have to sell something, you have to smash idols,

493
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,640
 you have to get out of a place that feels unsafe

494
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,940
 that is triggering you, I think we have to wisely

495
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,620
 think of ways how we can place ourselves

496
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,420
 so at least even if a bit of his grace hits us,

497
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,780
 that's where we need to be.

498
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,780
 And when I think about Christian grace,

499
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,140
 as a pastor I think a lot,

500
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,900
 especially what is the Christian faith,

501
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,980
 what does it mean to be a Christian?

502
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,100
 Well, my recent thought, and I think Chapman

503
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,100
 said it quite beautifully, our faith is passed on.

504
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:41,140
 The Christian faith is not just sound or dry doctrine

505
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,640
 and traditions that we try to follow,

506
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,980
 but no, the Christian faith is revealed faith,

507
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,980
 it's living faith, it's walking with a living God.

508
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,340
 And our Christian, we grow because God reveals himself

509
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,380
 to us and we are transformed

510
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,080
 and this is what it means to be a Christian.

511
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,020
 And so like Joseph, Joseph, he encountered God for himself

512
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,100
 so that he knew what God said was true

513
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,660
 and likewise, we need to experience his grace

514
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,260
 and if the Bible says, for example, Psalm 145 says,

515
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,660
 "The Lord is good to all, he has compassion

516
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,680
 "on all that he has made."

517
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,640
 Do you believe that?

518
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,500
 Would you stake your life, would you do,

519
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,920
 when 10 people are doing this thing,

520
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,380
 would you do this one thing because you know

521
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,160
 that God, he said he's good, he said he's faithful,

522
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,560
 he will walk with us and therefore I will follow

523
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,600
 what he says.

524
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,540
 And so practically now, I wanna speak to us,

525
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,520
 those who are hurting right now.

526
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,580
 You find it difficult to trust God,

527
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,620
 you find it difficult to trust again,

528
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,800
 which I understand, you are offended right now,

529
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,000
 you are struggling with hatred,

530
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,600
 I'm gonna speak to us right now.

531
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,360
 And I want to call you to think about now,

532
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,240
 how do we learn to follow God's kindness again?

533
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,000
 And I want to just share three simple ways, okay?

534
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,760
 It says in Genesis, right,

535
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,360
 the Lord showed Joseph steadfast love,

536
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,120
 the Lord was with Joseph.

537
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,280
 I think just the first question I wanna ask you,

538
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,200
 will you let God show you steadfast love today?

539
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,000
 'Cause I think a lot of times I feel so much lack

540
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,880
 and I go to the wrong things and I get more tired,

541
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,000
 I get more depleted and you know,

542
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,800
 as a Chinese, in Chinese culture, there's a lot of face.

543
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,440
 You know, my parents, they don't let me do anything.

544
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,320
 They don't let me pay, they don't let me,

545
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,800
 it's like, mom, dad, I'm 42, can I pay for this meal,

546
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,720
 please, and I have to beg them.

547
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,760
 And finally, they relent, okay, fine, fine,

548
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,320
 you pay the $10, I'll pay, I'll cover the tips.

549
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,960
 It's like, no, like, you're not understanding,

550
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,400
 please let me give, you know?

551
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,640
 And I think a lot of us as Christians,

552
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,760
 we feel so sufficient, we feel that we can do it

553
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,060
 until we can't.

554
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,440
 And so today, I just wanna ask you,

555
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,540
 the first step, will you let God lead you today

556
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,420
 towards forgiveness?

557
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,840
 Now, second thing, coming back to if the Christian faith is,

558
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,000
 it's lived out, then I want to say that, you know what?

559
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,920
 That growth comes through relationships.

560
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,000
 And if we want to experience God's grace,

561
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,820
 then we have to, we have to figure out

562
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,180
 how to be with the church,

563
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,500
 because the church is the hands and feet of God, right?

564
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,520
 Now, hear me out here, okay?

565
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,080
 I'm not, I don't, just because someone says

566
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,960
 they're a Christian, just 'cause they say,

567
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,940
 I come to church every week, I serve,

568
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,440
 it doesn't mean in our woundedness

569
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
 that we should just throw ourself at them and say,

570
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,940
 hey, can you just speak into my life?

571
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,060
 You know, and I want to just encourage you

572
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,440
 to think about safe people, brothers and sisters

573
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,560
 who you know love the Lord, they fear the Lord,

574
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,800
 they love his word, and you know what?

575
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
 Jesus says to look at their fruit,

576
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,720
 look at their actions in their life.

577
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,200
 And if I want to experience God's grace,

578
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,960
 I want to look for people who are forgiving.

579
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,240
 I want to look for people who are trying

580
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,320
 their hardest to reconcile.

581
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,920
 Whether they do it or not in our lifetime, we don't know.

582
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,400
 But I want to surround myself with people

583
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,000
 who will pray for me, who, because they understand

584
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,920
 that forgiveness is important.

585
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,800
 And I want to slowly be able to confess and read the word

586
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,380
 and grow together with these people.

587
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,440
 So I want to, I want to encounter God's grace through you.

588
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,160
 And I want to figure out how do we forgive together,

589
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,560
 how do we reconcile, 'cause I can't do it my own.

590
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,340
 And lastly, I want to say that if we want to be led

591
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,920
 by God's kindness and his grace, that it means noticing,

592
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,640
 learning to notice what God is doing in your life right now.

593
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,240
 You know, because we are so busy

594
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,880
 that we miss what God is doing every single moment.

595
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,920
 And so how I discern this is, well, every day I journal,

596
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,700
 and every day, throughout every moment,

597
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,960
 I'm just asking myself, is God revealing himself to me?

598
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,800
 So if he is revealing himself,

599
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,240
 how am I transformed because of it?

600
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,040
 Right, because I can listen to sermons, a lot of sermons,

601
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,640
 I can go to a lot of conferences,

602
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,100
 I can do all these things, but if I'm unchanged,

603
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,240
 I'm not transformed, then what's the point?

604
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,140
 And so I want you to think about next time

605
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,480
 you feel like, oh my gosh, this is God's grace for me.

606
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,320
 I want you just to remember and note it down

607
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,220
 and say, this is God's grace.

608
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,600
 And write down how does that act of love transform you.

609
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,840
 When someone prays for you, when someone buys you a meal,

610
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,280
 when someone just comes to you and says, how are you doing?

611
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,820
 You know, when you guys come to me and say,

612
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,260
 can I pray for you, Justin?

613
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,760
 That is God's love, that is his grace for me,

614
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,560
 and I receive that each time.

615
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,140
 And so when we think about Joseph's life,

616
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,360
 ultimately, I think, by experiencing his grace,

617
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,980
 we can trust again, we would have courage

618
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,920
 to let him teach us what it means, like Joseph,

619
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,280
 to sit with God and to process our unforgiveness,

620
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,200
 to process our hurt, and so we can rely on the same God

621
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
 that led Joseph.

622
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,520
 And Joseph's life, I think, shows us and challenges us

623
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,200
 with an issue of trust.

624
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,880
 And so this morning, I think Joseph's life asks us,

625
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,920
 will you trust God's grace to lead you?

626
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,560
 Church, I'm just gonna bring it to a close,

627
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,480
 and you know, there was so much I want to share

628
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,080
 with us today, and I actually just stopped it there.

629
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,920
 But I want just to remind us of the most important thing,

630
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,680
 and I just wanna remind us that we follow a living God,

631
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,120
 and every moment, I don't know what season you're in

632
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,720
 right now, how difficult, maybe it's not, maybe it's okay,

633
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,240
 but every single moment, every season,

634
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,040
 the living God is with us, and we can experience

635
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,240
 his amazing grace if your heart is open,

636
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,040
 if your eyes are open.

637
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,520
 And each time we lean in, each time we obey,

638
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,640
 each time we feel a shift in our hearts,

639
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,760
 that is spiritual growth.

640
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,840
 It's sometimes not detected, it's not detectable,

641
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,000
 it's not measurable, we can't always express

642
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,560
 what God is doing in us, but the fact that you guys

643
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,800
 are sitting here, we are worshiping together,

644
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,760
 means that God is doing something in your life

645
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,520
 every single day, every single moment,

646
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,020
 or else you would not be here.

647
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:47,000
 And so I want to call you to keep on working out

648
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,600
 your salvation with fear and trembling,

649
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,920
 knowing that the living God wants to lead us.

650
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,080
 He yearns that we would be reconciled to him,

651
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,760
 be reconciled with those we struggle with,

652
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,200
 or those that we just want to be closer with.

653
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,000
 And so I had a picture for us when I was preparing

654
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,760
 for this message for Yunlong, and I think the life

655
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,880
 and the journey of forgiving and reconciliation is,

656
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,920
 you know when you're at the beach and the waves come?

657
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,640
 It's called the ebb and flow.

658
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,080
 The waves come in, they crash, they go out.

659
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,320
 On some days, we want to forgive.

660
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,600
 On some days, we so bad yearn to be reconciled

661
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,720
 with those who we love, but the same time,

662
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,000
 on most days, we get washed off on the shore,

663
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,340
 we get stuck in hatred, we get stuck in unforgiveness,

664
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,000
 we get stuck in our misery of not knowing what to do,

665
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,700
 but in this picture, I just want to encourage you

666
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,820
 that God sees you, Jesus sees you,

667
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,740
 Jesus hears your prayers as we are ebbing

668
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,400
 and flowing back and forth, and today's word,

669
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,000
 I just want to remind us that his kindness is,

670
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,220
 will lead you through every season.

671
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:10,240
 You know, and for me, I came to Christ when I was 16,

672
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,120
 and I'm 42 this year, and I'm still learning how to forgive.

673
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,080
 And I truly believe, like Joseph's life,

674
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,040
 it's God's grace is for us every day,

675
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,360
 but transformation is gonna take time.

676
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,560
 And so I want to call you to be patient

677
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,720
 and to be okay that God is working.

678
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,560
 And time, they say, you know, time heals all wounds.

679
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,720
 I want to challenge that because I don't think it's true.

680
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,880
 You know, time doesn't change, heal all wounds,

681
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,600
 nor does forgiveness, just 'cause you forgive,

682
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,000
 it doesn't mean it guarantees reconciliation.

683
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,640
 It doesn't guarantee that the other person

684
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,100
 will think the same of you.

685
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,980
 But I do know that God alone heals us, yeah?

686
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,860
 And also, no matter how difficult it is,

687
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,100
 you know, it's like, Justin, why should I forgive, you know?

688
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,300
 Why should I forgive?

689
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,420
 Well, I think we forgive because whenever we forgive,

690
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,960
 whenever we step in faith and say,

691
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,180
 Lord, lead us in your grace so that I can forgive,

692
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,980
 we are the ones that are actually changed.

693
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,540
 Even if no one else changes, you are the one

694
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,300
 that is forever changed because of God's grace

695
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,460
 and of what he's doing.

696
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,540
 And so I want to end with, I just want you to think back

697
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,460
 to what the hospice nurse said, you know,

698
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,160
 the regrets that people have at the end of their life.

699
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,280
 And I want to just stand before you,

700
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,140
 and I hope you can keep me accountable to this.

701
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,660
 You know, I decided in preparation for this message

702
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,880
 that I don't want to ever regret wasting God's time.

703
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,660
 I don't want to ever, at the end of my life,

704
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,420
 you know, look back and say, oh my gosh,

705
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,060
 I wasted God's grace.

706
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,980
 God's grace was there every single day

707
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,460
 and I just didn't take it.

708
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,940
 I just ran away, I just tried to delude myself,

709
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,740
 I just tried to like, you know, not deal with the pain.

710
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,140
 And so I just want to call you back, you know, church,

711
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,340
 if God's kindness is leading you,

712
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,180
 if God's grace is here with us and for us

713
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,440
 and available to us in every season of life,

714
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,440
 then will you join me and take true responsibility

715
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,280
 and make forgiveness your concern?

716
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,060
 I'm gonna pray for us now.

717
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:33,080
 Jesus, I pray, Lord, that we understand,

718
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,980
 and actually we do understand how short life is.

719
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,960
 We don't know what's gonna happen this afternoon,

720
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,200
 we don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow,

721
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,360
 but Jesus, today you are calling us,

722
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,480
 you're inviting us to receive your shalom,

723
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,900
 your peace within our relationships.

724
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,880
 Father, some of us, we want shalom with you,

725
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,800
 we want to be reconciled with you.

726
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,440
 And for others of us, Lord God,

727
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,220
 we are thinking about certain relationships,

728
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,640
 which you already know, and we want to forgive,

729
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,760
 we want to work through our relationship, Lord God.

730
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,440
 (gentle music)

731
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,460
 And so Father, I pray that your grace today,

732
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,520
 you would give us courage to step,

733
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,100
 take one step into the light of your kindness

734
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,100
 and your grace, and that we would live in it with you,

735
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,360
 that we would experience your grace afresh

736
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,440
 and your kindness afresh through the church

737
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,600
 and through what you're doing in our life.

738
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,240
 And so Father, before we die,

739
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,000
 before each of us finish what we have to do here,

740
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,720
 I pray that you teach us how to forgive those who hurt us.

741
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,800
 I pray that you teach us to forgive ourselves, Lord God,

742
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,140
 and the mistakes that we make.

743
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,560
 And Father, I pray that you remind each of us

744
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,600
 that our Christian faith is a struggle sometimes,

745
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,400
 but it's not struggle with just anything.

746
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,000
 No, it's a conversation, it's a struggle,

747
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
 it's a lament with you.

748
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,000
 We sit with you as you sit with us.

749
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,560
 And so Father, would you give us a wise heart

750
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,480
 to discern how we should spend our time and energy?

751
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,880
 And I pray that we would spend it on people.

752
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,000
 And so Jesus, I just pray that you give us courage

753
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,480
 to live out faith boldly, Jesus, with you

754
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,000
 and in your grace.

755
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
 In your name we pray, amen.
