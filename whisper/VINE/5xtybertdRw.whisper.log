[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   I also want to take this opportunity just to wish all you moms a happy Mother's Day
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.360]   and I hope everyone here knows they're loved and we're so blessed to have you and we're
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.360]   just grateful for you.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:26.120]   Now today we're in the final sermon of our sermon series, resurrection.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.160]   Everything was bothering Justin apparently.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.960]   We're in the final sermon of our sermon series, resurrection hope.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   I hope you've been enjoying that because a lot of times what happens is when you have
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.560]   Easter, you talk about resurrection and Jesus rose and then you move on and a lot of times
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.480]   you don't talk about much more.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.880]   We actually wanted to unpack practically what that means for our lives.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.040]   That's where I want to pick up today and continue.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.080]   To start things off, I want to share something from my teenage years a little while ago.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.680]   I was I think around 15 years, 14 years old and a friend of mine and I, we decided to
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.920]   go on a skiing trip.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.160]   This was a skiing trip that was organized by a local or actually our state skiing association.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.480]   We met all these other youth in Frankfurt and then we drove to Switzerland.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.360]   I don't even remember where we went.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   We drove all the way there.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360]   We got there.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.840]   We step into a youth hostel and that's one of those things where you don't have a million
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   beds in one room.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.400]   There was like eight beds or so in one room.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.000]   My friend, he starts to unpack everything.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.160]   He starts hanging up all his clothes, putting all his socks there, his towel, his pants.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.600]   We had to bring our own bed sheet and bed covers.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.120]   He did all of that stuff.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.240]   Then he went and left the room, went to the bathroom.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.600]   Just when he left, one of the older youth in the room said, "Hey, let's repack his bag."
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.080]   And so he egged everyone on to do it.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:15.040]   They started repacking his bag, packed it all up, which he had just nicely unpacked.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.800]   The message that they were sending was clear, "Go back home."
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.040]   He was the easy one to pick on in that room by the older guy.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.280]   I have to say to my shame, while I didn't participate in putting the stuff in the suitcase,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.040]   I actually did not stand up for my friend.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.120]   It's really bothered me.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.600]   I don't know if you've ever experienced that, where you miss this opportunity to be the
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.440]   person that you want to be.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.040]   I was lacking the courage to just at least try them to stop from doing what they were
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   doing.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.520]   I just carried this deep disappointment in myself and shame.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.840]   I think we all, at one point or another, lack the courage that we wish we would have.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.120]   Where there's these moments in our lives where we want to have courage, but for whatever
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.640]   reason, there can be many reasons.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.720]   We just cannot find the courage to be who we're meant to be.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.040]   We cannot find the courage to do what we're meant to do.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.020]   This might look like things, maybe there's a conversation that we just need to have.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.480]   It just needs to be addressed.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.760]   It's been looming, but we just are not able to have that conversation.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.800]   We lack the courage.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:45.040]   Maybe God is asking us to do something new in our lives, but for so long, we've been
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.920]   doing what we know is wrong.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.040]   We just lack the courage to change and become a different type of person.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.960]   Maybe it has to do with there's this job shift that you perhaps sense the Holy Spirit leading
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   you to take.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.440]   Maybe it's a totally different career.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.880]   It's not the thing you've been doing before, but you lack the courage to make that shift,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.520]   to take that step because there's so many unknowns.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:22.560]   Maybe you need courage for a situation where your life is in shambles.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.320]   Stuff hasn't been working out, and you just find yourself in this heap and this rubble
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.600]   of your life.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.280]   You lack the courage and the ability to move forward and to start afresh or to start new.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.480]   You just don't know what to do.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.120]   Or putting it maybe more positively, maybe there's a coworker where they really need
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.000]   prayer and you have the opportunity to actually pray for them, but you lack the courage to
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.760]   ask them, "Hey, would it be okay if I pray for you?
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.480]   I know you don't believe in Jesus, but I think this really would help you."
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.800]   So you can see there's all these different areas in the ones that you know from your
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:12.840]   own life where we can use courage to be the people that God has created us to be, that
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.040]   God has called us to be, and to do what honors him and what is good and what is right and
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.760]   what is just.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.040]   But for whatever reason, there can be many reasons we struggle to find that courage.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.000]   So what I want to explore with you today in this message is this question, where do we
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   find the courage that we lack?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.720]   Where do you get that courage from?
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.600]   Where can you find that?
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:47.080]   How can we close that gap from who we are and who we want to be or who we need to be?
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.160]   How do you close that gap?
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.600]   And so I want to explore that with you through the topic of resurrection.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.920]   I want to explore that with you from a passage of the Apostle Paul in his letter to the first
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.120]   Corinthians.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.560]   So let me set with you the context a little bit for this letter that Paul wrote before
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.600]   we go into the specific passage.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.360]   So Paul, he planted the church in Corinth.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.360]   So he started it.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.800]   He was there for, I think, roughly two years.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.640]   Then he moved on to plant other churches.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.640]   It's the thing that Paul did.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.360]   He planted churches.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   So at some point in time, he hears about that there is the vision in the church.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   There's conflict.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360]   There's disagreements.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.360]   You know, and of course, that must have broken his heart.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.200]   And then a group of people come and they share with him a letter of questions where there's
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.240]   just all these issues where they're trying to figure out how are we supposed to think
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   about this?
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.040]   We don't know what to do.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.600]   And so Paul then authors the letter of first Corinthians to address all these, the division,
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.680]   to address all these issues.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.200]   And really what he gets at, and I find this absolutely fascinating, is it's helping the
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:04.640]   Corinthian believers think through what the gospel is and what it means to line their
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.860]   lives with the gospel.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.560]   And you can see this even in the structure of his letter, because in chapter one and
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.880]   two, Paul talks about the cross, Jesus's death.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.720]   And then in chapter 15, which is, there's still one chapter, but the chapter 16 is like
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.160]   the postscript of the letter.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.520]   He talks about the resurrection.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.880]   So everything in the letter is between the cross and the resurrection, which is the central
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.000]   part of the gospel message.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.080]   And so we're going to look at chapter 15.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.840]   It's the longest chapter on the resurrection or the most prolonged argument and discussion
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.040]   on that topic in the Bible, chapter 15, first Corinthians.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.960]   I'm going to take you there in a moment, but I'm just going to say this.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.200]   Today it's going to take me a little bit of time to get around to why, how does this relate
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   to courage?
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.840]   Okay, so just stick with me.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   All right.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   Sounds good.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   Thank you.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   All right.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:10.400]   So we are in first Corinthians chapter 15, verse 12, starting there.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.040]   But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.740]   say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:26.420]   And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:34.160]   So the problem that apostle Paul is addressing here is that some are denying the resurrection
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.960]   of the dead.
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.880]   Now they believe the basic gospel proclamation that Christ died on the cross, that he was
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.400]   buried and that he rose.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.280]   Now they affirm that, but they're saying, but I don't believe in the resurrection of
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   the dead.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.400]   And what they're failing to see is that Jesus's resurrection and the resurrection of the dead,
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.840]   they belong together.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.820]   You cannot separate them.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.780]   And so they're undermining the basic message of the gospel.
[00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:09.120]   And Paul wants them to see that and help them think through how that impacts all of their
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.180]   lives and what they do.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:22.000]   And so when the gospel message isn't clear to us, it weakens our faith, hope, and courage.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.440]   I guess I did tie it in here.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:31.840]   Because we don't truly understand the foundation that supports them and what they're based
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.660]   on.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:39.520]   So if we want to be people of courage, we need to understand the gospel message and
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.200]   what that implies for us.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.560]   But a lot of times if we're honest, there's a lot of fuzziness around a lot of things
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.080]   that we believe.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.600]   And if we're fuzzy, then it's hard to have that confidence and that clarity.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.540]   And so today part of my heart is just to also bring some clarity to what the ground is on
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:04.800]   which we stand, in which we can have hope, faith, courage, love, all of those things.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.960]   But let's continue in verse 14.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:13.280]   So here Paul, he unpacks the problem of if you were not to believe in the resurrection
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.920]   of the dead and by implication the resurrection of Jesus, this is what you're left with.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.400]   Ouch.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.800]   More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God for we have testified
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.360]   about God that he raised Christ from the dead, but he did not raise him.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.420]   In fact, the dead are not raised.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.140]   For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:48.240]   And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.100]   You are still in your sins.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.000]   Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.200]   If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   Wow.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.240]   So he's really unpacking the consequences of not affirming the resurrection of Jesus
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.340]   and the resurrection of the dead.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.420]   So if Christ has not been raised, so I have a summary here.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.760]   Christian faith is futile.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   It's empty.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   It's meaningless.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   We are unforgiven and left in our sins.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.400]   Those who have died in Christian hope, they've died on a false hope.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.400]   They're lost.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:36.800]   Those who currently hope in Christ are most to be pitied because their hope is fake.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.160]   So in other words, Christianity without Christ's resurrection doesn't make any sense.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.920]   Christianity without the resurrection of the dead doesn't make any sense.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   You know, it belongs together.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.080]   We cannot separate that.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   But if Christ has been raised, all those negatives, they turn into positives.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.080]   So I have those as well.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.440]   Our faith counts.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.120]   Our sins are forgiven.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.700]   Those who died believing Jesus, they will be raised.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:10.980]   And those who currently hope and trust in Christ are to be envied since God's power
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:18.920]   is at work in them and they have hope now, but also beyond death.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.520]   So the point that Paul is making is that the resurrection of Christ isn't just one belief
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.800]   among many that you can kind of like, "Oh, you know, it doesn't matter what I believe
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   on this."
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.880]   No, it matters.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.000]   It's not just one belief among many.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.160]   It's the very thing that gives meaning and power to everything else that we believe.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.840]   And to be fuzzy about that or to have the wrong understanding or to affirm that, it's
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.480]   like cutting the legs from underneath our faith.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.480]   Everything collapses.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:59.640]   And so Paul is addressing this misunderstanding and he's explaining that the basics of the
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.560]   gospel message on which the ground in which we can have new life in Christ, the ground
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.760]   on which our sins are forgiven, the ground on which we can have hope, the ground on which
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:19.880]   we have faith, the ground, yes, on which we can have courage to live the life that Jesus
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.900]   calls us to live, has created us to live.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:36.080]   And so Jesus' bodily resurrection gives us hope and it shows us also something very significant.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.040]   Like during that time, there was a negative view regarding the material world, that it
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.840]   was corrupt.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.400]   And the way salvation was understood in a Greco-Roman world was that the soul was meant
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.320]   to escape the body.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:59.720]   So when Christianity affirms the material world, yes, it's corrupted by sin, but God
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.560]   will redeem the corrupted creation from sin.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:10.880]   So when Jesus' body is raised, it shows that God is also affirming his good creation.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.040]   Because in the Hebrew mindset, creation in the material world is good.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.000]   Yes, it's impacted by sin, but it's good.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:25.560]   And God one day will renew, restore all things, all of creation.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.400]   And so Paul, he put it differently.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.440]   What Paul wanted the Corinthians to understand is this, Jesus' resurrection was not simply
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.800]   God's miraculous intervention that rescued him from death.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.320]   So it was not just something for Jesus and for nobody else, but it was the beginning
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.840]   of God's renewal of all things.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.040]   It's like the turning point, everything starts changing.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:59.280]   Resurrection is a central piece of God's redemptive and restorative work for all of his creation.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:05.760]   And so it really is that turning point where you have, when you look at the biblical grand
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.560]   narrative, you have the fall, well, you have creation, then you have the fall into sin,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.280]   then you have the story of redemption.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:20.480]   And it culminates in Jesus dying and rising, and then also in Jesus coming again.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.960]   So this is the turning point.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.920]   And it doesn't just have implications for Jesus, but for everyone else, for this world,
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   for us.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.280]   And so Paul is saying, you cannot separate us.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.440]   This belongs together as part of the same gospel story, good news message.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.200]   But let's continue because Paul does affirm that Christ rose.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.440]   So in verse 20, it says this, "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.200]   first fruits of those who have fallen asleep."
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.720]   So talking about those who were dead.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:55.760]   "For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.520]   For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.400]   Now if you're like, this sounds familiar, it should because Pastor Chapman preached
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.200]   about it two weeks ago, this passage here.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:16.440]   But I'm going to highlight something from a little bit of a different angle.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.200]   The first thing is, I mean, the first fruits, so Pastor Chapman talked about that, I'll
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.320]   repeat that briefly.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.400]   So first fruits is the first fruits of a harvest, like the first apple that's ripe, the first
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.780]   wheat that's ripe.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:37.080]   And Paul compares the resurrection to first fruits, which means there's more to follow.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.360]   Just like in a harvest, you know, after the first fruits there's more to follow, with
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.200]   Christ's resurrection there is more to follow.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.840]   Because it's just the beginning of something new that God has inaugurated, that he has
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.040]   begun.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:58.920]   And what's going to follow is the renewal of all things, including the resurrection
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.560]   of the dead.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.640]   But then the second thing is, and this he shifts the metaphor, he talks about being
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.280]   in Adam and being in Christ.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.320]   And we, all of us, either we participate with a life in Adam or we participate in a life
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.320]   of Christ.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.240]   And so there's no in between room.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.400]   And Adam means we're under sin, we're under the fall, you know, and we will need to deal
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   with the consequence.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:34.720]   But if we are in Christ, that means we have been raised from death to new life in Christ.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.800]   And so we now get to participate in this new life that Christ has brought.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.600]   And you know, our story has changed.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.240]   We're not no longer living the story of Adam, we're living now the story of Christ.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:53.760]   And I know I noticed this a little bit abstract, I'm going to get to the practical.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:00.800]   But one thing I want to highlight here is at the end of verse 22, it talks about the
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.960]   future reality of the resurrection.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.140]   Because it talks about that those who are in Christ will be made alive, future.
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.640]   But that's not the only way the Bible talks about the resurrection, because it also talks
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.140]   about the present reality of the resurrection.
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.040]   And so does Paul, where he talks about us being made alive in Christ now.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.600]   So I want to read a passage from you from Ephesians 2, verse 4.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:33.520]   It says, "But because of this great love for us, God was rich in mercy, made us alive
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.840]   with Christ, even when we were dead in our transgressions.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.920]   It is by grace you have been saved, and God raised us up with Christ and seated us with
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.680]   him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus."
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.560]   So here it's the present reality.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.960]   We were made alive for Christ.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.400]   We were dead in our sins.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.240]   Ephesians, before Paul came, proclaimed the gospel, they were dead in their sins.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.780]   They were under Adam.
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.160]   But because they believed, they repented of their sins and they placed their faith in
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.880]   Jesus, they were made alive with Christ.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   Present reality, God's power at work, raising believers to new life, bringing transformation,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.280]   bringing change, giving the gift of his Holy Spirit.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:24.840]   Every believer is filled with the Spirit and receives the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.760]   And so now we're on a different trajectory.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.520]   We can live differently.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.960]   And so that's really what I want to focus with you on today, is the present reality
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.400]   of the resurrection and how that impacts our life.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:46.000]   You know, the power of God here and now that raised Jesus from the dead is the same power
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   that is at work in your life if you believe in him.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:59.080]   So you have that same power at work, not just when you become a Christian, but as you continue
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.800]   to live the life of following Jesus.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.400]   Well, let's continue.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:15.240]   So Paul, he, and this is the final section we're going to look at in this letter, he
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:21.600]   draws out two more, he gives two examples of two practices that the Corinthians practiced
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.640]   that do not make sense if you don't believe that Jesus rose.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.240]   Like it just would not make sense.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.520]   And so we're going to look at the second one.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.600]   I think that's the easier one to understand.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.240]   It's from Paul's own life, his own ministry.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.360]   And it stands under the heading that now if there is no resurrection, so let's pick it
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.800]   up in verse 30.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:55.520]   And as for us, now if there is no resurrection, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.280]   I face death every day.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.960]   Yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:08.340]   If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained?
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:13.040]   If the dead are not raised, let us eat, drink, for tomorrow we die.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:19.640]   He's actually quoting a philosopher from the time.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:28.400]   So Paul is saying like, if Christ has not been raised, then me and my coworkers risking
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.600]   our lives, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   Why would we do that?
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.480]   That's just stupid.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.400]   Moreover, he says in verse 31, I face death every day.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.880]   Now a more literal translation of this there, I die daily.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.280]   So it's actually in reference to Jesus, his self-giving love.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:53.080]   So I'm living this death to self to serve other people, to build other people up, to
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.880]   bring them the flourishing, to bring them the faith.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:05.200]   And if I do this every day, but Jesus didn't rise, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   Because why would you do that?
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.840]   Then let's just all have a party and just seize the day, carpe diem, enjoy this life
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   and that's it.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.520]   Drink, eat, be merry.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:26.700]   But that is not the case because Paul affirms that Christ did rise.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:35.600]   And so I want to bring us back to the question that we asked at the beginning of the message.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.720]   Where do we find courage?
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.760]   Where do we find the courage that we lack?
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:49.960]   We find it because Jesus died and rose and because that shifts our perspective on how
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.420]   we live now.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:59.640]   It shifts our perspective even beyond death and God by his spirit, by his Holy Spirit
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:05.880]   can empower us to have courage and to live lives that we could not live out of our own
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   strength.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.480]   I want to give two examples of how we can experience the present reality of the resurrection
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.320]   of Jesus in our lives now.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.680]   Now that can help us live the courageous lives and be the courageous people that God has
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.060]   created us to be.
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:27.000]   The first one is this, we can find courage for our lives in a personal relationship with
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.760]   Jesus.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.160]   That really is the starting point.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.920]   The power of sin when you repent of our faith and place our trust in him is broken.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.620]   The Bible talks about that we crossed over from death to life.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.860]   The Holy Spirit has given you new birth, new life.
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.700]   You are a new creation.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.040]   Something has shifted, something has changed.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.480]   What has separated you between you and God has been removed.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.700]   You now have access to the Father.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:05.160]   You are a child, a son, a daughter of God.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.640]   You can live in that relationship and that intimacy with the Father, the Son, and the
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.160]   Holy Spirit.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:19.880]   When we live in that relationship, now as Christians it doesn't mean that we're always
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.200]   are drawing close to God.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.760]   We don't always live intimately in that relationship.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:32.360]   But when we do that, when we draw close and we pray and we talk to God and we get to know
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.960]   God more through his word and we seek God together with other people and we just enjoy
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:47.200]   his presence, that brings so much assurance to our hearts, to our minds.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:56.120]   I had this picture of if I as a little child would face some dangerous situation on my
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.580]   own, it's quite scary.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:05.560]   But if my father stands right here and I'm facing the same situation, it's quite different,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.800]   right?
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:14.560]   Because when we have a relationship with Jesus, when we are children of God, when we have
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.400]   a heavenly Father, we are not facing the circumstance alone.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.560]   The Lord is with us.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.720]   We can know his presence.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.440]   And having his presence with us and operating from the ground of being in that relationship
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.320]   versus on our own can transform how we engage it.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.840]   Because now we're not engaging it alone, we're engaging it with our heavenly Father.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.720]   So it gives us that ground for courage.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.640]   We're not facing the giants on our own.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.640]   We're facing them with God who is so much bigger, so much more powerful, so much more
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.120]   mighty than whatever it is that we're facing.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.240]   But we only know that when we dwell, when we live in that intimacy.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:05.040]   As I was praying for us, it was a couple of days ago, I had this image and I was of a
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.120]   child, which I think makes sense.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.480]   I'm a parent of a young child.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.240]   So I think God speaks to us in ways that make sense to us, right?
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:20.160]   I had this image of a child and it was just crying, just tears and screaming.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:26.320]   And it was running to the Father, into the Father's arms.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.440]   It was anxious, it was unsettled.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.160]   And I just really had to sense that some of us here today were living in that anxiousness
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.080]   and in that unsettledness.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.640]   And we've been sitting in that.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.840]   And that God is inviting us like a child to run into the Father's arms, to allow ourselves
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.080]   to be embraced by our heavenly Father.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:57.080]   And that's in that relationship with our Father and by being embraced, that the fear, the
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:04.600]   anxiety, whatever is weighing on your heart, it melts away.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.480]   So I just sensed that some of you are being invited to run into the Father's arms.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:19.480]   You've been somewhere else and it's time to draw close and just sit in God's arms in
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:30.040]   his presence and to take away your anxieties, your worries, as you just settle in his love
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.960]   and who he is, because he loves you and he is with you.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.000]   You are not alone.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.240]   But we're so anxious and frantic, we just lose sight of that.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:50.320]   So if that's you, I want to encourage you to do that, to run into the Father's arms.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:57.880]   The second way that we can find the courage that we lack is to face our, we can face our
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:05.680]   challenge because God's power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in your life.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.800]   When we become a Christian, we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.840]   Now, a lot of times we can operate out of our own strength and I think we all have that
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   tendency.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.440]   We're going to try to solve this out of our own means, out of our own strength.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:26.800]   And so many times you don't go and surrender to God and surrender to the work of the Holy
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.040]   Spirit in our lives.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:38.080]   And when we try to do things out of our own strength, we can't find the courage within
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   ourselves.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.680]   On social media, they probably tell you, "Find courage inside yourself."
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.560]   But you're not going to find it inside yourself.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.560]   You're going to find it in God.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.880]   You're going to find it in the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:55.920]   And I have this, one of my favorite authors, he recently passed away, philosopher, Dallas
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.920]   Willard.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.440]   He tells a story in one of my favorite books, The Divine Conspiracy, and he writes this.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.760]   I want to share this story with you.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760]   He says this.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.040]   He recounts a story from his childhood.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:12.520]   So as a child, I lived in an area of southern Missouri where electricity was available only
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.240]   in the form of lightning.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:23.560]   But in my senior year of high school, the REA, Rural Electrification Administration,
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:29.400]   that's a mouthful right there, right, extended its lines into the area where we lived.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.000]   And electrical power became available to households and farms.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:41.520]   And when those lines came by our farm, a very different way of life presented itself.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:51.280]   A relationship to fundamental aspects of life, daylight and dark, hot and cold, clean and
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.920]   dirty, work and leisure, preparing food and preserving it.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.280]   You know, all of that changes with electricity.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.920]   Because now you have a different power source that impacts all of those things.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.800]   Like, you can have light, you can have electricity for a fridge, you can have electricity for
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.160]   power tools.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.400]   And so electricity had the potential to change everything for the better.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.920]   But we still had to believe in the electricity and its arrangements, understand them, and
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.960]   take the practical steps involved in relying on it.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:33.740]   And he goes on to share that not every one of their neighbors took the step to be connected
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.360]   to the electrical grid.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.000]   Not everyone did it.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.040]   And becoming a follower of Jesus, becoming alive to God, it's like being connected to
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   the electrical grid.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.360]   It's that you get the gift of the Spirit of God.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.720]   You have the Spirit of God running through your body.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.760]   But it doesn't mean that we're always relying on the work of the Spirit and are surrendered
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:02.880]   and submitted to the Spirit and asking God for strength.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:09.360]   And so we need to, even as Christians, we need to connect ourselves to the source and
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:18.040]   allow the Spirit of God to give us the strength, the courage, the hope, the faith that we lack,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:29.760]   and we do lack it, to deal with the challenges, the worries, the situations, so we can face
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.320]   them and have the grace and the strength to face them.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.720]   Some of the challenges by the power of God who raised Jesus from the dead, that's that
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:44.800]   power that is at work in your life.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.760]   God can remove obstacles in our life.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.640]   He can do that if he wants to.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.440]   Now sometimes they still remain.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.080]   They don't just always go away.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:00.880]   But what's different is that we now, no longer out of our own strength face the situation,
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:07.160]   but we face the situation by the power of God, the Spirit of God giving us the grace
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.200]   and the strength to face them.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.880]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:25.560]   And I want to invite us to actually respond to what I shared, because for some of us we
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.640]   are sitting right now in anxiety.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.560]   We are restless, and maybe there's even been tears even last night, maybe even this morning.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:41.120]   Now it's just been a tear-filled week.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:48.080]   And our Heavenly Father is inviting us to run into his arms, to sit and embrace our
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:56.920]   Heavenly Father, and to let our fears and our anxiety be melted away in his love.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:04.640]   And to restore our peace, which is also the work of the Holy Spirit, to give us peace
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:12.960]   when there's chaos all around us, to restore joy where we lost joy.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.600]   So that's the first way that I want to invite people to respond.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:23.200]   The second way is this, that if you are facing a challenging situation where you need courage,
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.960]   if you have that conversation you need to have, if you are facing that decision, if
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.080]   you are missing opportunities you actually want to seize, I want to encourage both those
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.240]   running into the Father's arms and those needing that courage to just stretch out your hands
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.560]   before you.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.760]   And so I want to invite you to do this right now, just as a sign of openness to God and
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.080]   longing for him to meet you and to receive from him.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:54.840]   And what I want to ask us as a family, as a church family to do is actually to go to
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:00.240]   those that we see who have their arms stretched out and to just pray over them.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.080]   You can ask them how to pray, you can just pray, just keep it simple.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.280]   And we're going to take five or so minutes to do that and then I'll bring us back.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.080]   So let's do this right now, let's pray for each other.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.520]   Let's do this, church.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.840]   So you can get up and if you see somebody with their hands stretched out just go and
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.360]   pray for them.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.440]   (laughs)
