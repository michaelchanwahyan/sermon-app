1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Well, good morning, Church.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,120
 It's really good to be with you all today.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,440
 I'm excited to come and share the Word with you.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,000
 So we're just going to get right into it, all right?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,520
 Let me start with a question.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,520
 As you've been walking around the streets here in Hong Kong, have you ever seen people

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,560
 on the streets trying to sell something?

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,000
 It's quite a common sight where we are.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,880
 You know, actually right in the corner of Wan Chai Road, there's a little space next

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,400
 to the Cha Siu place.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,160
 There's a little space and it's always rented out.

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,680
 And you know, it's always rented out to people who are trying to sell different things.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 There's always someone trying to sell something out of that spot.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,000
 I've seen frying pans, Chinese herbs, mops, diffusers, these magic cloths that seem to

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,200
 be able to clean everything, cushion covers, sometimes it's lavender, compression socks,

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,000
 underwear sometimes, and most recently, RAT test kits and face masks.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,800
 These like $6 RAT test kits.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,200
 I don't know how reliable they are, okay?

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,880
 $6 apparently.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,320
 But I love watching these people because they have a way to work the crowd.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,600
 They know how to make a sale.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,280
 And after you observe them for a little while, you figure out there's a method in what they're

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,900
 doing.

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,560
 So it goes a bit like this, okay?

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,000
 First, they're very good at getting the attention of just one or two people.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,400
 You know, often they're just kind of like talking to themselves, kind of like practicing

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,160
 the sales pitch, I guess, but inevitably, there's always one slightly middle-aged person

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,120
 that comes walking along, you know, the old man that's kind of walking like this, you

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,040
 know, and he kind of comes along and they make the very, very big mistake of showing

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,000
 the slightest bit of interest and suddenly, boom, they're hooked.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 [foreign language]

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,160
 You know, and one slight bit of interest and they're hooked, all right?

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
 And then comes the sales pitch.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,760
 And these are where these people really excel because whatever it is they're selling, they

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,920
 can make it seem like you need it desperately right now.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,880
 And not only you, right, your whole entire family needs this as well.

37
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,080
 You're going to, and if you don't buy it right now, you're going to miss a once in a lifetime

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,880
 opportunity.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,280
 And all they need, again, is just one person, one person to make a purchase, right?

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
 And then that's it.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
 You're allowed to begin to gather, right?

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,840
 Even during the pandemic, Hong Kong people love to gather together if there is a deal

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
 in place, right?

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,560
 Gather together and block the entire pavement.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,640
 And after that, one person makes the sale, one person choose to make the purchase, then

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,880
 the rest fall like flies, right?

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,160
 They're handing over fistfuls of cash, "Hey, I need this, I need this," and grabbing as

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,800
 many as they can.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
 And that's how I ended up with five USB-powered tabletop blenders that apparently you can

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,720
 put all your vegetables and fruit in.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,640
 You know, it's a really easy way to have your fruit and veg and healthy way to keep, maintain

52
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
 a balanced diet.

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,120
 And if you want one of those, today I'm offering you a once in a lifetime opportunity, all

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,120
 right?

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,160
 Just slide into my DMs, 70 Hong Kong dollars, all right, and you can have one.

56
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,720
 I've got them orange, pink, and red, whatever color you want.

57
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,200
 I can sort you out for that too.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,240
 You know, Pastor Andrew started us on a journey through Acts a couple of weeks ago, and we

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,580
 continue on this journey today.

60
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,360
 But the question we have at hand today is this, how do we share the gospel?

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,400
 Sometimes, sometimes sharing the gospel, right, does feel like we're salesperson trying to

62
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,400
 make a sales pitch, convince these people that we have something that they need.

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,960
 Maybe if Peter was working in that corner, he'd be selling something like this, right?

64
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,320
 Come and buy the most comfortable sandals this side of the Galilee, the one and only

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,760
 Jerusalem cruisers, you know, whether you are walking on the Red Sea or hiking up to

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,680
 the Temple Mount, these sandals are the only things that you'll ever need.

67
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,640
 I should probably get a part-time job at that place, right?

68
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,960
 But what Peter's doing, he's not selling a gimmicky product in this speech.

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,460
 Now his speech is courageous, provocative, and truly life-changing to those who choose

70
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,480
 to respond to it, because Peter is proclaiming the gospel.

71
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,380
 So let me just give you a quick reminder of what's happened up until this point.

72
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,640
 If you remember, it's Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit has come, and the disciples are speaking

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,560
 in these foreign languages, and people are kind of reconciling in a way that they've

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,480
 never seen before.

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,920
 But also some people think, "What's going on here?

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
 It's absolutely crazy."

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,920
 Some people are amazed, some people think that the disciples are drunk, but Peter explains,

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
 "No, people are not drunk.

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,480
 This is not crazy, but rather it's the Holy Spirit that is at work in this moment.

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:58,260
 And because the Holy Spirit is at work, you need to listen to what I'm about to tell you."

81
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,900
 And so my hope for us today is this.

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:07,680
 As we study Peter's declaration of the gospel, we will all be inspired to do the same.

83
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,900
 After all, for those of you who are Christian, for those of you who follow Jesus with your

84
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,880
 lives, isn't the gospel the best news that you've ever received?

85
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,900
 And surely if this is the best news that we've ever received, we want other people to know

86
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,520
 just how amazing it is.

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,920
 You know, the heartache that we've gone through as a city, the disunity that we've seen within

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,760
 our society, the mistrust between people groups, and the general sense of hopelessness as we

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,240
 look into the future, there is an answer to these things.

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,200
 We desperately need to heal, and we're crying out for hope as a family and as a city.

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:53,420
 And one of the best ways I believe we can bring hope into a time like this is to proclaim

92
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,420
 the gospel.

93
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:00,820
 Now, of course, it's not an easy thing to do, and the thought of sharing the gospel

94
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,760
 might be super intimidating.

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,920
 You might even say, you know, "Well, evangelism is just not my thing.

96
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,620
 I'm going to leave that to the people who are good at it to do that."

97
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,020
 But the point of today is to challenge that perspective a little bit, church.

98
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,080
 Because telling people about the gospel is really something all of us can do, and I would

99
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,120
 even say have been called to do.

100
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,580
 And hopefully today we're going to learn some methods and some tactics just to encourage

101
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,880
 and to empower you a little bit more to this call that God has given to you to share the

102
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
 gospel.

103
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,960
 We're going to turn to God's word in order to be able to do that.

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,500
 So we're going to be in Acts 2, starting in verse 22.

105
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 Follow with me, church.

106
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,300
 It says this, "Fellow Israelites, listen to this.

107
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:56,460
 Jesus of Nazareth, a man accredited to you by God by miracles, wonders, and signs, which

108
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,520
 God did among you through him.

109
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,500
 As you yourselves know, this man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge,

110
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,200
 and you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross.

111
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,540
 But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death because it was

112
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,800
 impossible for death to hold him down."

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,320
 Have you ever had a moment when you were in the middle of a conversation and then suddenly

114
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,640
 you just get this undeniable urge to talk about Jesus?

115
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,660
 I think I spoke about this the last time I preached a little bit, right?

116
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,540
 But you feel it in your chest, your brain kind of zooms in on it.

117
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,800
 You might start to feel a little bit nervous or excited even.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,860
 Your heart starts to beat a little bit faster because at this moment you are sure, you know

119
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,560
 there's an opportunity to share the gospel.

120
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,520
 Now what do we do in those moments?

121
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,420
 It can be a little conflicting, right?

122
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,240
 Because like I said, on the one hand you're excited and you're keen to share the gospel.

123
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,520
 However, on the other hand you might be thinking, "Well what if these people think I'm weird?

124
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,040
 What if I get rejected?

125
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,520
 What if it comes off as like this cheesy sales pitch?"

126
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,320
 But we can take notes from Peter here.

127
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,160
 Notice how Peter reacts to this situation.

128
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,880
 Peter rises to the occasion.

129
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,680
 That's the first step we have to take.

130
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
 When the opportunity comes, we have to rise to the occasion.

131
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,160
 And he begins to explain and unpack what is happening.

132
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,800
 He makes the most of this moment to proclaim the truth of the gospel to anybody who's willing

133
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,400
 to listen to it.

134
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,440
 Now again, you might be thinking, "Well that was Peter, right?

135
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,720
 Peter was Jesus' best mate.

136
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,280
 He followed Jesus around.

137
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,960
 There was no big deal for Peter to do something like that."

138
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,320
 But again, we have to remember, Peter wasn't always this bold person.

139
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,280
 Peter was in fact a man of many, many failures.

140
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,840
 He was impatient and hot-headed.

141
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,960
 He often said the wrong thing.

142
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,880
 Just look at his track record, you know.

143
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,200
 He starts to walk on the water but loses faith and begins to drown.

144
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,680
 He falls asleep when he's supposed to be praying, something that I relate to very, very much

145
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,480
 indeed.

146
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,960
 The night before Jesus was crucified, he denies he knows Jesus on three different occasions.

147
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,760
 And after Jesus' death, Peter is so down, he almost gives up on his mission altogether

148
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,800
 and goes back to fishing.

149
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:36,320
 Peter was a sinful, broken human being just like us.

150
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,740
 But yet he learned what it meant to be bold and courageous when it came to declaring the

151
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,080
 truth of who Jesus is and what he had done.

152
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,560
 It might feel like the work of sharing the gospel is reserved for a select few people

153
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
 who are good at it.

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,960
 We might not even feel like we're qualified to speak about Jesus because of things we

155
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,420
 feel like we've done in our past.

156
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,200
 But this is a reminder for us, church.

157
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,840
 And Peter's example is proof that when you're willing to share the gospel, you're not just

158
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
 doing it in your own power.

159
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,580
 But the Holy Spirit comes upon you and empowers you and guides you and gives you the confidence

160
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,820
 and the words to speak in those moments.

161
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,840
 Despite of all of Peter's shortcomings, through the Holy Spirit, he was empowered to share

162
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,680
 the gospel.

163
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,840
 And that's why I believe every single person, including you, yes, you and me and every single

164
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,360
 person who decides to be brave, who decides to let the Holy Spirit work through them,

165
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,040
 can also share the gospel in those moments of opportunity.

166
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,440
 So you've recognized the moment.

167
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,740
 You know that there's an opportunity that needs to be seized.

168
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,280
 Now what?

169
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,800
 What do you actually say?

170
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,400
 Well, step two is this, church.

171
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,540
 When you open your mouth, you declare the life, death, and the resurrection of Jesus.

172
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,320
 These three things, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, are crucial components when it comes

173
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,460
 to presenting the gospel.

174
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,520
 And I'm going to get a little bit theological but also a bit practical here.

175
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,600
 So please stay with me, church.

176
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
 Listen again to Peter's words.

177
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,520
 Firstly, verse 22, he declares who Jesus is.

178
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,640
 Fellow Israelites, listen to this.

179
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,920
 Jesus of Nazareth, a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which

180
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,760
 God did among you through him.

181
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,560
 What Peter's doing here is Peter's acknowledging Jesus' existence as a real person.

182
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,720
 He's saying, "You knew this man.

183
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 You've seen him.

184
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,720
 You've seen him.

185
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 He lived among you.

186
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
 He breathed the same air.

187
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
 He ate the same food.

188
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
 He slept.

189
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,440
 He was functioning among you.

190
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
 You've seen him with your own eyes."

191
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,520
 Jesus from Nazareth, that's how people identified themselves back in the day.

192
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,240
 But at the same time, Jesus wasn't just an ordinary man, right?

193
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,800
 He performed signs and wonders and miracles.

194
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,080
 And when we read through the gospels, we see Jesus was indeed able to do things that no

195
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,200
 other person could do.

196
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,640
 He gives sight to the blind.

197
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,960
 He makes the lame walk again.

198
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,040
 He approaches lepers to make them clean.

199
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,480
 He gives voice to the mute.

200
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,680
 He casts out evil spirits.

201
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,760
 And yes, he even raises the dead back to life.

202
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,880
 And Peter's saying here, "All these miracles are proof that even though Jesus was a man

203
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
 that lived among us, he wasn't an ordinary man.

204
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,600
 Rather, a man who was so filled with the power of presence of God, it was as if God himself

205
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,760
 was living amongst us."

206
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,480
 Jesus says this in John 15, 9, about John 5, 19, sorry, about himself.

207
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,480
 "Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself.

208
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,760
 He can only do what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does, the Son

209
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,120
 does also."

210
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,760
 What Peter's trying to do and what we need to understand is that, yes, these miracles

211
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,200
 that Jesus performed in the course of his life and his ministry are proof that Jesus

212
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,680
 was uniquely God's Son sent by him to this earth.

213
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,160
 So how do we declare Jesus with our lives today?

214
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,800
 Well, there's a few different ways.

215
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,480
 Firstly, we need to learn how to actually talk about him.

216
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,440
 This means we need to read our Bibles, spend time in God's Word, especially spend time

217
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,160
 in the Gospels, fall in love with the stories of Jesus, practice telling stories about the

218
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,120
 things that he did, because they are truly amazing.

219
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,760
 As followers of Jesus, talking about him should be like talking about your best friend, your

220
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,800
 spouse, your partner, your child, someone that you admire deeply.

221
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,320
 Also learn and practice how to talk and share stories about Jesus.

222
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,840
 But we can't just talk about it, church.

223
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,040
 We also need to live our lives as Jesus lived.

224
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,840
 Let me say something very clear at this point.

225
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,160
 Preaching the Gospel has to be done with more than just our words.

226
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,760
 Now I know, most of us aren't going around doing supernatural miracles on the daily,

227
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,080
 we don't do those kind of things, but we all have giftings and talents, things we're good

228
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,440
 at, which we can use towards proclaiming who Jesus is.

229
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,080
 We can use these things to love and serve people in the same way that we see Jesus did

230
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
 in the Gospels.

231
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,120
 How are you, church, using these God-given gifts and abilities to reach out to those

232
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:51,480
 who are hurting, to feed the hungry, to seek justice for those who are lost in darkness?

233
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,920
 The way we live should reflect who Jesus is.

234
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,460
 This is how we become the hands and feet of Christ today.

235
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,000
 Along with our words, our actions point people towards Jesus.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,440
 And when we do this, it's like we're replicating the miracles of Jesus.

237
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,400
 It's like these people are so different.

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,520
 Why is this person helping me?

239
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:19,760
 Doing these things, it's like doing the miracles that Jesus did while He was here on this earth.

240
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,280
 And this is what a life empowered by the Gospel looks like.

241
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,760
 So yes, Jesus lived a powerful life while He was on this earth, and He's called us to

242
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
 do the same.

243
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,160
 But one of the most astonishing things about Jesus is that even in death, even in His death,

244
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,200
 there was great power.

245
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,200
 Let's read on to see what Peter says.

246
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:50,000
 This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge, and you, with the

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,200
 help of wicked men, put Him to death by nailing Him to the cross.

248
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,880
 Peter's talking about sin and death here.

249
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,040
 The death of Jesus is probably the most tragic and unjust event in the entire course of history

250
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,820
 of the world.

251
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,760
 As we have discovered, we've just said Jesus was sent by God on this earth to teach us,

252
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,880
 to guide us, to love us, to save us.

253
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,480
 But we also see that while Jesus was on this earth, He was often despised.

254
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,600
 He was often rejected by the very ones who He was called to love.

255
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:34,280
 Nevertheless, Jesus comes, full well knowing that sinful human beings would be the ones

256
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:40,600
 who execute Him through the brutal method of crucifixion.

257
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,360
 Yet He came to love.

258
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,700
 But here's the amazing thing.

259
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,160
 At the same time, even though we crucified Jesus on the cross, His death becomes the

260
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,240
 ultimate sign of victory.

261
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,920
 This is one of the paradoxes of Jesus' death.

262
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
 In the commentary I found it said it like this.

263
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,200
 It was engineered and carried out by human beings, whilst at the same time it was the

264
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,360
 climax of God's plan of salvation.

265
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,420
 And this is why if you read stories about Jesus, He was able to talk about His death

266
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,560
 so freely.

267
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,740
 This is why Jesus continued His journey to the cross despite all the pain and humiliation

268
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,640
 that He felt along the way.

269
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,240
 This is why even while He was on the cross about to die, He was able to minister to the

270
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,800
 women around Him.

271
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,560
 He was able to talk to the thief crying out for rescue, even though He Himself was about

272
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,300
 to die.

273
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,060
 This is why His last words on the cross were, "It is finished."

274
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,760
 Because He knew that through His death, the greatest rescue mission in the world had been

275
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,760
 accomplished.

276
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:55,120
 Yes, church, sin and death are very much part of the gospel story.

277
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,720
 And when we see the way Jesus lived, when we see the way Jesus talked, He was never

278
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,800
 afraid to talk about the different ways that we as human beings have messed up and sinned.

279
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,560
 He was never afraid to point out the effects of sin.

280
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,200
 Scripture is very clear.

281
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,280
 All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

282
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,200
 And the wages of those sin is death.

283
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,780
 So this is what this means for us.

284
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:27,560
 The gospel means that we have to embrace those who are lost in sin, not being afraid of the

285
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,360
 messiness that might come with it.

286
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,040
 This means again, speaking up against systems of cruelty and injustice.

287
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,800
 This means standing with the weak and the vulnerable and the oppressed because this

288
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,880
 is exactly what Jesus did in His life.

289
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,000
 All this too is part of proclaiming the gospel.

290
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,840
 But church, this does not mean that we go around bashing and condemning people for their

291
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,440
 sin, threatening them with the punishment of hell.

292
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:04,080
 Yes, sin is serious and it needs to be dealt with, but it's not done by Christians judging,

293
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,240
 pointing fingers, acting haughty and holier than thou.

294
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,120
 In fact, I would say this, one of the best ways to talk about sin is to share and be

295
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,880
 honest about your own struggles.

296
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,120
 Because we as Christians, we have a tendency maybe to perhaps that we are above these things,

297
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,840
 that we don't have any issues, pretend like we're immune to the life's challenges and

298
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,240
 the things that are happening around us.

299
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,680
 And it can give up the impression that we have it all figured out, but if we're just

300
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:41,560
 honest with ourselves for just one second, this is clearly not the case.

301
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,320
 So when you speak about the gospel, speak also about your own brokenness.

302
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:52,120
 Acknowledge that the gospel is something you need just as much as anyone else.

303
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,480
 And hopefully you'll find, you know, as we approach the conversation from this perspective,

304
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,280
 right, of this is what the gospel has done for me, rather than you're a sin that needs

305
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,600
 to hear about Jesus, I think you'll find that people are a lot more open to hearing you

306
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,680
 out.

307
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,360
 And yes, these things are going to be hard to talk about.

308
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,080
 It's going to take courage to be open and to be vulnerable.

309
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,560
 It's going to be a risk, but it's a risk worth taking because people need to know that sin

310
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,220
 and death are not the end.

311
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,480
 We need people to know that the gospel is actually a triumphant message of love and

312
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,840
 hope.

313
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,560
 So let's be honest.

314
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,880
 Let's be vulnerable.

315
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,160
 But let's also proclaim that because we can be open and honest about these things, we

316
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,240
 don't need to be a slave to sin and death.

317
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,080
 And we're not afraid of these things because in the gospel, death actually becomes a victory.

318
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,760
 Jesus is alive and we can do and say and act to these things and love people in this way

319
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,400
 because we have the hope of resurrection.

320
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,200
 Listen to these powerful and triumphant words Peter continues with.

321
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,460
 But God raised him, that's Jesus from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death

322
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,880
 because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.

323
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,960
 If the death of Jesus is one of the most tragic and unjust things, the resurrection from Jesus

324
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,640
 is one of the most mysterious and yet wonderful truths about our Christian faith.

325
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,880
 Yes, church, Jesus died on the cross.

326
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,320
 But the reason we have hope, the reason we know that he wasn't just an ordinary man is

327
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:43,320
 that what Peter has just said here, it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.

328
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,000
 You have to understand this, right?

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,440
 Nobody is supposed to be able to escape death.

330
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,760
 Nobody.

331
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,860
 Death is like a prison that once you go in, there's no coming back.

332
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,980
 Dead people do not generally escape death and come back to life.

333
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,780
 The reason why we as a church, we as followers of Jesus can confront this thing of sin and

334
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:13,820
 even death is because, like I said, we have the reassurance of the resurrection.

335
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,900
 The key to the gospel message is the declaration that as his followers, we too can share with

336
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,800
 Jesus in his resurrection.

337
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,260
 Peter really wants to drive this home.

338
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,440
 And if you continue to read in Acts chapter 2, he goes into Psalm 16 and a few other Psalms

339
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,300
 written by King David and he points out that King David himself, right, he was the archetype

340
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,260
 leader of Israel back then.

341
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:46,260
 But King David himself once prophesied about who Jesus is and what he would do.

342
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,100
 Peter explains to his audience that these Psalms that King David writes about future

343
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,260
 resurrection wasn't about himself, but it was actually a prophecy about Jesus's coming

344
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,700
 and his resurrection.

345
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,900
 And this was to be the ultimate sign.

346
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,580
 The ultimate sign that would let all of Israel know that their Savior had returned, that

347
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:14,100
 the wait was finally over, would be the resurrection of Jesus.

348
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,940
 So the resurrection, therefore, church, is what gives the gospel power.

349
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,460
 The resurrection lets us know that a new era has begun.

350
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,260
 The kingdom of God is finally here.

351
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,580
 And as we wait for Jesus to return for the second time, we get to do the work of spreading

352
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,620
 the gospel, of bringing his kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.

353
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,420
 This means that we as his believers get to live in this reality, right?

354
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,020
 We're actively waiting for Jesus' return by living this gospel-driven life that we're

355
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,300
 talking about.

356
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,380
 And though this is why we can be bold and courageous when we share the gospel.

357
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,020
 This is why you see some people go as far as to risking their lives, going to the most

358
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,460
 dangerous of places to live amongst the most difficult of situations to tell people about

359
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:12,100
 Jesus because they know that even if they lose their life in this, resurrection awaits.

360
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,620
 The theologian N.T.

361
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,340
 Wright says it this way.

362
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,660
 The good news, no, the great news of Jesus is that with his resurrection, it becomes

363
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,820
 clear not only that he is Messiah and Lord, but that in his death, he has dealt with evil

364
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:34,580
 itself, a blow from which though still retains some power, it will never recover.

365
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,140
 This is the message of hope the world needs to hear.

366
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:45,260
 The resurrection means that we can live and love sacrificially even to the point of death

367
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,740
 because death is not the end.

368
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,140
 Imagine then, what would it be like if we really lived a life that believed in this

369
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,660
 truth?

370
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,660
 If everyone was willing to live their lives this way?

371
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,780
 Well, we can and that's what we're supposed to do.

372
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,540
 And when we share the gospel, we have to offer people an invitation into this lifestyle as

373
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
 well.

374
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,660
 So this is step three.

375
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:19,220
 We offer people an invitation to live their lives in this power of hope and resurrection.

376
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,420
 As Peter comes to the end of this, end of his speech, this is the last crucial step

377
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,420
 he takes.

378
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,860
 You see, the point of him preaching this message wasn't just to tell an amazing story.

379
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,060
 Rather, it's to help the people realize this is something, if you don't know about it,

380
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,940
 if you haven't heard about it, you need to respond to this.

381
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,620
 The Bible is not just a story of ancient texts from thousands of years ago, but the Word

382
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:53,580
 of God is described as active, like a double-edged sword, profitable for teaching, training,

383
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,060
 and righteousness.

384
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,860
 And this is exactly what we see happening as Peter proclaims the gospel.

385
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,660
 Look at the powerful response it elicits from the people hearing it.

386
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:10,780
 Verse 37, "When people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the

387
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,640
 other apostles, 'Brothers, what shall we do?'

388
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,980
 Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for

389
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:27,420
 the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

390
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:33,860
 This promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, for all whom

391
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,020
 call the Lord, sorry, excuse me, for all whom the Lord our God will call.'

392
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,980
 And with many other words he warned them and pleaded with them, 'Save yourselves from this

393
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,020
 corrupt generation.'

394
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,220
 Those who accepted this message were baptized and about 3,000 were added to the number that

395
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,860
 day."

396
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,060
 So maybe I'll put it this way.

397
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:02,180
 Have you ever felt the feeling, you know, suddenly you've realized, "Oh man, I've made

398
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,780
 a huge mistake."

399
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,520
 I get this sometimes.

400
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,220
 Maybe it's the time your wife told you, "Hey, can you remember to take the meat out the

401
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,780
 freezer please before you leave today?"

402
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,500
 And you're like, "Okay, okay."

403
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,940
 And you ignore it and you forget about it.

404
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,420
 And you didn't do it because you're watching TV and then suddenly it's 5 p.m. and then

405
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,320
 your wife calls you and say, "Hey, you took the meat out the freezer this morning, right?"

406
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,820
 And you just have this big question mark in your head.

407
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
 Oh.

408
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,620
 Remember, the Israelites have been waiting for this Messiah.

409
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,060
 Since the glorious days of King David, they've been waiting for a new king to lead them in

410
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,100
 victory over their enemies.

411
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,780
 And God sent Jesus as this Messiah.

412
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,940
 He came, He lived amongst them, He showed them love, He did miracles, but they did not

413
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,740
 recognize Him.

414
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,700
 And so they killed Him.

415
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,300
 Suddenly in this moment, these people have realized their error.

416
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,320
 They've realized their sin.

417
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,240
 So now they're asking, "What can we do?"

418
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,420
 And after hearing this message, people were distraught.

419
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,980
 The reaction is, "What shall we do?

420
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,700
 Is there any hope?"

421
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,540
 Notice here that there's a deep, genuine recognition of the sorrow over their sin.

422
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,960
 It says here that they were cut to the heart.

423
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,100
 This is an important part of our journey in sharing the gospel and sharing the gospel

424
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,020
 with someone else too.

425
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,780
 A true recognition of sin is needed.

426
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:37,740
 Otherwise, people will never truly recognize their real need for Jesus.

427
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,520
 This is one of those painful yet beautiful moments in life.

428
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,240
 This is one of those moments where you realize that your sin, where you realize your sin

429
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:56,180
 and that unless Jesus comes to rescue you, you're headed for disaster.

430
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,060
 What I'm trying to say is this.

431
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,180
 The gospel demands a response.

432
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,660
 So as we share the gospel, as we love people, as we stand by those who are hurting, we have

433
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,700
 to be ready for a shift to happen in these people's lives.

434
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,020
 Be ready for the gospel to make an impact on them.

435
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,540
 Now this isn't to say this is going to happen every time.

436
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,680
 We also have to be careful not to coerce people into responding in ways that are not genuine

437
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,240
 to them.

438
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,800
 Peter doesn't try to manipulate the situation anyway.

439
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,140
 He simply presents the truth.

440
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:33,680
 He presents the facts as they are and he lets the power of God's Word and the Holy Spirit

441
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:38,200
 do the work in the lives of those who are hearing it.

442
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,160
 But when it does happen, we need to be ready.

443
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,860
 And we need to be ready to receive people when they choose to take this next step.

444
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:53,300
 And this is when we offer the invitation to them to declare who Jesus is in their lives.

445
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,780
 So Peter ends with an invitation.

446
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,280
 He tells them to repent.

447
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:04,060
 He tells them to be baptized, know Jesus, embrace forgiveness, receive the Holy Spirit

448
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,900
 and join with us in new community.

449
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
 Repent.

450
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,700
 You know, when Peter points out the sin in people's lives, it's not just to make them

451
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,820
 feel bad about themselves and to wallow in their sorrow.

452
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,900
 His point is not to judge them and condemn them.

453
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,820
 He tells people to repent because repentance is the first step in our journey towards Jesus.

454
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,820
 Repentance is more than just feeling sorry for ourselves.

455
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,100
 The word itself means to turn back, right?

456
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,940
 And when we turn back to our sins, it implies that we have a change of heart.

457
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,480
 We confess the things that we have done wrong.

458
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,300
 This is one of the most beautiful things as we start to share the gospel is how it really

459
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,500
 makes life-changing things happen in people's lives.

460
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,920
 I've seen the powerful effects in my own life itself.

461
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,580
 When I've come to the places in seasons when I was wrestling with sin, trying to hide it

462
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:09,660
 in my life and finally coming to a place where I could truly confess and repent, if I'd held

463
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,920
 it in, I knew it would have been more devastating for me.

464
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,060
 But this is the power of repentance, that people who are heading into a life of destruction

465
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:26,940
 of sin, realizing what they've done wrong and the Holy Spirit turning their lives around

466
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,080
 to enable them to live in lives of freedom.

467
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,680
 So we repent.

468
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:38,440
 But Peter also calls for the believers here to be baptized.

469
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,640
 Baptism then becomes this public declaration of the faith that you've now chosen to walk

470
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
 in.

471
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,860
 This is a sign that you've declared that I'm going to be rescued by Jesus.

472
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,520
 It's a sign that you're following a new leader now.

473
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:57,640
 You have a new king, a new Lord in your life, and you're not ashamed to tell the world who

474
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,180
 he is.

475
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,400
 And so often at the Vine, we have baptisms coming up very soon.

476
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,600
 If this is something God's been speaking to you about, then I encourage you to take that

477
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,560
 step of boldness, to be baptized.

478
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,240
 In baptism, what we symbolize is us dying to our old lives.

479
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,880
 Our sins are washed away, and we are raised to walking into a new life with Jesus as our

480
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,900
 Lord and Savior.

481
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:33,240
 But then Peter also says this, "Receive the Holy Spirit."

482
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,380
 So after we repent, we're baptized, something even more amazing happens.

483
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,560
 You see, after we've repented, after we've received forgiveness, even after you've been

484
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,020
 baptized, the struggle with sin is still very real.

485
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,320
 It doesn't mean that you're going to live an easy, sin-free life.

486
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,840
 It doesn't mean you're still not going to wrestle with sin and temptation.

487
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:02,300
 The devil is still going to try and move you away from God.

488
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,520
 But this is where the Holy Spirit comes in.

489
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:12,620
 Jesus promises the Holy Spirit as our helper to lead us and to guide us as we continue

490
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,880
 our journey in this world.

491
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,800
 The Holy Spirit empowers us, enables us to do amazing and wonderful things, to live for

492
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:25,880
 God's name, to continue to represent Him in everything that we do.

493
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,160
 The Holy Spirit encourages us to stay on the path toward Jesus until the day He returns.

494
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,720
 So you don't do this journey alone.

495
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,560
 The Holy Spirit is with you.

496
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:46,880
 And in the end, 3,000 people, it says, come forward to repent, to be baptized, and to

497
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,840
 give their lives to Jesus.

498
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,200
 And this is how the early church is birthed.

499
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,840
 And it goes on in this chapter, it tells us that this community begins to grow.

500
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,800
 And not only does it begin to grow in number, it begins to grow in the way they care and

501
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,600
 love each other.

502
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
 They share everything.

503
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,500
 They bring everything to the table and they look after each other in this radical, life-changing

504
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,480
 way, counter-cultural way.

505
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,880
 This was the church that Jesus was trying to build.

506
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:20,400
 And this is the church that God continues to want to build here on this earth.

507
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,880
 This is the kind of church that Jesus wants to see us continue today.

508
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,480
 And this is why we have to continue to be willing to spread the gospel, to invite people

509
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,720
 into this sort of community.

510
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,480
 So as you share the gospel, of course, maybe not 3,000 people are going to give their lives

511
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,040
 to Jesus each time.

512
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,800
 But what we're encouraged to do is to do our part.

513
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,740
 It might be one person.

514
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,440
 Maybe it will be 3,000 people.

515
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,940
 Maybe it might be 30,000 people even.

516
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,580
 But as Christians, we have been called just to be faithful and keep on adding to this

517
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,100
 number.

518
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:06,000
 This is why church, what we're doing, the story of Acts is still an unfinished story.

519
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,040
 Our call therefore is not to give up in spreading the gospel.

520
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:16,160
 No matter where you are, no matter who you are, we continue to do this.

521
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,380
 And we witness the expansion of God's kingdom as many more come to know Him.

522
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:29,660
 So this is my prayer for us as a church, as a community, that we'll be passionate about

523
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,220
 declaring His Word, that we would live the kind of life that Jesus lived, showing hope

524
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,900
 and compassion and love to those around us.

525
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,640
 And as we do this, we see lives change.

526
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,220
 We see people receive hope in the most hopeless of situations.

527
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:57,480
 We see people embrace joy and understand the identity in life that God has given to them.

528
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,980
 And we continue to do this until the day Jesus returns.

529
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:10,060
 May this be what we're known for as we continue to heed God's call to spread the gospel in

530
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,580
 this city and around the world.

531
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:19,020
 Would you pray with me, church?

532
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,720
 Father, we thank you for your story.

533
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,420
 We thank you for your life.

534
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:37,060
 We thank you that you came to dwell with us as unworthy as it was, as unworthy as we are

535
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,900
 for you to have lived among us, Lord.

536
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:49,420
 You came, you showed us what a full, obedient life in God looks like.

537
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,540
 And so, Jesus, as we continue to live out our lives here, in the different places you've

538
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:01,300
 put us in, in the families that we have, in our schools, in our workplaces, and with the

539
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,740
 gifts and talents you've given to us, Lord, we know that these things are not just for

540
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,740
 ourselves.

541
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:12,220
 But Lord, you want to use us, you want to work through us, you want to partner with

542
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,840
 us in letting people know who you are.

543
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:23,700
 There is a world out there that continues to be lost in hopelessness, in darkness, in

544
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,380
 thinking that there's no future for them, in thinking that this is it.

545
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:38,420
 Lord, with the gospel that you've given to us, may we speak it out boldly, but we may

546
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,180
 also live it out bravely.

547
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,620
 And as we do this, church, as we do this, I pray that we would become a community that

548
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,940
 truly embraces those who are lost.

549
00:37:51,940 --> 00:38:00,460
 I pray that many more lives would be changed because of the hope that they found in Jesus.

550
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,100
 Use us for your purposes, Lord.

551
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,220
 And Holy Spirit, I pray that you would give us wisdom and strength to do this by your

552
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,220
 power.

553
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,620
 It's in your beautiful name we pray.

554
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,380
 Amen.

555
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
