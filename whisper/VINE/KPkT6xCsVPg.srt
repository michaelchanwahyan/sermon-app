1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Amen.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Yeah.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Thank you, guys.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 I feel like...

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hi.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:19,620
 I feel like I've preached enough now to not make the common mistake of saying, "Good morning,"

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,620
 when it's 2 PM.

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,620
 So good afternoon, everyone.

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,620
 How are you guys doing?

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,620
 All right.

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,480
 I did this at 9.15, but I feel like I'm gonna do it for you guys, too, so you understand

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,480
 what it means.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,760
 I'm gonna say, "Good afternoon, fam."

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,720
 That's how black people say, "Good afternoon."

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,720
 That's our way of doing it.

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
 So now you know.

18
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,040
 I just taught you something nice and cultural.

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,800
 Today we're gonna spend some time, speaking of culture, furthering what Pastor Ellison

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,400
 talked about last week, looking at diversity, at ethnic groups, at just what God was doing

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,480
 in all of this bringing together concept.

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,080
 Today's gonna be meaty.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,920
 It's a massive passage, but I'm gonna break it down and show it's exactly our focus point

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
 and what it's gonna look like.

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,720
 So please do not be overwhelmed when you see 13 verses appear.

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,360
 I'm gonna read all of them so we get context and understand what's happening, but we will

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
 break it down and we'll have bite-sized chunks.

28
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,040
 So let me start by looking here at Ephesians 3, verses 1 through 13.

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,440
 I'm gonna read it aloud for us all.

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,880
 It says this, "For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for the sake of

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,240
 you Gentiles, surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,400
 given to me for you, that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,420
 already written briefly.

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,440
 In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 Christ, which was not made known to people in other generations as it has been revealed

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,840
 by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,960
 This mystery is that through the gospel, the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,080
 together of one body, and sharers together of the promise in Christ Jesus.

39
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,440
 And I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given through the working

40
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
 of His power.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,560
 And although I am less than the least of the Lord's people, this grace was given to me

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,680
 to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ and to make plain to everyone the

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,520
 administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God who created

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 all things."

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,320
 Now, verse 10 is gonna be our anchor verse, our focal point, so definitely dial in for

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
 this.

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,840
 It says this, "His intent was that now through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,020
 be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms according to His eternal

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,520
 purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,400
 And in Him, through faith in Him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence.

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,040
 I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my suffering for you, which are

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 your glory."

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,200
 So, God, we come before you and we open your word.

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,640
 And Holy Spirit, we just ask that they just won't be preaching or reading.

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,040
 God, we know that your word is living and active, and we just ask that you would soften

56
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,840
 our hearts to be able to hear what it is that you have to say, what it is that your word

57
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,520
 spells out for us, that it will inspire, that it will give us the courage to be the people

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
 that you've called us to be.

59
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,320
 So, yeah, we give you this time.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,280
 We ask you to help minimize any distractions in our minds or in our hearts and allow us

61
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
 to have a focus.

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
 So, in the name we pray, amen.

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,200
 Now, like I said, these 13 verses, that's a long bit.

64
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
 I'm pretty sure you don't remember what the first verse was.

65
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,720
 So, let me summarize what all of this says so we know where we're going.

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 All right.

67
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,040
 So, if you were to take this whole concept and boil it down into one phrase or one sentence,

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,480
 it'd be this, that the mystery of the reconciliation of all humanity to God and to one another,

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,200
 when it's displayed and illuminated through the church, it will powerfully reveal God's

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,880
 manifold wisdom to the rulers of the world.

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
 All right.

72
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,040
 So, last week, if you were here, Pastor Ellison led us through chapter two of Ephesians, which

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,400
 has a lot to do with people and with them coming together, ends up being the building

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,120
 block to the concept of reconciliation.

75
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,560
 When I say reconciliation, just so we're all on the same page, to reconcile is to take

76
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,800
 two things that were against each other that are broken apart and to bring them together,

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,200
 not just at peace, but unified working together for a joint purpose.

78
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 All right.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,560
 So, they are together, not just next to each other.

80
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
 And actually, I heard quite a few comments.

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,800
 I'm going to disclose some information.

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,000
 I'm one of the people who's behind our social media.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,280
 So, I get to see all of your reposts every week and the things that you guys find awesome

84
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
 and interesting.

85
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,480
 And a lot of you had a lot to say about what Pastor Ellison shared last week.

86
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,880
 There was a lot of positive comments of how, man, that was a timely message.

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
 Oh, my goodness.

88
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
 That's what I needed to hear.

89
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,840
 And I'm glad that we were able to experience that because to really understand Ephesians

90
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,600
 2 is to challenge the potential prejudices that we might hold in our hearts unseen and

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,080
 how Christ has made a way so that there is no outsider.

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,800
 And in that reality, we as a church must also commit to welcoming anyone that comes through

93
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,200
 our doors no matter where they come from.

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,560
 We as a family of God cannot reserve our hospitality and our acceptance and our kindness just for

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
 people who are like us or like-minded to us.

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,680
 But if the gospel is true, then we have to open up our arms and challenge our prejudices,

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
 right?

98
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
 Really figure out what it means.

99
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,640
 This is Ephesians 2, and I know I'm repeating, but it's what the first 10 verses of Ephesians

100
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,360
 3 actually are talking about as well.

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,320
 This concept of God bringing together this new humanity now with the same promises that

102
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,040
 he had for Israel will now be what he's given to the Jews and the Gentiles.

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,920
 Paul is both highlighting and clarifying a mystery to the church, showing that this

104
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
 is actually the reason he's in prison.

105
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,000
 So he ends up getting in prison.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,320
 You can read this in Acts, but he ends up in trouble because he as a Jewish man is teaching

107
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,280
 the gospel of Christ to non-Jewish people, and it is driving everyone crazy.

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,160
 And so he ends up in prison for this.

109
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,240
 So he is saying, "This is the reason I'm here, my mission to evangelize, to share the good

110
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,200
 news of Jesus, not just to the Jews, but also to the Gentiles."

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,800
 So all of this will impact the way that Paul expects us as the church to live, how we treat

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
 one another with dignity and with respect.

113
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,280
 So because of Christ, we now find peace with one another and we find unity with one another.

114
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,040
 And this would have been pretty groundbreaking.

115
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,800
 So the way that the Jews and the Gentiles lived is that they just did not mix.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,000
 They did not go together.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,160
 They were separate people.

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,040
 They had different backgrounds, they had different practices, and they did not come together.

119
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,480
 And so when the audience of Ephesians would have been reading or listening to this letter

120
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,800
 read aloud to them, this would have been groundbreaking information.

121
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,920
 This would be, "Whoa, that's not normally how we operate."

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,880
 It would have been a shock to them naturally.

123
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
 And what Paul is going to do is he's going to take that shock that you see in chapter

124
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,760
 two and the first 10 verses of chapter three, and he's going to expound on it more, explaining

125
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,160
 not just what we ought to do, but he's going to give us some theology around it.

126
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,520
 He's going to trace some things back, and I'm going to hopefully be able to show you

127
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,920
 where these origins of these ideas come from.

128
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,720
 So starting at verse 10 again, we see that Paul properly outlines and brings us this

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,600
 description of the church.

130
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,720
 He introduces it to us here.

131
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,680
 He defines the purpose of the church and why it exists.

132
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,640
 Ephesians 3.10, "His intent was that now through the church, a manifold wisdom of God should

133
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,040
 be made known."

134
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,600
 So observe and notice what Paul does here.

135
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,880
 See if you can catch onto the components of what church is based off of what he says.

136
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,520
 Because I think if we are honest with ourselves, potentially we tend to harbor these beliefs

137
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,400
 that actually don't line up cohesive with what Paul is saying.

138
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,200
 When Paul speaks of church here, he doesn't speak of a Sunday.

139
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,660
 He doesn't speak of a temple.

140
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,360
 He doesn't speak of a service.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 There's no preacher mentioned here.

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,000
 There's no worship team mentioned here.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,920
 No, when Paul speaks of church, he speaks of people.

144
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,960
 He speaks of a people, a group of people.

145
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,920
 But Paul uses the word ecclesia, which is the Greek word he used to describe a gathering

146
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 or an assembly.

147
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,000
 But more specifically in this case, when it refers to the church, the word has a connotation

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,400
 of a called out assembly, assembled for a purpose.

149
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,520
 I was walking here this morning at like seven something.

150
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,000
 I'm like, "It's such a cheesy thing.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,200
 I never want to be a cheesy pastor."

152
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,960
 But I thought of like Avengers assemble, right?

153
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,480
 Like in my mind, like the church is like this gathering assembled, unified for a purpose.

154
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
 So stay with me.

155
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,800
 This whole idea of unity and peace gathered together, it all is meant to lead to this

156
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,920
 expression called the church.

157
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,080
 This called out assembly.

158
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,700
 This group of people with diverse backgrounds and cultures together and unified, called

159
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
 out under the banner of Jesus.

160
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,520
 See all this time, this is what's tricky to the Jews here, all this time, God's plan was

161
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
 bigger than they had realized.

162
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
 So we start with Abraham.

163
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,720
 God introduces himself in the Old Testament to Abraham and ultimately introduces himself

164
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,760
 to the world through Abraham.

165
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,080
 And through Abraham, we get the nation of Israel who are now the people of God who are

166
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,120
 living under his covenant and following his rule and his reign.

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,280
 And God sets them apart, redeems them, sends Jesus to reconcile them into relationship

168
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,280
 with him again, salvation through grace by faith, all those things that we know.

169
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,080
 But then we realize here that actually God's plan was never just for Israel.

170
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
 It was a bit bigger than the people would have understood.

171
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,080
 And that's why it would have been a shock to them.

172
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
 It would have been encouraging them into a different way of seeing things.

173
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,200
 If we look back more closely at Abraham's covenant, we would see that God makes these

174
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,560
 bold statements that he would, you know, bless those who blessed Abraham and curse those

175
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,960
 who cursed Abraham, and he would make him fruitful in the land and would multiply this

176
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,200
 and would just bless his whole existence.

177
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:00,880
 But the last bit of that promise, what he tells to Abraham is this, that through you,

178
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
 I will bless all the nations.

179
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,720
 Now not through you, I will bless your lineage only and your people.

180
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,960
 Through you, I will bless the whole nation.

181
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,360
 This is the meta-narrative of Scripture, that God is not just for one people group.

182
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,040
 This has been the plan all along.

183
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,680
 When Paul says it here, he would say it in verse 11, and he would phrase it like this,

184
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,960
 this was all according to the eternal purpose.

185
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,520
 This was something that God had in mind from the beginning, the reconciliation of all people.

186
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,620
 God may have introduced himself through the people of Israel, but he had no intention

187
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,040
 on remaining a mono-ethnic God.

188
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,400
 The most famous Bible verse in all of Scripture, John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world, humanity,

189
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,720
 people, all of us, he so loved all of us that he would send his Son."

190
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,240
 The epistles would have it where Paul or Peter would say that Christ would desire that all

191
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,080
 would be saved, not just some, not just one special group of people, Christ for all people.

192
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:10,240
 And that ends up being this whole mystery that Paul illuminates in verses 6 through

193
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
 10, that before it was hard for people to see, but the whole purpose at the end of the

194
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,560
 day was never just God for the Jewish people.

195
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,800
 It was God for the world.

196
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,560
 That is what he was trying to get them to see, and that's what he was making clear at

197
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
 this moment.

198
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,040
 So I feel like for the first century readers, when they were to hear this letter read out

199
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,760
 loud to them, their first questions are like, first of all, they're like, "What?"

200
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,720
 But then secondly, they're like, "How?

201
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,800
 How do you bring together all these people and all together under one rule and all together

202
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 as God's people?

203
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,240
 What does that even look like?

204
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
 Do we convert to their practices or do we just convert them to our practices?"

205
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,240
 Ellison said circumcised like 50 times in two minutes last week, the idea of making

206
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,000
 people more like the Jews, but that's actually not what God's heart is, right?

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,520
 He says, "No circumcised or circumcised, it doesn't matter."

208
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,480
 He's not about changing Gentiles into Jewish people, nor is he about demonizing the Jewish

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,320
 customs and making them Gentile.

210
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:15,120
 No, he's looking for and creating a new humanity, a new gathered community reconciled together

211
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,320
 that is called the church.

212
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
 That is what we are.

213
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,160
 And this speaks to the significance of the church.

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,200
 This gives value and tells us that the church matters and that the church is important.

215
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,120
 And if the church is important, we've got to really understand the details of what makes

216
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,520
 the church the church, right?

217
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,640
 We've got to understand exactly what is a church because coming on a Sunday, 9, 15,

218
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,600
 11, or 2 o'clock, and listening to someone preach does not qualify as church.

219
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,040
 Coming and listening to great worship, maybe even raising your hand, you kind of can't

220
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,480
 come to church.

221
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,080
 That's not the vision of what church is in this bit, and we have to understand what church

222
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,680
 means, what God desires a church to be if we're going to be a church of impact.

223
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,080
 It actually makes a difference in our city.

224
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,360
 So let me explain it this way.

225
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,240
 The church initiates or is initiated by God.

226
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
 It is His idea.

227
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,600
 I think beautifully phrased, we could say that the church is a community made up of

228
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,800
 different nations and backgrounds and tribes and tongues and different experiences, all

229
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,560
 redeemed by the blood of Jesus and right standing with Him, reconciled to God.

230
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
 That sounds good?

231
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
 That's okay?

232
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,240
 Everyone okay with that?

233
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,800
 That's nice, but that's incomplete.

234
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,480
 It sounds good, but it's actually more to the picture.

235
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,280
 The life, death, and resurrection of Jesus was not only to provide us reconciliation

236
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
 to God.

237
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
 Do we know that?

238
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,840
 Like it's not just about making sure that us and God are in right standing relationship.

239
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,680
 If we trace the biblical narrative further back to Genesis 3, we would see that before

240
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,000
 the fall and after the fall, a couple of things change.

241
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,360
 There's a couple of broken fractures that are introduced by sin.

242
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,200
 The first one is pretty obvious, right?

243
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,680
 When Adam and Eve sin, God shows up to, "Oh, hey buddy.

244
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,080
 Guys, this is my son.

245
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
 Isn't he the best?"

246
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
 It's never happened before.

247
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
 Okay.

248
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 Back to my question.

249
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
 It's never happened before.

250
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
 Okay.

251
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
 Back to what I'm saying.

252
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,160
 In Genesis 3, when Adam sins, the first thing that changes about his relationship with God

253
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
 is this.

254
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,440
 God comes looking for Adam.

255
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,920
 And rather than walking in the cool of the evening like Adam used to do with God, what

256
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
 happens?

257
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,000
 Adam is hiding from God.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,560
 Adam doesn't want to be seen.

259
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
 There is a distance.

260
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,840
 There is a disconnect.

261
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
 There is a gap.

262
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,960
 There is a fragmented relationship, right?

263
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,360
 So that's the obvious one.

264
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,160
 And so Jesus comes and dies, redeems us back to right standing with God.

265
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,640
 But there's something else that happens in that Genesis story that we have to think about.

266
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,440
 When God approaches them about their sin, Adam responds in a very rude way.

267
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,720
 He says, "The woman that you gave me, the woman that you..."

268
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,040
 Him and Eve would have been one beforehand, right?

269
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,160
 We get the whole biblical picture of marriage from pre-fall.

270
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,240
 They were unified together, one flesh, one body.

271
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,520
 And after sin, he distances himself.

272
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,040
 Humanity ends up in this broken relationship at enmity with one another.

273
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,920
 We can go really, really, really deep on this, but I'm going to move forward.

274
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,040
 Sin did leave humanity at war with one another, right?

275
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,080
 It left us looking for peace and longing for reconciliation and not finding it.

276
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,920
 I mean, the next generation of Adam's family, what happens to the two brothers?

277
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
 One murders the other.

278
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,400
 Is there any more clear picture of a broken humanity in the relationship with one another?

279
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,880
 The mystery, however, of the gospel is that, yes, Jesus came and he died and he was risen

280
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:01,720
 again to life so that we could be redeemed with him, but he also was risen back to life

281
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,920
 so that humanity could be redeemed again with humanity.

282
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,240
 God doesn't just care about our vertical reconciliation and righteousness with him.

283
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,920
 It matters that we are reconciled to each other.

284
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,280
 And humanity reconciled to God and to one another is primarily meant to be expressed

285
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,720
 through the church.

286
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
 That's why we exist.

287
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,400
 The church is meant to be evidence to the world of that reconciliation, both of us to

288
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,760
 God and to us and each other.

289
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,280
 It's meant to be seen.

290
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,200
 The church exists to be this living example in all of its flaws and struggles and imperfections,

291
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,320
 yet filled with hope and grace of the reconciliation that's happened for humanity with God and

292
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,360
 with itself.

293
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,580
 This is who Christ's church is.

294
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,560
 This is his bride, this counter-cultural wild picture that ends up being a spark of life

295
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
 but speaks a meaningful purpose to who we are.

296
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
 And it's for that reason that we can't just come to church.

297
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,040
 It doesn't really work.

298
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,080
 You can't just check it off a list of something you did this week and feel good about your

299
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
 spirituality.

300
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,520
 Church is not a place or a location or a building.

301
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
 Church is a people.

302
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,280
 It's the unified people, God bringing together people of these different backgrounds under

303
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,920
 the banner of who Jesus Christ is, reconciled with God, living out that reconciliation with

304
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
 one another.

305
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,080
 This is the reason that we have the river model at the Vine.

306
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,980
 We say that church is not a building, therefore we're not going to put all of our efforts

307
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,440
 into making a really cool and awesome building.

308
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,200
 Instead, the church is wherever the people go out into the city, carrying the presence

309
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,480
 of God, carrying his goodness, and filling a dry and thirsty land with the water of life.

310
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,160
 What you do as the church brings life to where you go.

311
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,000
 That's why you'll hear it said by almost every service leader, by almost every pastor, especially

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,440
 Pastor Andrew, that church is more than a 90 minutes on a Sunday.

313
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,200
 Because we exist for such a more grand purpose.

314
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,520
 It's people living under this lordship of Jesus, bringing evidence to the world of the

315
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,440
 new humanity that God has created.

316
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,480
 Now look, in order to do this, what it means is we have to live in community.

317
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,880
 It means that we have to be doing something together outside of Sunday, specifically your

318
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
 Monday to Saturday.

319
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,120
 Because we can all gather once a week, that's not that challenging to do.

320
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,160
 But man, to live this out means that Monday through Saturday, the church has to be made

321
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,040
 manifest in showing God outside of here.

322
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,920
 Because we have to do the things that community does, that a new reconciled community does.

323
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,920
 Things like praying for one another, things like supporting one another, hearing what's

324
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,000
 going on, sitting and bearing one another's burdens, forgiving each other, walking out

325
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,040
 all these fruits of what the church is meant to be.

326
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,560
 And the reality is that you kind of can't do that on a Sunday just in an auditorium

327
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,320
 listening to me speak.

328
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,600
 You kind of can't bear Taz's burden while I'm talking to you, could you?

329
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,760
 That's a bit challenging.

330
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,040
 But outside of a Sunday, you could.

331
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,320
 So I think this calls us and encourages us to live as a church, yes, gathered on a Sunday,

332
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,340
 but also in community and out in our city throughout the rest of the week.

333
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,080
 This is how God designed the church to be.

334
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,040
 Not a service, not a place that you come to, but a people being evidence to the world,

335
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:35,280
 a living example just by the mere fact that we can be so different and not let that tear

336
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,800
 us apart.

337
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,040
 Just by the fact that we can come from different cultures, have different value systems, have

338
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,120
 different hierarchy of what we consider the most valuable thing, maybe even have different

339
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,600
 political ideologies and not let that splinter us.

340
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
 Right?

341
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,560
 Have you ever stopped and think about how crazy it is that God would do this, that he

342
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,400
 would want to bring these people together?

343
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,200
 That's not natural.

344
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,040
 That doesn't happen, especially in today's society where culture gives us this hyper

345
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,960
 focus on, you know, separating people, perpetuating and creating separate and unique, distinct

346
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,080
 identities that separates me from you.

347
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,880
 Where I'm different than you because I'm not like you, so I'm this.

348
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,720
 Where it creates more barriers and it does solutions.

349
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,480
 It creates more individual groups of people than a unified groups of people together.

350
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:31,040
 It ends up being not united or unifying, but rather ends up being society siloed.

351
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,240
 When our reactive ideologies, the only way they unify us is when we unify against someone

352
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,800
 else, right?

353
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,440
 We draw our line in the stand, I'm on this side of the camp, I believe this, so I'm against

354
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,720
 that.

355
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,920
 That's the narrative of society.

356
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,800
 I think if you're a little older, for all of our older generations here, I think you'd

357
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,400
 have heard the phrase, "Birds of a feather flock together," right?

358
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,200
 It's all about finding the people that are like you and having your own special thing

359
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,760
 that's not like them because you think this way and you believe this way.

360
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,720
 That's not...that's natural.

361
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,480
 That's how our society functions and operates.

362
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,840
 There's no middle ground.

363
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,320
 It splinters humanity and it divides humanity.

364
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,240
 The world and all of its wisdom doesn't actually pull you together.

365
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,360
 It gives you more reasons to be apart.

366
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,360
 And I feel like this experiment that God has can't work.

367
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,000
 It's not supposed to work.

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,720
 You know, it's the me first mentality of me and my clan, me and my people.

369
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,160
 How do you do that and be reconciled and unified with other people and care about their needs

370
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
 equally?

371
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,480
 It feels impossible, so impossible that it feels like some weird hippie euphoria dream.

372
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,600
 But the reality is that that's precisely what Christ is looking for.

373
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 So we have pushed it because it seems so unachievable because our culture is so loud and it's splintering

374
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,120
 that unity and being unified is something that's unachievable.

375
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,880
 But Christ is setting up his church as designed it to be that, what we would call an alternative

376
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,960
 society, a new humanity.

377
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,360
 A people where there is no special privilege because of your education or because of your

378
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,840
 employment status or because of the amount of zeros in your bank account, where there's

379
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,240
 no disadvantage because of where you came from or how you got to Hong Kong.

380
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,080
 A group of people where there's this general sense of equality and equity amongst us.

381
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,120
 And I think when the church lives out this way of seeing everyone in that imago dei lens,

382
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,200
 the image of God in every single person, it ends up becoming the birthplace, the breeding

383
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,680
 place for fairness, for liberty, for justice, where the poor are treated with the same respect

384
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,920
 that the rich are treated with, where there's shared fellowship and where we care for our

385
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,040
 neighbors, where the alien is not taken advantage of but there's a voice for them, where the

386
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,520
 widows and the orphans are protected, where the vulnerable are spoken up for.

387
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,740
 See, when the church lives this way, it displays the wisdom of God.

388
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:03,280
 It displays the way of God.

389
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,380
 It shows something on full display.

390
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,760
 It shows his kingdom, which we would pray in Matthew, "Your kingdom come, your will

391
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
 be done."

392
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,400
 When the church lives as this reconciled humanity, you don't have to pray it, we live it.

393
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,880
 We get to be his kingdom come here.

394
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,200
 Pastor Ellison said something last week that has been sitting in my head, living rent-free.

395
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,080
 He made the comment that the church is not meant to reflect culture.

396
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,160
 I feel like I 100% agree.

397
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,380
 I think we can all agree with that.

398
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,540
 But I think when I thought about it a bit, I felt like so often the church kind of looks

399
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,360
 just like the world.

400
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,120
 It doesn't look that different.

401
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,680
 Well, because we sing?

402
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
 That's not...

403
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,240
 You can go to a concert and sing.

404
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,240
 Listen to someone talk?

405
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,120
 There's TED Talks all around the city.

406
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,480
 It doesn't look that different from what we see on the world.

407
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,680
 The church is not meant to reflect the culture and the present day values, but so often and

408
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,000
 so easily it does.

409
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 No, the church actually has a more grand and intentional purpose.

410
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,440
 The church is this, it's God's wisdom on display.

411
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:25,480
 We exist to display something, and that thing specifically is the wisdom of God.

412
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,680
 This idea of us being displayed and being visible is not introduced in Ephesians 3.

413
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:37,160
 It's something that if you paid attention to the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5 through

414
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,680
 7, Jesus talks about.

415
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,760
 He would say when speaking of his people that they...

416
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,000
 He goes, "You are a light on a hill to be seen."

417
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,080
 He would say that you don't light a lamp to hide it.

418
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,000
 So I grew up Baptist, kind of Baptist, first Pentecostal, then Baptist, very confusing.

419
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,440
 But in my latter times of being Baptist, we used to sing this song at Sunday school.

420
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,800
 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it...

421
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 Someone knows it.

422
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,520
 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.

423
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,880
 This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.

424
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,480
 Let it shine, let it shine.

425
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
 Did I just sing that?

426
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,880
 I always told myself I would not be that pastor.

427
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 Wow.

428
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,000
 I'm glad this is not the live stream.

429
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,120
 My dad would judge me.

430
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
 My dad's a pastor as well.

431
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,920
 Anyways, but you don't light a lamp and hide it.

432
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
 That's the whole point.

433
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,400
 You're supposed to be so different, so countercultural, this alternative society that you have to

434
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,160
 be seen because you look so different.

435
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,540
 You are light to the world.

436
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,740
 You are salt to the world.

437
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,680
 You are yeast and dough to be seen, to make a difference.

438
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,520
 When the church does this, it is seen and it's displayed.

439
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,040
 Here's a nice little plus.

440
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,660
 You don't have to be super evangelistic when the church does this because rather than going

441
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,160
 out and handing out a thousand tracts or trying to awkwardly say, "Do you know Jesus?"

442
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,500
 and make someone feel uncomfortable, actually, the church by doing this is attractive.

443
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,600
 Who does not want to be a part of a community where everyone is loved and taken care of,

444
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,840
 where everyone is valued, where because you have the image of God in you, I love and respect

445
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
 you fully.

446
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,920
 Nothing about your social status changes who you are because you are made in God's image.

447
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,600
 A community that is for one another, meeting needs, praying together, the Acts community

448
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,120
 of the church, we're sharing all things in common.

449
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,940
 This is so different than what we see, but this by nature, by being such a contrast,

450
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,040
 it attracts people.

451
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,080
 It's like a moth to a flame, which is good for the whole light analogy.

452
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,480
 I just came to me.

453
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
 Cool.

454
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,240
 I'm going to skip that next slide.

455
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,680
 I don't think we need to talk about it.

456
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,360
 The whole point of this is that we end up being a church where our vertical relationship

457
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,600
 and reconciliation with God extends into our horizontal reconciliation with one another.

458
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
 That is what we're saying.

459
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,280
 When we do that, when the church lives that way, it is God's wisdom on display.

460
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,400
 One of my favorite examples of this is found, again, this one is in Luke.

461
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
 Jesus is getting ready to teach and people are like, "Hey, some of the wisest people

462
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,480
 around, the teachers of the law, they come up to Jesus and they say, 'Yo, we have a question

463
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
 for you.'"

464
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
 They're doing this.

465
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,040
 It says in the scripture that they're doing this to try and trap him.

466
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,800
 They say, "Jesus, of all the 300 and however many commandments that there are, which one

467
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,520
 is the most important?"

468
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
 I love this.

469
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,360
 They ask Jesus a question where the answer should be singular, it should be one answer.

470
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,360
 Jesus in all of his awesomeness says, "I'm going to give you two answers."

471
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,160
 He goes, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength."

472
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,040
 Now this is something that every good Jewish person would have known, memorized, grown

473
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,840
 up, kind of living up.

474
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:57,040
 He says that and then he says, "And," which I'm sure their ears perked up, "And love your

475
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,160
 neighbor as yourself."

476
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,800
 And then he goes on to give this story of a Samaritan who were people that were different,

477
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,240
 slightly ethically different, mixed group of people.

478
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,920
 The Samaritans were different than the Jews.

479
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,880
 The Samaritans and the Jews hated one another.

480
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,200
 This example of loving God and loving others is an example of a Samaritan.

481
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,320
 This thing has just been sprinkled throughout, God reconciling all people together.

482
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,480
 See the church when it does this is on display.

483
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,040
 It's visible to the world.

484
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,720
 And I love that we as a church don't have to...we don't have to worry about being cool.

485
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,040
 We don't have to worry about, you know, having the latest this or the latest that or having,

486
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,840
 you know, cutting edge sermons or, I don't know, making a stand about this thing or just

487
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,200
 speaking because speaking is a thing.

488
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,520
 To be seen doesn't mean we have to put ourselves out there.

489
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,280
 I love this because Jesus would say in John 13, "For the world to know that you belong

490
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,020
 to me."

491
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
 What do you have to do?

492
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
 Do you have to make a lot of statements?

493
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,920
 Do you have to bash people in the head of the Bible?

494
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,520
 Do you have to be super religious?

495
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,440
 Do you have to pray nonstop?

496
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,480
 No, it's gonna love one another.

497
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,900
 By your love for one another, they will know that you belong to me.

498
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:18,080
 How easy yet profound just loving your neighbor is.

499
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
 That is the call.

500
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,880
 That is reconciliation of humanity.

501
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,640
 That's what God desires his church to be, a place where those who are reconciled with

502
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,860
 God now are reconciling with each other, coming together and being whole and being unified.

503
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,840
 This is what the church is meant to show.

504
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 However, Paul, like I love that I just spent like 20 minutes on that.

505
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,640
 Paul's actual point in here is not for the world to see us.

506
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
 Did anybody notice that?

507
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,000
 That kind of led us astray for a little bit.

508
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,240
 He's not just talking about obviously, yes, when we do this, the world does see us, right?

509
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,720
 But his point is not so that the world can see us.

510
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,280
 It's actually a bit different.

511
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,520
 He in verse 10, I'm gonna read it one more time, see if you catch on to it.

512
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,880
 His intent, meaning Jesus, was that now through the church, the manifold wisdom of God will

513
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,640
 be made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms.

514
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,240
 We're gonna talk about spiritual things, the things unseen, the spiritual realm.

515
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,520
 And isn't that a wild concept that God's way of speaking to the spiritual world is through

516
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,080
 his physical people being reconciled together.

517
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
 So it's not just...

518
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,960
 And let me put this in context because Paul is also gonna talk about, you know, wearing

519
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,560
 the armor of God and all these things that we ought to do.

520
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:42,240
 And before he says it in Ephesians 6, he would lay it up using similar language about how

521
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,040
 real the spiritual world is.

522
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,480
 And I'm just saying this because I think it's easy for us to live just based off of what

523
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
 we see, right?

524
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,800
 Like I see you, you see me, that's easy, cool.

525
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,840
 But angels and demons and other creations, and as Ellison would talk about Nephilim and

526
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,160
 this and that, like, what even is that?

527
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,560
 Is that even there?

528
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,760
 So Paul would, before he even gets into the armor of God, he would say this in chapter

529
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,360
 6, verse 12, "For our struggle, for the battle that we wage, is not against flesh and blood."

530
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,120
 It's not just a bit about what you see.

531
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,280
 It's not against people, but against rulers, similar word, rulers, against authorities,

532
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,360
 similar word, authorities, against the powers of this dark world, against the spiritual

533
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,080
 forces of evil in the heavenly realm.

534
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,920
 There is a spiritual world, there is a spiritual battle.

535
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,080
 It's not just what we see.

536
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,080
 And I think what's remarkable about this is that God is saying the church is important.

537
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,600
 It matters, but not just for the physical.

538
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:47,080
 The church matters because it displays God's wisdom to the spiritual world.

539
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,280
 It's not just about us being reconciled to each other so we can be kumbaya.

540
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,280
 We're making a statement to the spiritual world as well as the physical world.

541
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,560
 Satan and his demons are pushed back by the church living in reconciliation.

542
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
 Think about this.

543
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
 This just hit me now.

544
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,000
 Satan's whole plan to get back at God because he knew he could never defeat God was to go

545
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
 after his kids, was to go after his creation.

546
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,680
 And so he ruptures relationship between man and man and between man and God.

547
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,600
 And now God is taking the very thing that Satan thought he ruined and using it as a

548
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,760
 statement to say that God is victorious.

549
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,080
 To say that the cross was not a joke.

550
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:35,600
 The cross was not empty promises, but Jesus raised from the dead says something because

551
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,360
 look at the people that you brought sin into.

552
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,040
 Look at how they've been made alive.

553
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
 They were once enemies.

554
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,680
 They were once hostile to one another, but look at them now.

555
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:51,080
 Through Jesus in them, through a reconciled relationship with Jesus, they can now live

556
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,840
 reconciled to one another.

557
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,640
 Does that say that the church matters or what?

558
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,400
 It screams that we have something to do and we can't just have services once a week and

559
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,880
 think that is the church.

560
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,920
 We actually, oh, we lose the meaning of church if we think it's a place that we come to once

561
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,380
 a week, right?

562
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,760
 We lose the meaning of church if we think church is over once we exit the door during

563
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,280
 the response song.

564
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:26,860
 No, to be God's church is to live a certain way, to be an example outside of this building

565
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,120
 and inside of this building of yes, reconciliation between us and God, but also reconciliation

566
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,960
 between us and our neighbor.

567
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,400
 God created the church this way on purpose.

568
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:46,880
 This was his scheme for a reconciled universe, delivering a defeating blow to the enemy,

569
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,280
 displaying God as wise and as right, and his ways not only as higher than ours, but better.

570
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 So we, his church, are a physical statement to the spiritual realm that God is good and

571
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,320
 that he has redeemed man in his redeeming creation.

572
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,280
 So let me summarize all of that because I know 13 verses, a lot of mystery, a lot of

573
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,680
 spiritual world, a lot of reconciliation, Jews, Gentiles, not as many circumcisions,

574
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,440
 but it's a lot of things to kind of put in together.

575
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,920
 The reconciliation of humanity to God and to each other displayed and illuminated through

576
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:33,960
 the church, it reveals that God is wise, that the cross was victorious, not just to those

577
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,080
 outside of the church, but to the spiritual realm as well.

578
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,120
 That gives us the significance of what the church is.

579
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,040
 When we see that, we recognize that the church is not just a nice thing to have, it's deeply

580
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
 necessary.

581
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,960
 It exists to serve a significant physical and spiritual purpose.

582
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,120
 So us as a divine community, if we're to be this kind of people, it looks like loving

583
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,680
 each other on Mondays through Saturdays, not just coming on Sundays, right?

584
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,440
 If we're going to be that kind of community, it means getting involved in the justice work

585
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,800
 in our city because every single person is created in God's image, therefore they have

586
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,920
 inherent value, right?

587
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,320
 If we're going to be this kind of space, it means meeting together throughout the week

588
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
 in small groups, right?

589
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,440
 I've dedicated a small group and all of their kids this morning.

590
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,480
 They all live in the Typo area and they get together every other week.

591
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,320
 It could be as simple as that.

592
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,340
 It could be, you know, maybe you're a busy businessman or woman and you have very little

593
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,000
 time in your day and you're at work all the time.

594
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,760
 I'm pretty sure they give you a lunch break.

595
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,240
 So maybe during your lunch break, once a week, you can gather with some people in that space

596
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,920
 and just create a space for maybe prayer, for encouragement.

597
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,600
 What would it look like to, I don't know, not see everybody at your work as someone

598
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
 to defeat?

599
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,480
 What would it look like to live and to practice out biblical values within the way you run

600
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,760
 your business?

601
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,240
 To not put profit as number one or me and my gains as number one, but the way that I

602
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,960
 do my things, the way that I live my life, the way that I engage in business to be displaying

603
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,840
 God's wisdom by me being reconciled with those around me.

604
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,880
 Could it be that that's where God has called you in your sphere of influence?

605
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,360
 Could it just be that you get together and pray with people and pray for their needs?

606
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:37,060
 If all that's displayed is a good sermon or a really good worship team and nothing else

607
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,240
 happens throughout the week, we missed the point.

608
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,740
 That's what I'm going to hark on.

609
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,040
 If we listen to this and we're like, "Oh, that was a very moving sermon," and the next

610
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,800
 time we decide to be engaging in something spiritual is next Sunday, we've missed the

611
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
 point.

612
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,080
 We cannot allow church, we cannot boil down the meaning of church to just attending a

613
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,800
 gathering once a week.

614
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
 No, you were made for much more.

615
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,320
 The church exists for much more.

616
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,000
 God is wanting to utilize us and work with us in redeeming all of creation.

617
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,360
 How vast of a purpose is that?

618
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,820
 It matters that you go out into your spheres of influence and you do the things you do.

619
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,960
 It matters that you go and you be the church wherever that might be.

620
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,760
 Don't just come to church.

621
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,080
 Dare yourself to be the church wherever you are.

622
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,920
 So let me wrap up by boiling it down to maybe two ways that we can practically think about

623
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,400
 this and questions we can ask ourselves as we consider what it looks like to take this

624
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,600
 reconciliation between me and God and the reconciliation between me and my neighbor

625
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,240
 and display God's wisdom through that because that's a big, big task.

626
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,320
 Chapter two of Ephesians, chapter three of Ephesians, very similar.

627
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,960
 Unity or peace in chapter two and unity in chapter three.

628
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,720
 But all that requires us to ask ourselves this question, have we allowed the gospel

629
00:37:52,720 --> 00:38:02,360
 to change us so fully that we can love whoever walks through these doors and into our community?

630
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,960
 Have we?

631
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,240
 Can we see those around us through the lens of Christ?

632
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,520
 This will impact how we talk to our domestic helpers.

633
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,240
 This will impact how we treat the angry old lady who hits us with a cane on the train.

634
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,040
 This will impact everything, every relationship we come in contact with.

635
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,400
 If you see people as the image of God, as they are, this isn't like some fairy tale,

636
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,920
 God's image is in every single person.

637
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,560
 Could we see them that way?

638
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,880
 And if we did, would we then allow them to have the same value that we have, precious,

639
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,160
 deeply valuable to God?

640
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,960
 Have you allowed the gospel to so fully change you that you would allow anybody into this

641
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
 community?

642
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,000
 That's the first question.

643
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,880
 I think when you wrestle with that, like the tips that Pastor Allison gave us last week,

644
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,160
 ask yourself what are the barriers?

645
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,520
 What are the things that are stopping me from seeing people the way Christ sees them?

646
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,200
 Is it race?

647
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,720
 Is it age?

648
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,760
 Is it culture?

649
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,200
 Is it political ideology?

650
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,400
 Maybe the easiest one, right?

651
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,640
 Do they have a different view about politics?

652
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,960
 I don't know.

653
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,040
 All right.

654
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,520
 Ask yourself what those things are.

655
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,680
 Ask God to show you what those things are.

656
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,960
 And ask him to give you the strength to acknowledge them and to submit them to his will.

657
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,760
 And place those things so far second behind how primary you hold the unity that we have

658
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,440
 in Christ Jesus.

659
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
 Ask his spirit to do that.

660
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,680
 And what I think when you do, I think as he does that work and you're deepening that reconciliation

661
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,960
 in you and him, it will impact the way that you engage with your neighbor.

662
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,480
 And the second thing is this.

663
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,080
 You've heard me say the word river, river model, one of the things that we focus here

664
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
 at the Vine.

665
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,920
 My question is how can we be a river?

666
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,520
 The church as a living example throughout the city.

667
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,160
 Again, the church is not a building.

668
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,560
 It's not a place you come to.

669
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:04,240
 So if that's the case, do we dare to allow the unifying power of Christ to give us the

670
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,160
 courage to speak to those around us?

671
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,000
 Does the reconciliation of all humanity impact how generous we are?

672
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,920
 If we see a need, if we see them as valuable, would we do something?

673
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,680
 Would it impact our willingness to engage in different justice efforts around the city

674
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,480
 to bring dignity to those who are vulnerable?

675
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,560
 A really fun and simple way, we have these things called neighborhood conversations where

676
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,240
 all you do is walk around and get to know our neighborhood.

677
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,120
 Could the reconciliation of you and God leading to the reconciliation of you and your neighbor

678
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,160
 encourage you to maybe join a space where you just get to know the people in your neighborhood?

679
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,760
 Because I mean, if you're going to love them, you might as well maybe get to know them first,

680
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
 right?

681
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,120
 Can you really love what you don't know?

682
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,920
 God would say this in 1 John that how is it that you don't love your brother who you can

683
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,160
 see, but you claim to love me who you can't see?

684
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,920
 All right?

685
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,320
 So could we take steps like that?

686
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,520
 Could we make a conscious effort?

687
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
 I know that we're busy.

688
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,880
 I understand that Hong Kong's busy.

689
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,200
 I have worked for a church, but I'm busy too.

690
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
 I get it.

691
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,820
 But I think we remember that this is an eternal purpose from the beginning.

692
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:20,360
 This was God's plan to bring people together to yes, reconcile us with him.

693
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:27,120
 But man, the statement, the display that we are when we have different values and approaches

694
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,960
 and preferences and some people support like, is it Liverpool or what team do you like?

695
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
 Manchester United?

696
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
 Yeah, right?

697
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,000
 Like when Hudson can like Manchester United and I can still like Hudson, that says a lot

698
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,160
 about the reconciliation of God in this family.

699
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,720
 I know it's a silly example, guys, but the cuts that do run in our society run quite

700
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
 deep.

701
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
 All right?

702
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,200
 If we could allow what God has done for us and what he wants to take place in humanity

703
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,300
 to drive us into reconciliation with one another, we do become a light.

704
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,440
 We do become salt to the earth.

705
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,440
 Not salty.

706
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,840
 We become salt to the earth.

707
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,880
 And we display a wise, powerful, intentional God.

708
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,440
 It invites people into our community.

709
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,600
 It gives people value and inerrant worth.

710
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,680
 And this is the mystery of the gospel.

711
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
 This is what Paul is saying.

712
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,760
 And this is my heart for our community.

713
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,820
 This is Pastor Andrew and our elders.

714
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,120
 This is what they want this church to be.

715
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:34,280
 Not just a group of people gathered, but people with differences, putting those things aside,

716
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,000
 counting it as lost because of the surpassing knowledge of Jesus Christ and the unifying

717
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,880
 work that he's doing in our reconciliation.

718
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:50,240
 So would you stand with me and we'll pray together?

719
00:42:50,240 --> 00:43:02,800
 Yeah, I recognize that this is a dense passage.

720
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,560
 It's a lot of words.

721
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,680
 But maybe for you it's just honing in on two or three things.

722
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,720
 Or one or two things.

723
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,020
 What it means to love our neighbor.

724
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,160
 That's what God is calling us to do.

725
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,760
 To be reconciled with him and to be right standing with those around us.

726
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,520
 If we boil it down to that, then what we're asking God for is a deepening of our reconciliation

727
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,360
 with him.

728
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:34,720
 And the strength and the vision and the fortitude to be able to live that reconciliation with

729
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,120
 humanity intentionally displaying into the world.

730
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,640
 That we would be a church that's not known for anything other than displaying the wisdom

731
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
 of God.

732
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,960
 And it's his heart for us.

733
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,560
 So maybe you have to ask yourself one of those two questions.

734
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,040
 What does it look like to be so convinced by the gospel that I'd let anybody in?

735
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,800
 That I would love anyone around me?

736
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,920
 And God, I think for those of us who are asking ourselves that question, would you continue

737
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,240
 to flood us again anew with the meaning of your reconciliation with us?

738
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,960
 Would you remind us of the power of the blood and the power of your broken body and what

739
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,360
 that meant, what you endured, and just exactly what you did so that we could know you more.

740
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,000
 So that there'd be no barriers between you and us.

741
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,720
 That the veil is torn and we have access to a God.

742
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,360
 You've made a way for us to know you, to walk with you, and for you to be present with us

743
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
 always.

744
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,160
 God, I pray that you would just remind us of the joys of our salvation.

745
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:46,280
 And that that would be the bedrock, that would be the foundation upon where we muster up

746
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,840
 the strength, knowing that we can only love because you first loved us.

747
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:56,800
 God, may your example lead us bravely and boldly into acts of reconciliation with those

748
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,800
 around us.

749
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,600
 Give us the strength to forgive if that's what we need to do.

750
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,320
 Give us the ability to listen.

751
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:09,560
 God, give us the ability to assume the best about our neighbor, maybe not the worst.

752
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,680
 Yeah, God, you know what it looks like for all of our spaces.

753
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,760
 Would you speak into that?

754
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,120
 And Holy Spirit, for those of us who are pondering the question of what it looks like to go and

755
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:27,600
 be you displayed out into our society, to be a river that brings you to the world, I

756
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,040
 pray that you would give us the comfort of knowing that we don't go alone.

757
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,440
 And actually what makes, what value we bring is the fact that you go with us.

758
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,680
 And so would you comfort us?

759
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,080
 Would you give us ideas and suggestions?

760
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,560
 Would you illuminate what it looks like to live in a reconciled relationship with our

761
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:51,200
 coworkers, with our bosses, with those in our offices, with our families, with our communities,

762
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,760
 with those in Hong Kong?

763
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,880
 Could you show us what it looks like to truly bring the water of life to a dry and weary

764
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,320
 land?

765
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:09,480
 Could you let us see that the church is made for so much more?

766
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:15,520
 May we not just be a church that gathers and does church, but may we be a church that goes

767
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,200
 and carries the church outside of this building.

768
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,480
 And may your wisdom, your manifold wisdom be on full display for the world and for the

769
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:31,520
 spiritual powers through this community of believers gathered in the name of Jesus.

770
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,360
 Amen.
