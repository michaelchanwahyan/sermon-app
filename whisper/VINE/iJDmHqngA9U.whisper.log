[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   How's everyone doing?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   (audience murmurs)
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.680]   Uh-oh, is it the weather?
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.640]   (audience murmurs)
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.240]   Do we have to pray for the weather?
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.320]   Please don't, I love this kind of weather.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.160]   (audience laughs)
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.800]   I'm gonna spend Christmas in Singapore,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.160]   I'm gonna miss this weather.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.000]   (audience murmurs)
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   (laughs)
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.000]   Anyway, anybody loves movie here?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660]   Okay, two of you, three of you, that's not too bad.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.760]   I wanna give you a little bit of local culture
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.080]   sort of information.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.320]   If you've been around town lately,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.800]   if you've been walking on the streets
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.980]   or scrolling on social media,
[00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.720]   there's actually a local movie
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.200]   that's under the spotlight right now.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.480]   It receives so much attention
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.720]   because it hit $80 million box office
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.040]   in just two weeks time.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.840]   Just to give you a bit of context,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.760]   in Hong Kong cinema history,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.480]   there's only been one movie so far
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   that has hit the 100 million mark,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.640]   and this one, it's quite likely to be the second one.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.640]   And so it receives a lot of attention,
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.560]   a lot of people are talking about it,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.920]   and yeah, it has a very interesting name,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.480]   interesting title, it's called "The Last Dance,"
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.760]   or "The Last Dance," for all my British friends here.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.720]   (audience laughs)
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.200]   All right, it's actually about a Taoist priest
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.960]   and, or about a wedding planner
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.800]   who somehow entered into the funeral industry by chance,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.200]   and he had to partner with this Taoist priest,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.720]   and through this whole process,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.920]   this wedding planner turned into a funeral planner.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.960]   He was learning about life and death
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.240]   through this whole funeral experience.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.340]   And while the name, the Chinese name of this movie
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.160]   was actually taken from the very rituals
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160]   that Taoists perform at a Chinese funeral,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.620]   but it's not about all these religious
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.880]   or spiritual practices.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   It's more about finding out the meaning of life and death.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.240]   But today, I don't wanna talk about this movie.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.280]   I'm not gonna spoil it for you guys.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.120]   I do wanna zoom in a little bit
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.480]   into one particular character.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.040]   So there is this family behind the screen,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.760]   behind me on the screen, there is this family,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.560]   the oldest guy, it's the Taoist priest.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080]   He perform all the rituals.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.760]   In Chinese, we call him (speaks in foreign language)
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.240]   and he does all the very funny dance,
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.200]   and so that's what he does.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.720]   And he actually has a son,
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.760]   and very conveniently, his son followed
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.640]   his father's footsteps and also became a Taoist priest,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.160]   and this would be his son right here.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.900]   But somehow, this son of his,
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.480]   who himself is a Taoist priest,
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.260]   he actually married a Catholic lady,
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.880]   or a Christian, a Catholic lady,
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.360]   and they gave birth to a very cute son,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.600]   and the son follow his mom to be a Catholic.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.200]   And so this is a true Hong Kong story
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.240]   in many different sense,
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.200]   but one of the way it's very Hong Kong
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.320]   is that as this boy is growing up,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   he needs to apply for a school.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.060]   And of course, his mom would want him to apply
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.560]   to get into a Catholic school or a Christian school,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.360]   and this is a true Hong Kong story
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.520]   because the school said if both parents
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.720]   are baptized into the church,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.080]   the boy would get extra points to get into the school.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.220]   Very Hong Kong, right?
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.520]   So like what all mothers would do,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.640]   this mom, wearing that hat behind the husband,
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.200]   required, asked the husband,
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.660]   "Hey, could you get baptized?"
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.720]   She asked a Taoist priest to get baptized,
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.320]   and of course, for the son, the priest said,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   "Yeah, I'll do it, I'll do it for him."
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.920]   And later, okay, I know this is a bit of a spoiler,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.920]   but I promise, just this little bit, all right?
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.000]   You can still go to watch the movie.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.400]   It's still very enjoyable with this little bit of spoiler.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.060]   So there was one time the whole family was having dinner,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.160]   and the wife was doing this,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.720]   "Hey, hey, hey."
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.320]   Like what?
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.360]   Hey, now you're baptized.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.120]   You gotta say grace before your dinner.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.800]   And so the Taoist priest, the younger one,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.700]   was forced to say grace in front of the entire family,
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.080]   and you could imagine what his father would react to that.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.220]   It's funny, you know, there are so many,
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.980]   there are so many modern movies and TV shows
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.840]   that they would include kind of like a Christian character
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.600]   or a character with Christian or Catholic faith background
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.880]   into the plot.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.320]   And in other shows and movies we watch,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.960]   we sometimes would see that.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.240]   Yet, it's also not uncommon that the portrayal
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.840]   of these characters and their faith
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.000]   sometimes is quite negative.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.880]   In pop culture, when a Christian is in the plot of a movie
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.840]   or a TV show, well, at best, that character,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.920]   what they wanna show you is that this character
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.600]   is quite committed,
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.680]   or this character has very strong moral values.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.320]   But strong moral values sometimes means this character
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.400]   is sort of like conservative.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.560]   Or old-fashioned.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.520]   Or stubborn, illogical,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.560]   judgmental, and worst case scenario,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.800]   this guy is hypocritical.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.720]   This is how Christians are being seen
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.080]   in our modern day pop culture or in entertainment.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.840]   And sometimes we think that, you know what,
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.400]   this is just stereotype,
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.280]   just because they never step foot in a church,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.400]   they never meet people like you and me,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.000]   that's why they have such a stereotype.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.760]   Perhaps that's what we're thinking.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.480]   To a certain degree, I agree,
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.160]   because they haven't met you guys,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.680]   so that's why they don't know better, right?
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.900]   But maybe some of us here, we're rather new to this faith.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.480]   Maybe a couple weeks ago, you were not Christians yet,
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.600]   and that's also how you used to see Christianity,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.680]   that's how you used to see Christians,
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.000]   that's how you used to see people in the church.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.560]   We're like, old-fashioned, judgmental, hypocritical,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.880]   until you have an encounter with Jesus himself
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.120]   and you join a community of faith
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.240]   and you find, oh, maybe it's not that bad,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.240]   it's a little bit different.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.960]   Or maybe you're sitting here right now
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.320]   even feeling a little bit uncomfortable
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.240]   when you hear the name Christian
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.440]   being associated with all these qualities
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.040]   I just mentioned.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.440]   But my point is, collectively as a church,
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.600]   we may have certain reputations.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:47.000]   I know some of you understand what I'm talking about,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.320]   I can feel it.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.720]   I know sometimes those labels on us,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.420]   they may not do us justice,
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.160]   but I would also like to call us
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.480]   to a place of reflection today, church.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.840]   What do these impressions about Christians come from?
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.440]   Where do they come from?
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.600]   What are we known for in this city?
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.560]   What are we known for as a church here in Yuen Long?
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.000]   Interestingly, when we open up the New Testament
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   and look at a group of people
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.280]   who are known as the Pharisees,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.080]   they have certain reputations as well.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.920]   As a New Testament reader, as we read through this book,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.580]   we probably form our opinions about them
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.760]   based on the narratives and the comments
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.240]   about this, you know, in the gospel story
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.680]   about this group of people.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.900]   And we normally know the Pharisees as they're stubborn,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.440]   they're judgmental, legalistic,
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.500]   a self-righteous, hypocritic.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.840]   That's what, that's how we see them.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.320]   And surely if one of them, one of these Pharisees,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.960]   if they were alive today,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   and if he stand right here with us in this room right now,
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.940]   he would tell you,
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.160]   or he would try to tell you a different story.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.960]   He would try to disagree with all the labels we had on them.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.480]   And he would start to explain to us
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.720]   what Pharisees believe in
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.780]   and what they, what are the practices all about.
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.140]   They were actually a group or a movement
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.040]   started about 150 years before the time of Jesus.
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.320]   That's a period of time between the Old Testament
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.160]   and the New Testament.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.800]   And just as the prophet Daniel prophesied
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.440]   in the Old Testament,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.760]   there were rulers or nations rising to power
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.280]   to rule over the Jews or Israel
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.800]   after they returned from exile.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.760]   We know that Persia actually replaced Babylon
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.840]   as the new superpower.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.680]   And then we all heard about Alexander the Great,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.520]   his Greek empire took over the entire region.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.160]   And then it was the Romans.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.220]   But when Alexander the Great,
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.160]   when the Greek empire took over that area,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.960]   they tried to do something.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.160]   Well, the Romans actually copied them as well.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.520]   They tried to export their own culture,
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.840]   their language, their practices, their philosophies.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   They've been teaching everyone in the entire empire
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.880]   in different regions, how to talk right in Greek,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.360]   how to think like a Greek, they've been doing that.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.520]   So that's why in the New Testament,
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.160]   the language of the Bible is no longer written in Hebrew.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.920]   It's actually written in Greek, Koine Greek.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.680]   Oh, yes, yes, positive, yes.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.720]   It's Koine Greek, it's not classical Greek,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.440]   it's not the modern Greek we're reading.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.920]   It's a very special form of Greek
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.920]   that was popular during that time.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.080]   But we read the New Testament or it's written in Greek.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.400]   But not just that.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   When this language, we do have a lot of Hong Kongers here
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.160]   who are slightly more mature in age,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.520]   who were born before 1997.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.080]   So you would have a sense of, you know what it means
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.760]   to be in a colony.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:06.000]   Well, some of us here, like myself, I'm Chinese,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.320]   well, speaking about my ethnicity,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.120]   but I grew up learning English.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.880]   That's why I can preach here today.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.240]   I grew up learning English because we were a British colony.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.720]   And I don't just learn English, I learn,
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.080]   I pick up the way how English speakers would think.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.840]   I pick up the way, I pick up Western philosophies as well.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.560]   Because of that, I pick up a little bit,
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.640]   just a little bit of Westerner kind of lifestyle.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.320]   So when these Jewish people,
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.680]   when they were being influenced by the Greek or Roman culture,
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.680]   it's not just the language they spoke that was influenced.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.640]   It's also the way they think, the way they see life,
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.920]   and they slowly shifted away
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.120]   from the original Hebrew roots.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.320]   And there was a group of Jewish people, they saw that.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   They saw how the people are no longer rooted in their faith,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.760]   in this Hebrew faith of theirs.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.640]   And so they decided to do something.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.840]   And they recognize that if there's one thing
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.720]   that sets them apart from the rest of all the other nations
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.480]   or people around them, that would actually be God's word.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.760]   More precisely, that would be the law of God,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.480]   the law of Moses.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.800]   And so this particular group of people,
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.480]   they started devoting themselves to studying,
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.960]   translating a little bit as well,
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.560]   studying, they copy it, and they started teaching
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.080]   the word of God or the law or the prophets.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.720]   And these group of people, they said,
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.120]   "We must align our lifestyle
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.000]   "with the standard of the law of Moses."
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.160]   And that's not enough.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.080]   Sometimes we don't know specifically in our everyday life
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.840]   how we can actually practice that.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.040]   So perhaps we should come up,
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.000]   we should extend it a little bit,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.400]   give it a little bit of commentary,
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   and we have all these oral traditions.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.000]   And this group of people, now we know them as the Pharisees.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.960]   If we look at the name Pharisee itself,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.600]   it's actually from an Aramaic word called perushim.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.480]   It actually means to separate, to divide, or distinguish.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.560]   So they are saying, "We are the separated ones.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.440]   "We're the ones who are set apart."
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.760]   Does that ring a bell?
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.400]   Does that sound familiar?
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.520]   Maybe you've heard of it in the church before as well.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.560]   We are the holy one, we are the separated ones,
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.200]   we are the one that are set apart.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.960]   And they just keep doing this and doing this.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.360]   They try their best to interpret whatever laws
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   they know about and how to apply that
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.120]   in their everyday life.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.000]   And so, and they come up with more and more
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.560]   and more rules and traditions.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.120]   If there's one thing this group of Pharisees
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.040]   they want to be known for,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.600]   they want to be known as the righteous people.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.880]   They want to be known as the pious people.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.640]   But fast forward 150 years later,
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.840]   when we meet them in the stories of the New Testament,
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.160]   their reputation wasn't quite what they wished for.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.400]   Self-righteous, legalistic, judgmental, hypocritical,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.160]   these were their reputations.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.840]   And this is how they are remembered
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.080]   for thousands of years now.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   And the problem is church.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.000]   There was a gap between what their beliefs stood for
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.160]   and what they were known for.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.480]   Let me repeat again.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.920]   I believe this group of Pharisees,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.360]   when they first started,
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.840]   they have every good intention to honor God,
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.080]   to do His will,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.000]   but what their beliefs actually stood for
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.520]   and what they were ultimately known for,
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.920]   there's a gap there.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.720]   And that's a problem or a question for us today as well.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.240]   When we look at our reputation as a church in the city
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.960]   or as the church in the city or in this world,
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   is there a gap between what our faith stands for
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.160]   and what we're known for?
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.840]   So we reflect on this together today.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.640]   I do wanna open the Bible
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.640]   and read yet another of Jesus's parables with us today.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.960]   We're going to look at Luke 14,
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.480]   and here's the background in first one.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.280]   Luke 14, first one, it says this.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.880]   One Sabbath when Jesus went to eat
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.040]   in a house of a prominent Pharisee,
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.400]   He was being carefully watched.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.080]   One verse, but there's tons of information
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.360]   in this single verse.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.400]   So first of all, this is a Sabbath.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.960]   And it's important because, again, spoiler alert,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.800]   a miracle is gonna happen in this chapter,
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.280]   and it's gonna take place later.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.200]   In the Gospels, all together,
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.800]   in all four Gospels all together,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.200]   there were seven recorded miracles on Sabbath.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.320]   And this is the last healing miracle on Sabbath
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.200]   in the writings of Luke, and there were two before it.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.840]   But every single time when Jesus performed
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.720]   a healing miracle or any miracle on Sabbath,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.000]   the result was always that some kind of tension
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.680]   and conflict would rise up between Him and the Pharisees.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   Because in the Pharisees' interpretation of the law,
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.640]   no work is to be done on Sabbath, like not at all.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.520]   And performing miracle, healing someone,
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.400]   it's actually work.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.840]   It's productivity, I guess.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.960]   You get someone healed, hallelujah.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.080]   But that means if Jesus heals someone on Sabbath,
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.880]   He's breaking the law.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.200]   He's breaking the law of Moses.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.520]   That makes Him a very terrible person,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.640]   or at least according to their version
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.120]   or their interpretation of the law.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.640]   And so now a leader of the Pharisees invited Jesus
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.520]   for a meal in his house, and they are watching Him.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.040]   My eyes are on you.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.880]   We're watching you.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.760]   The immediate story tells us that there was a man
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.760]   that was ill with a disease called dropsy,
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.080]   some sort of swelling in the body.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.720]   But this is interesting.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.520]   Sick people, like we've always explained here,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.160]   sick people in those days are considered,
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.880]   they're normally, they're probably sinners.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.320]   And these Pharisees who wanna set apart from bad people,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.480]   from sinful people, they try to stay away from them
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.760]   as much as possible.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.640]   But in the house of a Pharisee leader,
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.600]   there is a sick person.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.160]   There's a possibly sinner here.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.240]   So I could only guess this is probably a setup
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.760]   'cause they're watching what Jesus is gonna do.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.280]   This is totally a setup.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.600]   But you know that every time you put a sick person
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.080]   with Jesus in the same room,
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.760]   there's only one thing that could happen.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.000]   The sick person walks out being healed.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.400]   I think we need more of that, amen?
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.440]   We need more, we need to put sick people
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.000]   in the same room with Jesus more so that they get healed
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.800]   so Jesus would perform His miracles.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.640]   We need that.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.040]   And so that's what happened.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.720]   And then this is what's happened next.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.160]   I'm gonna start from verse seven.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.880]   So when Jesus noticed how the guests
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.800]   picked the places of honor at the table,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.600]   He told them this parable.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.120]   When someone invites you to a wedding feast,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.880]   do not take the place of honor
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.880]   for a person more distinguished
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.040]   than you may have been invited.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.680]   If so, the host who invited both of you
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.400]   will come and say to you, give this person your seat.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.440]   Then humiliated, you will have to take
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.520]   the least important place.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   But when you are invited, take the lowest place
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.520]   so that when your host comes,
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.920]   he will say to you, friend, move up to a better place.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.120]   Then you will be honored in the presence
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.680]   of all the other guests.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.560]   For all those who exhort themselves will be humbled
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.880]   and those who humble themselves will be exhorted.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.840]   Then Jesus said to His host,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.160]   when you give a luncheon or dinner,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.160]   do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters,
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.360]   your relatives or your rich neighbors.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.800]   If you do, they may invite you back
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.760]   and so you will be repaid.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.760]   But when you give a banquet,
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.600]   invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.040]   and you will be blessed.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.800]   Although they cannot repay you,
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.240]   So first of all, when we look at this passage,
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.720]   who are these guests?
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.920]   Easy, those are the Pharisees, teachers,
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.880]   experts of the law who come all the way
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.760]   just to watch Jesus.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.840]   And here Luke described Jesus noticed
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.080]   how they picked the places of honor,
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.840]   the front row seats, the head table at the banquet.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.440]   To give you a little bit of context,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.600]   in a Jewish feast those days,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.040]   they adopted the Greco-Roman furniture called a triclinium.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.960]   Oh, that's this table right here.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.040]   It's a couch for three people
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.160]   and they will put different triclinia together
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.040]   and they will arrange it in a U shape.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.840]   And what they do is the guests would recline on this table
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.040]   on their left elbow.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.960]   They would all recline like this
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.720]   and they eat and they chat.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.040]   That's how they spend the evening.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.600]   I don't know how they can do that all night.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.320]   If I do this for 50 minutes, I'll have a cramp.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.760]   I don't know how to do that, but that's their culture.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.120]   And the places of honor,
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.440]   it's here in the center of that table.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.960]   And also those seats like right next to him,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.520]   those on his left, on his right,
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.160]   who would either sit at his back
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.200]   or the other one who would be sitting there
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.120]   and leaning into his bosom.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.600]   These are the places of honor.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.120]   And Jesus was saying, hey, do not pick these.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.720]   In today's culture, this would be the head table,
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.920]   the front row seat where you have a sign VIP there.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.080]   So these people, they want to be VIPs.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.360]   The Pharisees like to pick these places of honor.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.880]   Jesus actually mentioned this in different locations
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.720]   in the Bible.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.920]   If you flip through all the gospels,
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.920]   you would see Jesus commenting on this practice
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.280]   or this behavior that they like the VIP seats,
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.160]   they like to be VIP.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.520]   And so Jesus, he decided to tell them something,
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.920]   to share a message with them.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.560]   But what's interesting here is that this message,
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.280]   which appear, Jesus was just addressing that behavior,
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.240]   kind of like what Jesus was telling these Pharisees.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.360]   It's just what's happening regarding the scene right there.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.000]   And in fact, he didn't just comment
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.840]   on their behavior on the spot.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.960]   He turned this whole scenario into a parable.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.080]   He wanted to tell them something about the kingdom of God
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.480]   through this scenario.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.760]   So Jesus, all these words, yes, it relate directly.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.200]   It's relevant directly to what happened
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.400]   in that house of the Pharisee that night.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.760]   But Jesus wanted to tell them something more than that.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.640]   Jesus wanted to tell them something
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.640]   about the kingdom of God,
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.880]   because his conclusion in verse 11 is this,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.920]   "For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.960]   "and all those who humble themselves will be exalted."
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.120]   These are the exact wordings found in another parable
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.920]   about the Pharisees' prayer
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.800]   and the tax collector's prayer in Luke 18.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.440]   And Pastor John preached that to us several weeks ago.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.800]   But why is this parable in the Pharisees' house?
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.000]   Why is it a parable about the kingdom of God?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.760]   Why don't we take a closer look?
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.840]   It says, "The proud will be humbled,
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.960]   "and the humbled will be exalted."
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.560]   So in English, you know, grammar, this is passive tense.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.480]   They will be humbled, they will be exalted.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.600]   Now, the question is, who is going to exalt them?
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.960]   Who is going to humble them?
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.800]   And this is the kind of writing technique of the Jews.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.480]   The scholars of the Bible actually call this grammar
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.240]   or this figure of speech, they call it the divine passive,
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.120]   meaning that they omitted the mentioning of God here
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.080]   as a form of respect.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.720]   But Jesus was indeed pointing to the moment
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.560]   of the final judgment,
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   when God himself will be there, sit in front of everyone.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.840]   And all those who exalt themselves
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.520]   while they're in this life, God is going to humble them.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.400]   Those who humble themselves in this life,
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.360]   God is going to exalt them, God is going to raise them up.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.000]   This is God's doing, this is what he wants to do.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.480]   It may appear here that Jesus was giving them
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.560]   a word of advice about the social life,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   but if we look closer, Jesus really wanted to communicate
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.680]   the ultimate reality that they and all of us here,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.800]   it's going to face one day.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.080]   And so church, get ready for that.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.760]   Because how you choose to live in this life
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.360]   would affect how you spend eternity.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.840]   You can try every day, try your very best
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.040]   to promote yourself, to gain status, to be powerful,
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.640]   to be famous, to look good in front of other people,
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   trying to be somebody while you are in this life.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.200]   And then you spend eternity as a nobody.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.720]   Or you can live your life in a way
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.240]   that as though you are a nobody here
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.040]   in this part of the world, in this life.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.080]   And the day when you stand before the King of Kings,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.880]   the Lord of Lords, when you stand before his throne,
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.360]   he will tell you, my son, my friend,
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.920]   come, I have the place of honor for you.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.080]   You are my VIP in my kingdom.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.360]   Everybody will know you as somebody in eternity.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.080]   It's our choice, it's up to us.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.640]   He's asking us, what would you choose?
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.600]   How are you going to choose in your everyday life
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.720]   while you're on this side of eternity?
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.360]   And the most beautiful thing here is that we thought,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.600]   yeah, Jesus is rebuking these Pharisees.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.080]   Say, you know, you guys are so bad.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.520]   But in fact, Jesus is giving them a choice,
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.640]   offering them a choice.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   Jesus is warning them, God would humble you one day
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.800]   if you don't humble yourself right now.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.720]   But he also invites them into the humility,
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.600]   into humbling themselves, so one day,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.840]   when they stand before the judgment of God,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.560]   they will actually be exalted by God.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.200]   Jesus is not here to condemn them right now.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.120]   He's inviting them into that ultimate reality.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.240]   I do want to exalt you, my friends,
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.720]   but first you do have to humble yourself in this life
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.240]   so that one day when I meet you in that final judgment,
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.520]   I can exalt you.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.520]   And as Christians, I'm sure we've all heard
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.600]   about the virtue of humility,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.640]   but this is the tricky part, church.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.200]   I struggled with that myself as well in my life.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.640]   If we spend the rest of our lives trying to be humble,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.520]   trying to do or say all sorts of things to look humble,
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.640]   to sound humble, and at the end of the day,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.520]   oh, we go home, we look at ourselves and say,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.720]   oh, I'm such a humble person today.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.200]   When I talk to Pastor Tim, oh, I was so humble just now.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.360]   Oh, when I talk to my friend, oh, I'm such a nice guy.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.520]   I finally achieved humility.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.160]   Oh, so good, right?
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   That's the voice of pride speaking, right?
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.680]   And so let me do read you a paragraph from C.S. Lewis.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.080]   He says this.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.160]   Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.520]   he will be what most people call humble nowadays.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.880]   He will not be sort of greasy, you know, swarmy person
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.440]   who is always telling you that, of course, he's nobody.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.000]   He's not gonna say that to you.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.040]   Probably all you will think about him
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.800]   is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.840]   who took a real interest in what you said to him.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.600]   If you do dislike him,
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.000]   it will be because you feel a little bit envious of anyone
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.840]   who seems to enjoy life so easily.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.960]   He will not be thinking about humility.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.560]   Well, in fact, he will not be thinking about himself at all.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.480]   Okay, if anyone, if you need to take picture, do it now.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   I'm gonna move on.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.160]   And there's another pastor, Pastor Rick Warren.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.040]   He said something quite similar,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.640]   which is complimentary to what I read just now.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.200]   He said, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.520]   "It is thinking of yourself less.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.400]   "Humility is thinking more of others.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.280]   "Humble people are so focused on serving others,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.440]   "they don't think of themselves."
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   And so you see, here's the problem with the Pharisees.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.240]   Yes, they've been trying to obey the law.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.800]   They've been trying to fulfill all these requirements,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.320]   but their focus was still on themselves.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.040]   They thought about themselves too much.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.400]   If we focus solely on ourselves,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.640]   our pursuit of righteousness
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.640]   will eventually turn into self-righteousness.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.080]   Let me say that again.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.520]   If we focus solely on ourselves,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.320]   our pursuit of righteousness
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.360]   will inevitably lead to self-righteousness.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.200]   I don't know what motivates us to read the Bible,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.960]   to come to church on a Sunday,
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.720]   to sing those worship songs,
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.960]   to behave like a Christian every day.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.800]   But if we are doing that for ourselves,
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.480]   if we're trying to make ourselves feel better,
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.960]   that I'm a Christian, so I'm better than,
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.640]   oh, that person sitting next to me at work,
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.480]   he's not a Christian.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.080]   You know, he has all these bad habits in life.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.960]   I'm a better man than him, and I'm sorry.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.720]   Our pursuit of righteousness
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.000]   will just turn us into another self-righteous person.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   So Jesus actually offered the antidote to pride
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.120]   in the following.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.520]   In the next story, he reads that
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.000]   when you give a luncheon or dinner,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.040]   do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters,
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.960]   your relatives, your rich neighbors.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.440]   If you do, they may invite you back
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.960]   so you will be repaid.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.680]   But when you give a banquet,
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.600]   invite the poor, the cripple, the lame, the blind,
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.080]   and you will be blessed.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.840]   Although they cannot repay you,
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   but you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:41.960]   So we gotta think about others, those around us.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:47.040]   If you can give without expecting anything in return,
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.560]   not even how much praise you will receive because of that.
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.880]   If I'm buying someone dinner,
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.240]   and I'm expecting that person to go around,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.560]   "Oh, you know, Chapman bought me dinner last night.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.120]   "He's just such a nice person."
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.200]   That's what you're getting in return.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.240]   That doesn't count if you do it for nothing in return,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.440]   and you just focus on meeting the needs of others around you,
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.720]   serving them wholeheartedly.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.360]   That's humility in God's eyes.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.400]   I remember a couple of years ago,
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.120]   before we have this church here in Yuen Long,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.560]   me, Pastor Ivan, Pastor Tim,
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.520]   we were all part of the Wan Chai pastoral staff.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.160]   And so we work in Wan Chai every Sunday.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.320]   I remember there was this particular service one Sunday.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.480]   Halfway through the service,
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.920]   the preacher has already been preaching,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.680]   speaking on the stage.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.480]   And there was a person walking through the door,
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.080]   slowly moving towards the front of the stage,
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.440]   to the front row.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.560]   And I can assure you, most of the time in Wan Chai,
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   well, like our English services,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.280]   the whole church is just very packed.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.840]   There's no seat at all,
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.760]   but he was walking on the front row.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.600]   And later I found out he might have
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.640]   a little bit of special needs.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.920]   And as the staff on the roster,
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:13.200]   when I saw that, my first response is,
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.360]   oh my gosh, he's disturbing the service.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.480]   I gotta do something.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.000]   Maybe I should bring him somewhere else.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.760]   Maybe I should put him to the back.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.080]   I was running all these different scenarios.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.160]   How should I react?
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.840]   But luckily, or unluckily, I was actually on the balcony.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.080]   I was so far away from that.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.240]   So I was just mentally, what should I do?
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.920]   What would I do if I'm down there in the lower house?
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.720]   While I was still thinking about all these,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.360]   that day, Pastor John, our founding pastor,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.040]   he was actually there in the service.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.960]   And he was sitting in the front seat,
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.560]   right in the middle on the first row.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.320]   So the next moment, what I saw was,
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.200]   as the guy was walking alongside,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.600]   I saw that John actually stood up,
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.400]   gently escorting that man to his seat.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.320]   And he quietly walked towards the back
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.880]   for the rest of the service.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   And I was watching on the balcony.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.640]   I was telling myself, he is the founding pastor.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.480]   If there's one man who deserves to remain in his seat,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.800]   that would be John.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.920]   And he taught me a lesson that day.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.520]   I look at John, I saw what he did.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.040]   And I was telling myself,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:30.440]   man, I hope one day when I am his age,
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.240]   I could do the same.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.160]   That my heart is not filled with entitlement.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.000]   Well, I'm somebody, somebody,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.640]   that somebody else should move away from their seats.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.840]   I should be here.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.600]   Somebody should be giving me their seats,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.920]   not the other way around.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.560]   I hope one day when I reach there,
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.880]   I could still do that.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:56.760]   I think sometimes we do feel we're entitled to some things
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.360]   because of how much effort we put into
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.760]   something of our expertise,
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.200]   how good or how much good we've done.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.440]   And we thought we're entitled to something.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.640]   Humility is not thinking less of yourself,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.560]   not thinking, oh, I don't deserve to be seated here.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.680]   It's not like that.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.200]   Humility is not thinking less of yourself.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.960]   Humility is simply thinking of yourself less.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.520]   Think about others.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:28.360]   I'm wondering today, if you have a seat,
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.600]   who can you give that seat to?
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.520]   Who would you give up that seat for?
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.640]   Is it only someone whom you think
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.960]   is more superior than you,
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.000]   have a high status than you,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.480]   have a better reputation than you,
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.680]   older than you, look better than you?
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.040]   Or you're just gonna give it to someone who is in need?
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.520]   What do we want to be known for as a church in our city?
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:05.000]   The Pharisee loves places of honor at feasts
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.880]   and best seats in the synagogue.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.040]   How about us?
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:14.600]   Do we or can we do the opposite
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.920]   by giving the seats to other people,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   the best seats to different people?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.720]   Can we act in a way that communicates to those around us
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.320]   that we think they are more important?
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:31.400]   Can we ask God to bring us to a place
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.560]   where we think of ourselves less
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.080]   and think of others more?
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:42.560]   That's my prayer for myself.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.040]   That's my prayer for my church family.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.640]   I do think that there is a gap
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   between what our faith stands for
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.480]   and what we're known for in the city right now.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.640]   I do think that gap exists.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.640]   My prayer, my desire is to see that the church
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.640]   will have a better reputation here.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:10.800]   But as the evangelist Moody, he says this,
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.120]   "If I take care of my character,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.480]   "my reputation will take care of itself."
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.360]   I do think we need to close that gap,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.120]   but that gap is not reputation.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.680]   That gap indeed is character.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.120]   What our faith stands for
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.080]   and how we behave what we're known for,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.720]   can we close that gap?
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.360]   And don't do it by our own power
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.400]   and don't come one day,
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.320]   oh, I finally closed that gap, I've done it.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.560]   Let's just think of ourself less.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.040]   Let's think of those around us,
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:57.120]   those in the city more in our everyday life.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:03.080]   I care deeply about the reputation of our church
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:09.400]   and the church in our city, in our world.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   And we don't need better marketing.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.040]   We don't need better branding.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.000]   We just need to work on our character.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.240]   And I need to work on my character.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.880]   (smooches)
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.280]   And I believe as we start to do that,
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.000]   as we invite the Holy Spirit into our hearts,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.800]   as we work on our character,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.800]   I believe our reputation will start to work on itself.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.480]   My dream is that somewhere in the future,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.240]   maybe in the next generation,
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.440]   when my daughters get to go into movies,
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:48.600]   when their portrayal of Christian characters in those movie,
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.200]   those characters are not known for being legalistic
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.280]   or self-righteous or hypocritic.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.720]   They'll be known for how they long to sacrifice
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.800]   for other people.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.200]   They'll be known for their service for other people.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.880]   I long for the day that this is how the world will see
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.200]   what they will see in us.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.640]   And this, we cannot control how other people
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:16.600]   see us right now.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.640]   We cannot control how they perceive us because of the past,
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.200]   but we can start today.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.680]   We can decide how they will see us tomorrow.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.840]   And I think as we draw close to a parable series,
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.000]   as God is calling us into his kingdom,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   understanding what it means,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.440]   my prayer is that by understanding the parable of Jesus,
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.640]   by understanding his heart a little bit more,
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.520]   by understanding how he wants to run his kingdom,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.600]   we will start to manifest that kingdom
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.080]   in Yuen Long and in our city.
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.120]   If you wanna be part of that,
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.920]   can I invite you to stand and pray?
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:38:13.680]   Holy Spirit, I thank you.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.240]   You always come and pour out God's love into our hearts,
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   come and heal our wounds, come and embrace us,
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   come and draw near to us so that we could feel secure,
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   we could feel loved.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.560]   I thank you for that.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.920]   But Jesus also mentioned that you would come into our hearts
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.600]   and point us into the word of God.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.840]   You would bring us into truth
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.040]   and you would transform our character
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.560]   so that we look more like Jesus.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.760]   And that's what I'm praying for right now, Holy Spirit.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.480]   Come, come and fill us.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:57.000]   Come and fill the body of Jesus in this room right now.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:07.560]   God, I don't pray that we, by our effort,
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.000]   we would close that gap between our reputation
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.120]   and what our faith actually stands for.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.400]   But I do pray that we can close that gap
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:21.480]   between your word and the reality
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.520]   of our heart and our character right now.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.600]   I pray that you would come and close that gap,
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.120]   that you would come and grow us.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.400]   We pray that we would be a community
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.680]   that really grow big people,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.520]   people who demonstrate the character of Jesus,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.960]   who shows the mercy, who shows the love,
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.560]   who shows the servant heart of Jesus in our city.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:53.000]   I pray that if there are strongholds in our hearts,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.520]   if there are things that are hindering us
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.000]   from moving in that direction,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.440]   I pray that by the power of resurrection right now,
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.360]   you would come and destroy those strongholds in our life
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:08.400]   and you will take every thought of us captive right now.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.080]   I pray that we could align our hearts
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.480]   with yours today once again, Lord.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.760]   Come and fill us.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   Come and fill us up, Lord.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.720]   We need your grace.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.120]   We need your mercy.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.600]   We need your encouragement.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.200]   We need you to come and be that fire inside of us.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.440]   Keep burning inside of us.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.560]   Until our hearts fully burn for Jesus
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.240]   and we only live for him.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.120]   So come, Lord.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.680]   So come, Lord.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.520]   (water trickling)
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.100]   (gentle music)
