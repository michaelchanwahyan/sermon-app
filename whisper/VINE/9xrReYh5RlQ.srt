1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 "When he shall come with trumpet sound, and may I then in him be found, dressed in his

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,000
 righteousness alone, faultless I stand before his throne."

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,480
 The words of that beautiful modern hymn that we just heard our choir sing center us into

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,680
 one of the most important themes of the whole Advent series that we've been doing here at

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,000
 The Vine in 2024.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,400
 As I've been saying each week, we're centering Advent in this idea, not just in the arrival

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,400
 of Christ in his first coming, but also this excitement for him in his second coming.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,160
 In that hymn, we just hear this cry, don't we?

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,980
 When the trumpets sound, we know that Christ is going to return.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,200
 When he does, here's how I want to be found.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,640
 The writer here says, "Dressed in his righteousness alone."

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,680
 It's a beautiful phrase.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,400
 It's one that we've sung many times here at The Vine.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,320
 I wonder whether you've actually ever absorbed it into your spirit.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,480
 This thought that the author here is expressing confidence in the future arrival of Christ

16
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,280
 and what will happen on that day for them, and their confidence is not found in themselves.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,720
 It's actually a beautiful thing because I think we can overlook this really easily.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,760
 He's not saying on that day, "I'm going to be confident because I've lived a good life."

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,440
 He's not saying on that day, "I'm going to have joy and confidence because I've done

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,520
 the right things."

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,120
 He says, "No, on that day, here's where my confidence is found.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'm going to be dressed only in his righteousness.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,320
 There's nothing else that I need, nothing else that I can get or gain to get me into

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,440
 heaven to get me in right relationship with him other than what he has done."

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:49,040
 In other words, my confidence is found in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,000
 The pain, the price for my sin and my brokenness, and because of that, I'm going to stand there

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,360
 on that day dressed in that righteousness.

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,560
 And because I'll be dressed in that righteousness, I'll have confidence that I'll be welcomed

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
 into his loving arms.

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,660
 What the song is trying to betray to us is, I think, one of the most important things

31
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,320
 that Paul is saying in that passage that we've based this series in where he says, "Look,

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,760
 we're living in a now but not yet time and there are gaps, gaps in our knowledge, gaps

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
 in our understanding, but we're not left alone in those gaps.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,800
 You know, God sent some things to help lift us up in those gaps and then one of those

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,520
 things, perhaps the most critical, is exactly this confidence that we have being dressed

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,000
 in his righteousness alone.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 It's the theme of hope."

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,160
 Oh, yes, hope.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,680
 You know, Paul would say that the three things that remain, right, are faith, hope, and love.

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,640
 And he tells us that the greatest of these is love.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,800
 And that's what we're going to look at next week.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,120
 I'm going to unpack that idea of why love is the greatest next week.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,360
 But although it might be true that love is the greatest, I think actually it is hope

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
 that is currently most needed.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,600
 In fact, I would put it to us like this.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,720
 I think we're living in a world right now that is in a crisis of hope.

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,800
 I don't know what your conversations have been lately with people over lunches or coffees

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,160
 or in bars or drinks after work, but it's very easy, isn't it, to hear the doom and

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:28,000
 gloom and downcastness, the helplessness, the sense of hopelessness that so many are

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
 holding in our city.

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,760
 I think this is particularly a reality in Hong Kong because we've had a challenging

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,400
 last five years, have we not?

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,760
 It was really interesting.

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,320
 I was in our market last week.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,200
 We had a market, if you weren't here last week, this cool market outside after the services.

56
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,240
 And one of the stalls was run by this great organization called Eden.

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,520
 And Eden create jewelry and they raise money to help with anti-human trafficking.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,560
 They have this card that they printed up, and when somebody comes to them in one of

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,880
 the markets that they're doing here in Hong Kong, they give the person a card.

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,600
 And on that card it has a bunch of words.

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,360
 And these are biblical words, but they're just words there.

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,920
 And what they say to the person is, "All of our jewelry is based on these words.

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,480
 I want you to choose the word that resonates with you the most, the word that connects

64
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,560
 to your spirit the most or the thing that you feel you need the most."

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,020
 And here's what they told me last week.

66
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,280
 They said out of all of the young people in Hong Kong that come forward in the store and

67
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,800
 they give that card to, the one word they choose, the one thing that they feel like

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,160
 they need the most, can you guess what it is?

69
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,960
 The word hope.

70
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,040
 The word hope.

71
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,440
 And it's not just the young people of our city that are struggling with this.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,120
 I think all of us are in some ways wrestling with, is this still the place we want to be

73
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
 in?

74
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,200
 Is Hong Kong going to recover?

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,440
 Are there going to be some signs at some point where we'll feel like everything's going to

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
 go well?

77
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
 Are rents going to come back down?

78
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,800
 Is money going to go back up?

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
 Am I going to get a job?

80
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,920
 Is everything going to get settled again?

81
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,960
 And there's this sort of sense of helplessness or hopelessness in our city.

82
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
 And here's the reality.

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,400
 It's not just our city.

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,640
 It's the whole world at the moment.

85
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,720
 I mean, if we just lift our heads up a little bit and look at BBC or CNN or any of the other

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,200
 news outlets and we begin to see what's going on around the world, we can see that that

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,960
 sense of helplessness and hopelessness is pervasive in our world right now.

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
 And here's the thing.

89
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,760
 There's actually a lot of good evidence to suggest that we don't have much hope right

90
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
 now.

91
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,720
 I mean, if you just look at some of the economic disparities that we're seeing in the world

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,200
 right now, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,880
 And that gap is widening more now than in any other time in history.

94
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,200
 Have a think about exploitation.

95
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,280
 There's more human trafficking than ever before.

96
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,640
 There's more forced labor migration than ever before.

97
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,280
 The poor and the vulnerable are being exploited like they've never been before.

98
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,440
 Look at the realities of movement, migration, and displacement in the world.

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,760
 Asylum seekers and refugees, something dear to our hearts here at the Vine, they're struggling

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,560
 around globally more than ever before.

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,800
 And when you begin to put all this together, you realize that there is more violence in

102
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,840
 our world, it seems, than ever before.

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
 There's more wars that are happening.

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
 And wars, here's the thing, when wars happen, it is always the innocent that seems to suffer

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,880
 most, like children.

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,560
 And we've seen that over the last couple of years, perhaps more than ever.

107
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,400
 And when we weigh this all up, it's not a surprise, perhaps, that there's a sense of

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,200
 helplessness on us, a sense of hopelessness.

109
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,960
 And I want to be honest with you.

110
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,720
 Here's what I hear at the Vine.

111
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,080
 I hear the same kind of helplessness amongst us in conversations I'm having with you, in

112
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,820
 conversations you're having with our pastors.

113
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,920
 We know that that sense of helplessness, that sense of hopelessness, is even pervasive into

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,400
 the church, which is really interesting because surely the church should be filled with people

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,280
 who are the most hopeful, but the reality are, if you're anything like me, you struggle

116
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,160
 with this too.

117
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,280
 But it isn't always easy, is it, to find hope within us.

118
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
 And despite everything that's happening and all the feelings that we're feeling and the

119
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,680
 realities of the evidence that we're seeing, I want to call you over the next 30 minutes

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
 or so to take a stand against despair.

121
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,600
 Come on, church.

122
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,200
 If there's ever a community of people around this world that in a time of a hope crisis

123
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,880
 should be rising up with an alternative way of seeing the world, an alternative narrative

124
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,200
 of saying that there's actually something better, that there is something to hope for,

125
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,640
 there is something to long for, that it isn't all doom and gloom, that the reality might

126
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,440
 be that there's evidence around us that would suggest a certain path, but there is always

127
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
 hope.

128
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,120
 If it should be anyone, shouldn't it be the church at Christmas?

129
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,560
 So why is our voice silent?

130
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,080
 I think our voice is largely silent because if you're anything like me, along the way

131
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,020
 you've been burnt by hope.

132
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,960
 Maybe you come in today and just the very idea that I'm speaking on hope raises some

133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,000
 complex feelings for you.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,640
 Perhaps you're sitting in here right now and you've had a diagnosis this week, or something's

135
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,720
 happened in your family, or it's been challenging for you and you're facing what you're facing

136
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,800
 in an uncertain future and you're wrestling with that.

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,160
 Perhaps there's some of you, you put a lot of hope before in a changed relationship,

138
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,200
 but that relationship didn't seem to change.

139
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,960
 Or you put your hope in perhaps a debt to get paid off, but no matter how hard you've

140
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,160
 worked it hasn't seemed like you've been able to pay off that debt.

141
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,400
 Perhaps you put your hope in resolving a dispute that you've been having with a loved one,

142
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,400
 and no matter how hard you've tried it seems to get worse, not better.

143
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,080
 Perhaps for you, you've tried to lead some people to faith this year and they haven't

144
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
 given their lives to Jesus and you're wondering what that's all about.

145
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,160
 All of us perhaps have a story where we've put so much stock and faith into this thing

146
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,080
 called hope and it seems like it's flimsy, it's intangible.

147
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,640
 It doesn't seem like it's actually worked out for us and we've been so burnt by hope

148
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:16,160
 that even the idea of hope carries with it this pain in us and we're like, "What has

149
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,120
 hope ever done for me?"

150
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,440
 And perhaps because we're wrestling with that, the idea of having hope seems foreign to us

151
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,920
 and you're sitting there and you're saying to yourself, "I don't even think that it's

152
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:38,000
 worth me getting excited about something that seems so intangible."

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,920
 I think the reason why we Christians struggle with this, I want you to follow this, I think

154
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,840
 the reason why we Christians struggle with this is because there is this tension between

155
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,080
 the good idea of hope and our present reality or experience with it.

156
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,640
 And when those two things don't seem to add up a lot, it creates a bit of a tension within

157
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,720
 us.

158
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
 But I want to put it to you that the reason why these two things don't add up much for

159
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
 us as Christians, the good idea of hope and our present reality with it, is because I

160
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,760
 think as Christians, and I would say this boldly, I think as the global church, we've

161
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,600
 actually defined hope completely wrong.

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,160
 Let me tell you a little bit about how society, how the world defines hope and how hope is

163
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,640
 used mostly in an everyday context.

164
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,200
 So it would be something like this.

165
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,880
 Hope is an expressed, desired, positive outcome that is uncertain.

166
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,960
 Let me give you an example.

167
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,480
 My beautiful daughter Mia, who's 14 years old, she hopes that we will get her an iPad

168
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,520
 for Christmas.

169
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,360
 And what she really means by that is this.

170
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,240
 I hope that my mom and dad will dig into their bank account and buy me an iPad, but I have

171
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,080
 absolutely no certainty whether they will do that or not.

172
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,680
 It's just a hoped for, desired outcome that is uncertain.

173
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,400
 Are you following this?

174
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,080
 And my daughter is very smart because it is uncertain.

175
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,520
 Okay, I just want you to know that she's not in the service.

176
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,000
 That is a false hope, okay?

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,560
 Have you seen how expensive iPads are?

178
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
 That is not happening, all right?

179
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,800
 Don't tell her that if you see her later.

180
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,000
 It's not happening.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,520
 Or maybe you're sitting there and you're like, "I hope Pastor Andrew only preaches for 15

182
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,320
 minutes today."

183
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,560
 What you're really saying is, "I would prefer a short service today because I want to get

184
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,040
 out there into the bake sale as quickly as possible, and I hope that he's short, but

185
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,920
 actually I've been coming to the Vine for a while, and I know that he's not going to

186
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
 be short at all."

187
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,080
 So, it's weird.

188
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,800
 This hope that we use and we talk about so often, this is actually how we define it and

189
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 how we use it.

190
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,000
 In other words, hope is based in the reality that something is uncertain, but I hope that

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 it will work out.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,640
 I don't know if it will or not.

193
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,480
 The facts don't necessarily suggest it will or not, but I'm just going to kind of like

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,720
 throw a dart at a dart board and hope that I might get that 12 or triple 12 or whatever

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,840
 it is, hope that things will work out.

196
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
 I'm not sure.

197
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,940
 I'm not certain.

198
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,000
 It's a bit of a crack shoot, but we're going to see if this thing plays out okay.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,920
 And when it doesn't, darn it, I hoped again and it failed me.

200
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
 Are you with me, church?

201
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,600
 And because we have come to define hope within a Christian context in the same way that the

202
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:30,200
 world defines hope, it's not a surprise that the church has lost its voice.

203
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,080
 I think we actually ask this question mostly in church and it's this, "Why would I put

204
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:45,360
 my faith in something as flimsy, as uncertain, as doubtful as a thing like hope?"

205
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,000
 And because of that, here's what I've noticed.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,320
 Christians don't talk about hope.

207
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,760
 And we don't talk about hope because we don't want to set anybody up for failure because

208
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,200
 we've failed this way a lot and we don't want to push that on anyone else.

209
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,780
 So we downplay the reality of hope in church contexts.

210
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,400
 You got to understand that the Bible does not downplay hope.

211
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,700
 In fact, the Bible mentions hope over 600 times.

212
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,640
 It is mentioned in almost every single book in the Bible.

213
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,960
 When you get to the New Testament, the idea of hope is mentioned every two or three pages

214
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,040
 throughout the whole of the Old Testament.

215
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,440
 The Bible has a lot to say about hope, so why are we silent?

216
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,240
 I went to seminary for four years.

217
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,280
 I never did a class on hope.

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,760
 Faith got it nailed.

219
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,040
 Did lots of classes on faith.

220
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
 Love, oh my gosh, we talked about love all the time.

221
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,840
 We never once mentioned hope.

222
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,880
 In fact, the only time the word hope was mentioned in my seminary over four years was when the

223
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,160
 teacher was trying to call out the person whose first name was hope.

224
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,240
 That was the only time that I ever heard that word in seminary.

225
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,560
 We don't talk about hope because we've come to misunderstand it.

226
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,240
 We're defining it in a wrong way.

227
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,280
 And because we don't want to set anybody up to fail or into some uncertainty, we've kind

228
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,000
 of closed our mouth about it.

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
 But the Bible has so much to say.

230
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,840
 And the apostle Paul, who we're centering our Advent series in over these weeks, the

231
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,120
 apostle Paul has a lot to say about it.

232
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,280
 I kind of feel like he leans into his church and he says, "Look, guys, we might be talking

233
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,520
 about hope wrong, but if you can begin to understand how hope truly is, if you can begin

234
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,500
 to understand it in the way that it was designed to be, you would be the most hopeful people.

235
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,560
 And not only that, but you would actually begin to live a life of hope."

236
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,080
 He mentions it over 36 times in all of his letters.

237
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,280
 And I want to take you to a place where it's out of a book that perhaps you haven't read

238
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,240
 much, Titus.

239
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,680
 Paul is writing to one of his prodigies, this guy Titus, who's a church planter and a pastor

240
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,200
 in a small island, the island of Crete in the middle of the Mediterranean.

241
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,800
 And Paul writes to him to encourage him in the work he's doing, and he centers a conversation

242
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 on hope.

243
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,960
 I want to read this to you from Titus chapter two.

244
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
 Is this helping everyone?

245
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,160
 Are you okay?

246
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,360
 How are you feeling?

247
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 I'm a pastor.

248
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,400
 I can tell when you're lying.

249
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 Don't lie to me.

250
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
 All right.

251
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,960
 Here's Paul, Titus chapter two, verse 11.

252
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,160
 He says, "For the grace of God that has appeared has brought salvation to all people.

253
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,920
 It teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self-controlled,

254
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,280
 upright and godly lives in this present age while we wait for the blessed hope, the glorious

255
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,480
 appearing or the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ."

256
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,880
 It's really beautiful what Paul does here.

257
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,320
 Just in three little verses, I want to show you how he centers his conversation here around

258
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,360
 the now but not yet tension we've been talking about in the Advent series between the birth

259
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,280
 of Christ and the return of Christ.

260
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
 Notice what he first does.

261
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,840
 He splits this passage into three things, past, present and future.

262
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,240
 He does a lot of this in his letters.

263
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,560
 You'll notice he does this in three kind of immediate sentences a lot when he's writing.

264
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,440
 But I love the fact that he's saying there's something in the past, there's something in

265
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,560
 the present and there's something in the future.

266
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,680
 Not only that, but then he centers it in this Advent season that we're looking at.

267
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,080
 He says, "Look, there was this arrival, this appearance of Christ at the start."

268
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,440
 That's the first appearance, the first Advent.

269
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,000
 And then he says in the third verse, "He's coming again.

270
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,680
 There's this glory that will appear in the third time."

271
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,920
 And so he mentions these two bookends, the start and the finish, the birth and the return,

272
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,400
 just like Advent does.

273
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,600
 And he centers Titus in this thinking of God who is past, present and future, a God who

274
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,320
 has arrived, a God who is coming.

275
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,680
 And then in the middle he says this, "There is a blessed hope."

276
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,320
 I love how prickly the Apostle Paul is because he's speaking against that societal perspective

277
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,400
 that we all hold so dearly to us because so often we think hope is cursed.

278
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,520
 "Oh, I had this hope.

279
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,680
 I tried this hope.

280
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
 It didn't work out.

281
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
 It seemed like hope was cursed."

282
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,320
 Paul's saying, "You need to understand that hope is a bad rep.

283
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,140
 Actually hope is blessed."

284
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,600
 And here's why it's blessed, Paul is saying.

285
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:28,640
 "It's blessed because I am placing the object of my hope not in something that is uncertain."

286
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
 This is so powerful, church.

287
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,900
 He said, "You need to understand that this is a blessed hope because my hope is not based

288
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,960
 in some circumstance that's going to change or that I hope will change.

289
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,120
 Equally, it's not based in some emotion that I'm feeling.

290
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,280
 I'm going to feel more positive about the future or something like that.

291
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,160
 It's not based in my strength and my ability."

292
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,400
 He's saying, "The object of my hope, the reason why it's blessed is because I'm placing it

293
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,040
 in something that is certain, something that you can take to the bank.

294
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,080
 If I place it in my circumstances, situations, there is a problem."

295
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
 He writes to the church in Colossae this a little bit differently.

296
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,640
 He says, "Look, I know what it is to be hungry.

297
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,320
 I know what it is to be well fed.

298
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,680
 I know what it is to have a lot of money.

299
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 I know what it is to have none.

300
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
 I know what it is to be shipwrecked.

301
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,640
 I know what it is to be safe."

302
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,200
 He goes, "I have experienced all the different things you can experience in life."

303
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,120
 In other words, my circumstances go up and down just like yours do, but I've learned

304
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,280
 to be content in every circumstance.

305
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,000
 That contentness is his blessed hope.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,560
 And he's saying, "This blessed hope is rooted in the beautiful idea that I'm putting my

307
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,180
 trust in the one who is completely unchangeable.

308
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,280
 My daughter Mia has made a mistake because she has placed her hope in Chris and I's bank

309
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,400
 account."

310
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
 That is a very bad place to put your hope.

311
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
 I'm just letting you know.

312
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,440
 And Paul's not making that mistake.

313
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,000
 He's not, "I'm not placing my hope in some arbitrary thing that is uncertain.

314
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 No, no.

315
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I'm going to place my hope in the very thing that is certain in this God who loves us,

316
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,200
 this Christ who has come and is coming again.

317
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,400
 That's where I'm placing."

318
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,060
 And it's a blessed hope when you find hope in the thing that is unchangeable.

319
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,720
 When you find things, place your hope in the thing that never will fail you, never give

320
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 up on you.

321
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,840
 It doesn't mean that you won't sometimes be shipwrecked, but it will mean that you will

322
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,040
 be content in whatever circumstance you find.

323
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:27,120
 Oh, could you imagine the voice of a church that's content when economic disparity is

324
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,320
 there, when the church is content even though there is all this stuff going on.

325
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,600
 And not content because it's just going like, "I don't really care about that stuff out

326
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,840
 there," content in saying, "This is our opportunity to rise up and say there is a hope no matter

327
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,040
 how dangerous, how hard, how painful, how broken the world might seem around us right

328
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
 now.

329
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,360
 There is another story."

330
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,800
 Not a cursed hope, but a blessed one.

331
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 You see, this is biblical hope.

332
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,760
 Hope is not in us.

333
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,280
 It's not in some change in circumstance.

334
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,320
 It's not in some positive thinking.

335
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,080
 It's not in some logical certainties.

336
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:18,240
 Our hope is only ever in an unchanging, all-loving, all-purposeful God who has spoken truth and

337
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,720
 cannot do anything other than speak truth.

338
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,020
 That my friends is where our hope is.

339
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,240
 And when we place our hope in that, we begin to find a blessed hope, not a cursed one,

340
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,300
 not one that lets us down, not one that kind of, yeah, sure, not one that always does everything

341
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,240
 we ever want it to do.

342
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,520
 God is not Santa Claus, but a God that we can take to the bank and say, "This is our

343
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,800
 blessed hope."

344
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,420
 Now notice what he does here too.

345
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,580
 This is really important, church.

346
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,360
 He places the idea of a blessed hope in the idea of the birth of Christ and the return

347
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
 of Christ.

348
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 Here's why that's important.

349
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,480
 He says something about the birth of Christ, first of all, in verse 11.

350
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,280
 He says, "For the grace of God has appeared to us."

351
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,800
 This is so important.

352
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:11,120
 What he's saying is our blessed hope is actually founded on a foundation, a cornerstone, like

353
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,680
 we're just saying, of grace.

354
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,160
 In other words, our roots of our hope is in the story of grace.

355
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,200
 God chose to come to this world, not leave us in our pain, in our brokenness, in our

356
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 sin.

357
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
 He decided to step in and change everything.

358
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,720
 He decided to bring his son, Emmanuel, God with us, to grow up and inaugurate the kingdom

359
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
 of God.

360
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,160
 And in that, through his life, death, and resurrection, change the story of sin and

361
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,880
 brokenness in our lives and make us into a new creation, one who now holds a different

362
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
 narrative.

363
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
 And why?

364
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
 Because of grace.

365
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
 We haven't earned it.

366
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
 We don't deserve it.

367
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,200
 It's not because we've done something right.

368
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,400
 It's not because we try to be good people.

369
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,520
 He did it whilst we were still sinners, died for us.

370
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,640
 And because of that, we are all caught up in a story of grace.

371
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,440
 If you ever wanted hope, it's found in the fact that you've been called by grace.

372
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,120
 That's his starting point.

373
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,320
 The grace has appeared to us.

374
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,660
 But he doesn't stop there.

375
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,720
 He then uses a different word.

376
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,880
 He says, "And glory is coming to us."

377
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,240
 Christ is returning, and when he returns, he returns in the glory of him.

378
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,160
 The glory of his salvation is completed as he returns.

379
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,560
 Your story is not just founded in this wonderful grace of this birth and life and death and

380
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,840
 resurrection of Jesus, as good as that is.

381
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,160
 Your hope, your blessed hope, is also found that your future, no matter how dim it might

382
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,960
 appear right now, no matter how hard it might appear, no matter what uncertainties might

383
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,120
 still sit upon you, your future is guaranteed.

384
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,840
 If you love Jesus, if he is part of your life, if he is in your heart, you only have glory

385
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
 ahead of you.

386
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,400
 And yes, death will still be a part of all of our stories, but there's a bigger story

387
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,680
 than the story of death.

388
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,120
 It's the story of life.

389
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,880
 And that story is returning, and when it returns, there will be everyone who ever believed in

390
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,160
 him raised up to be embraced in his loving hands.

391
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,360
 Paul is saying, "You want to know where your hope is?

392
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,280
 Yes, it's in grace, but it is also in glory.

393
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,080
 And the one who came to you in grace is coming back to you in glory."

394
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,720
 And so Paul wants to communicate to the church that biblical hope has two directions to it.

395
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,800
 It looks back in gratitude for the grace that has appeared in Christ Jesus in that first

396
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,680
 coming that has brought and kind of moved us, purchased us in the redemption.

397
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:43,240
 But our hope also looks forward to the return of Christ in his glory, and we look forward

398
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,400
 with expectation for that, where he will complete our redemption.

399
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,640
 So these two things, the purchasing of our redemption through grace and the completion

400
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,520
 of that redemption when he comes back is a part of the human story.

401
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,480
 And because it is, we now have hope.

402
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,400
 Grace has defined me.

403
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,360
 Glory will define me.

404
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,480
 And right in this moment, I am blessed.

405
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,080
 Oh, not everything's going my way.

406
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,880
 Not all my circumstances seem to be how I want them.

407
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,840
 Could I do with some more money to buy an iPad?

408
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,680
 I could.

409
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,920
 Could I not have this diagnosis of this medical condition?

410
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,480
 That would be helpful.

411
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,680
 Is my life as perfect as I'd want it to be?

412
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,680
 No.

413
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,120
 Does that remove for one moment the blessed hope that I have in a God who has come and

414
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,400
 a God who is returning?

415
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,240
 And even though my circumstances may not tell the world right now that I'm filled and perfect

416
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,040
 and great, what my circumstances can do in the brokenness, in the hardship, in the suffering,

417
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,840
 the fact that I still have hope, that becomes a light that is shone in the darkness.

418
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,680
 And my colleagues around me are saying, "You've just been diagnosed with cancer, but you're

419
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,160
 laughing?

420
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,720
 Why could you ever be positive with your life?

421
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,800
 I see your life.

422
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,680
 Your life is terrible.

423
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
 You believe in Jesus.

424
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,720
 Your life is terrible.

425
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
 Why is that the case?

426
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,480
 I still have hope."

427
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,600
 Yeah, situations may not be as I want them, but guess what?

428
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,880
 My circumstances do not define my hope.

429
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,320
 My hope is not in the uncertainties of life.

430
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:31,240
 My hope is in the blessed arrival and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.

431
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,760
 Now it's not only Paul in the New Testament that writes this kind of beautiful picture

432
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,080
 of where hope is based between the coming and the return.

433
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,920
 In fact, I want to take you real quickly just out of Paul into Peter.

434
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,080
 I want to just read this to you from 1 Peter.

435
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,520
 This is Peter writing in 1 Peter verse 3.

436
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,320
 He says this, "Praise be to the God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for in his

437
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,240
 great mercy he has given us," note this, "new birth into," what?

438
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,880
 All right, we're going to try that again.

439
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,680
 You're suddenly in Sunday school.

440
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,680
 Happy?

441
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,400
 All right, follow along with me.

442
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,840
 In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a?

443
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,800
 One more time.

444
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,560
 He has given us new birth into a?

445
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,280
 Through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.

446
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,680
 Notice this, "into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, or fade, kept in heaven

447
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,480
 for you, who through faith are being shielded by God's power until the coming salvation

448
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,640
 that is ready to be revealed in the last time."

449
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,240
 Peter goes, "He has come, Jesus Christ, and he has gone to the cross, and he's been raised

450
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
 from the dead."

451
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
 And guess what?

452
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,820
 You now have received a new birth.

453
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,820
 If your relationship is him, you have a new birth in him.

454
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,880
 You are a, he calls it, "living hope."

455
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,280
 There is a blessed living hope inside of you as you now long for the inheritance that has

456
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,840
 been purchased for you in the cross, the return of Christ who makes all things well.

457
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,840
 Can you see how Peter and Paul are saying the same kind of thing?

458
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,400
 In fact, let me put these two side by side so you can see this a little bit clearer.

459
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,960
 Here's the living hope that Peter is talking about.

460
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,580
 In other words, hope is not just based in the past.

461
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,840
 It's not just based in the future.

462
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,320
 Hope is present today.

463
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,560
 This is really important because otherwise we might think that Paul and Peter are just

464
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,640
 saying, "Hey, you've had hope before.

465
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,000
 You're going to have it later.

466
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,160
 Right now you just need to suffer."

467
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,720
 It's not what he's saying.

468
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,760
 He's saying because there's hope in the past, because there's hope in the future, you're

469
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,800
 rooted right now in a living hope, a blessed hope.

470
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,040
 In other words, that hope should shape who you are today.

471
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,600
 I love how Paul writes it.

472
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,800
 If you look at the Titus passage, he goes, "It teaches us," this blessed hope, "to say

473
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,120
 no to ungodliness and worldly passions, to live self-controlled and upright godly lives

474
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,080
 in this present age, in the now but not yet, in the place where we don't have all the answers

475
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,120
 and we don't know how everything's going to work out.

476
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,200
 Right now, when the world is in despair," and it seems like the church is a little bit

477
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,640
 too much in despair too.

478
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,680
 No, right now, blessed hope, based in the past, planned for the future, has an impact

479
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,800
 in who I am today so I can say no.

480
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,840
 I can resist exploitation.

481
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,520
 I can resist empire.

482
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,600
 I can resist the things that are unjust in this world.

483
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,320
 No, I can resist the ungodly passions that rise up in me.

484
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,120
 So I can say yes to the kingdom that is coming and my life can be a picture of what that

485
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,360
 kingdom looks like today.

486
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,680
 That's hope.

487
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:34,080
 That is a hope that could set a church on fire.

488
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:42,160
 Now I want you to see that this kind of biblical hope is not like societal hope at all.

489
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,360
 I mean this is not whimsical thinking.

490
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,840
 This is not positive, the power of positive thinking.

491
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,920
 This is not throwing a dart at a dartboard and hoping it gets a good number.

492
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,000
 This is also not naive hope.

493
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,520
 It's really important you see this.

494
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,120
 See biblical hope is not naive.

495
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,360
 It's not trying to pull the wool over our eyes.

496
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,400
 It's not trying to help us to ignore the bad things that we're seeing around us.

497
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,240
 Biblical hope is not this sort of like, "Oh yeah, we're just going to be in a holy huddle

498
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,600
 in a church and kind of ignore all the stuff out there and we're just going to sing our

499
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,440
 love songs until Jesus comes back."

500
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,400
 That's not what we're being called to here.

501
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,300
 See biblical hope is not naive.

502
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,640
 It's not trying to turn a blind eye.

503
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,960
 Biblical hope is actually rooted in the very grittiness of the human condition.

504
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,480
 This is why we have the laments in the Bible, giving us a place to bring our pain, a place

505
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,760
 to bring the circumstances that don't seem right.

506
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,680
 If you're here today and there's something big and heavy on your life, you have an opportunity

507
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,160
 through lament to bring the challenges of life.

508
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,440
 Biblical hope doesn't ignore the pain and the difficulties and the circumstances around

509
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
 us.

510
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,240
 It helps us to see something else.

511
00:29:51,240 --> 00:30:00,740
 It lifts us up above it so that we're able to, even in the midst of that story, proclaim

512
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,100
 another one.

513
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,680
 So I want you to see the practical power of what Paul's teaching here.

514
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,760
 Your hope is rooted in the past, in this story of grace.

515
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,680
 That means if you are here today and you are carrying around baggage in your heart, in

516
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,640
 your soul, maybe there was something that has happened in your life in the past and

517
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,360
 you still haven't been able to get over it today.

518
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,880
 Maybe there's a challenge that took place.

519
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,260
 Maybe you went through a nasty divorce.

520
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,000
 Maybe you made some mistakes.

521
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,920
 Maybe you lost a lot of money.

522
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,540
 Maybe you got into some sin and you're embarrassed about it and you regret it.

523
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,400
 Maybe you said some things you didn't mean to say.

524
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,520
 Maybe somebody did something to you that was unfair, unjust, hurt you.

525
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,760
 Maybe there's a trauma you've gone through.

526
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,640
 Here's where the hope lies.

527
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,360
 The hope lies that God understands all of that and invites you into a place of grace.

528
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,760
 That you can be released from all of your sin through the forgiveness of the Lord.

529
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,240
 That you can find healing and restoration for the trauma through the forgiveness and

530
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,280
 the grace of the Lord.

531
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,580
 Where grace comes to us is a beautiful gift.

532
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
 We have hope.

533
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:19,400
 None of you in this room have to allow the past to be the primary paradigm that defines

534
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,520
 your future.

535
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,960
 Because you have grace.

536
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,880
 That's hope.

537
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,040
 But not just grace there.

538
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,980
 You've got grace for your future.

539
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,860
 Despite that diagnosis that's come recently or the fact that you've lost your job this

540
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,320
 year and you haven't been able to find one yet or whatever it might be and you look to

541
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,720
 your future and you think, "Man, I don't know what's ahead.

542
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
 I don't know if I'm going to be able to provide for my family.

543
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
 I don't know if everything's going to work out.

544
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,640
 My investment portfolio seems to be in a bad spot."

545
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,880
 Whatever it is, you look into the future and you think, "This looks pretty grim."

546
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,680
 And God says, "No, you've got hope for your future."

547
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,740
 Because it's not based in the circumstances of your life.

548
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,880
 It's based in the glory of a God who will return.

549
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,800
 And when He returns, the whole story of life gets its completion.

550
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,160
 Gets set alight by His goodness.

551
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,320
 That every tribe and tongue will gather around and sing His praise.

552
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,720
 That sin is dealt with forever.

553
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,940
 Death is no more.

554
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,480
 That we have the eternal life and the love of the embracing arms of a Father.

555
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,000
 That is your future guaranteed if you believe in Jesus.

556
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,920
 And you have hope for now.

557
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,400
 Hope in the present.

558
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:34,220
 Because those two things should give you such confidence and assurance today that yes, even

559
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:39,800
 though circumstances may be still hard, you can hold your head up and say, "This story

560
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:46,960
 that I am facing right now is not the main story of my life."

561
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
 This my friends, is actually all the story of Christmas.

562
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,400
 I don't know if you've ever thought of Christmas this way, but Christmas is this pretty rough

563
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,320
 and raw story.

564
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,520
 If we strip all of the celebration stuff out of it, all the trees and the gifts and all

565
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,960
 of that, and actually just look at Christmas as it's presented to us in Scripture, you'll

566
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,080
 see a situation that's pretty bleak.

567
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,400
 I mean, essentially, Christmas is a story of a teenage crisis pregnancy.

568
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,360
 Of this girl who is impregnated by the Spirit of God, who is pledged to be married but is

569
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
 not yet married.

570
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,040
 And in those days, that's just as bad as in these days.

571
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,280
 In fact, probably in those days, even worse.

572
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,120
 And the shame that comes upon her because she's suddenly pregnant and beginning to show

573
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,440
 that she's pregnant.

574
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,600
 And everybody around her is beginning to say, "Oh, her and Joseph.

575
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
 I told you.

576
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,000
 I told you they were a bit friendly at that party the other week."

577
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,240
 And they're having to live in the indignity and the shame of the reality of this all happening

578
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,380
 to them, even though it's not their fault.

579
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,540
 Not only that, but her fiancé is a working class man who works hard, but he works hard

580
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:55,200
 in a small town, in a small country that is absorbed by this powerful empire that does

581
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,960
 not have their best interests at heart.

582
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,280
 And from there, they're then forced in the indignity of her pregnancy to have to move

583
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,680
 from their town down to the fiancé's relative's town.

584
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,960
 This place called Bethlehem.

585
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,640
 And when they get there, here's what they're hoping for.

586
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,720
 Here's what they're thinking.

587
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,640
 When we get there, as heavily pregnant as Mary is, that the families that are related

588
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,360
 to her fiancé are going to open their homes and welcome them in.

589
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,380
 But that does not happen.

590
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,880
 They get there, and the relatives are so embarrassed by this crisis pregnancy of this teenager

591
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,760
 who's not married that they can't welcome that shame into their houses.

592
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,880
 So they keep their doors shut.

593
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,320
 And although we hear the story, "Oh, there was no room in the inn," and we make like

594
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,520
 a lovely hallmark postcard out of it, the reality is the reason why Mary and Joseph

595
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:47,080
 gave birth to Jesus in a stall in an animal shelter was because none of the family welcomed

596
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,640
 them in.

597
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,240
 And so they give birth, she gives birth to this child literally in a dark, damp cave.

598
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,700
 These were not pretty mangers.

599
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,080
 They were caves under the houses where the animals were, and they were under the house

600
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,120
 to provide them warmth in the wintertime.

601
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,080
 So they were in that place of darkness, of dampness, a child is born.

602
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,920
 This is not the place this mother wanted the child to be born.

603
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,840
 But she has this thought that her child is special, that actually the location of his

604
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,980
 birth does not determine his future.

605
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,600
 And in the Christmas story, we see a theme arise.

606
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,880
 It's an audacious theme, and it's this, that even though things might look bleak right

607
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,840
 now, even though the bad guys are in power, even though it seems that the winners are

608
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,200
 lording it over the losers, even though it doesn't seem like things are going to change,

609
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,360
 nothing is permanent.

610
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,280
 That God is able to step into the brokenness and the darkness and bring his literal son

611
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,580
 into that situation.

612
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:53,640
 And when his son comes, we have Emmanuel, God with us, who would grow up and inaugurate

613
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,240
 the kingdom, who would actually begin to tell people that the first will be last and the

614
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,840
 last will be first, who begins to teach that the lowly will be lifted up and that the hungry

615
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,160
 will be fed, who begins to paint a picture of a coming kingdom where those who are mighty

616
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,080
 will be cast down from their thrones and the proud will be scattered in their uttermost

617
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
 thoughts.

618
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,560
 He begins to speak of a time where the meek will inherit the earth, not those with power

619
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
 and guns.

620
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,480
 He begins to speak of the idea that wouldn't it be great to actually see those who are

621
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,240
 mourning right now be comforted.

622
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,740
 This is hope.

623
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,000
 And this is hope because what he's essentially saying is, I want you to have confident assurance

624
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,900
 that this vision of the coming kingdom, you can live on behalf of that vision now.

625
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,880
 This is hope that despite how hard the world might be and despite how strong the narrative

626
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,240
 of destruction and suffering might be, no, we get the opportunity to bear witness today

627
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,480
 in the midst of all of that suffering to the power of God to save people, to bring justice,

628
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,800
 to liberate and to heal the broken.

629
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,280
 That we as the church get to actually say that within the story of death, there is a

630
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,960
 better story, a brighter story, a more hopeful story.

631
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,040
 And it's the story of life that we might join with Martin Luther King Jr. and say, "Hey,

632
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,640
 we're going to take a little stone of hope out of the mountain of despair."

633
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,320
 That is hope, my friends.

634
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:34,360
 Could you imagine a church who gave voice to that kind of hope?

635
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
 Here's what it would do.

636
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:42,000
 I think if a church really believed in that kind of hope, here's what I think would happen.

637
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,560
 I think we would find ourselves with a divinely inspired urgency to live like Jesus.

638
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,600
 I think we would really hunger and thirst for righteousness.

639
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:02,000
 I think actually we would move away from our passive comfort towards costly solidarity

640
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,720
 with the poor and the broken and the vulnerable.

641
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,240
 I think here's what that church would do.

642
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,600
 I think a church with that kind of hope would actually begin to say that no matter what

643
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,880
 might come before us, no matter how hard things might get, no matter what persecution might

644
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,880
 come, we can persevere because we're not persevering in our own strength.

645
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,360
 We're persevering in the power of the Holy Spirit that has come upon us.

646
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,960
 You know, those that hope in the Lord, they renew their strength.

647
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,720
 It's like they get wings like eagles and they can soar again.

648
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,760
 They can run and not get tired.

649
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,440
 That's kind of what happens to a church when it has this kind of hope.

650
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,280
 I think a church with this kind of hope, here's how I think they live.

651
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,280
 No matter how difficult it might be because people are saying things about them, are saying

652
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,480
 things about their God, are saying that there's hypocrisy there, who are slandering the church.

653
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,480
 These people within the church rise up and say no matter how hard the narrative against

654
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,920
 us might be, we will not falter.

655
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,680
 We will not fall because our hope is not in ourselves, but it's in this unchanging God

656
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,100
 who has come, is coming, and will come again.

657
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,800
 This kind of church is one that says, "Hey, we may be hard pressed on every side, but

658
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,500
 we are not crushed.

659
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,600
 We might be perplexed at times, but we are not in despair."

660
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,880
 That kind of church says, "We might be knocked down, but we are not destroyed, persecuted,

661
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,480
 but we are not abandoned."

662
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,000
 That is hope.

663
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 I think this kind of church will also do this.

664
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,760
 I think they will re-imagine the world as it is right now to be the world that is coming

665
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,840
 when Christ returns.

666
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,800
 I think they'll realize that they can't make the world perfect right now until Jesus comes

667
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,700
 back, but they are going to live on behalf of that story.

668
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,340
 I think they're the kind of church that begins to go, "Hey, this is the thing that really

669
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,640
 matters that we begin to look at what is being exploited.

670
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,220
 Look at what's coming in division.

671
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,920
 Look at what's coming through hatred.

672
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,680
 Look at what's coming through injustice.

673
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,920
 Look at what's coming through power play that is taking place.

674
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,280
 Look at the growth of empire.

675
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,640
 Look at all of these things and say there's actually another way to live, one in which

676
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,440
 turns everything upside down and gives us a root in the wonder and the glory of the

677
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,360
 one who is not us.

678
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:32,720
 The one who's forgiven us with grace is returning with glory and has birthed a living hope."

679
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,560
 I think that's Christmas.

680
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,280
 I think that's what the season of Advent invites us into.

681
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,400
 And I think that's how you need to redefine your thinking around hope, away from a positive

682
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,800
 desired outcome that seems uncertain to a blessed hope that has something to say to

683
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,080
 the brokenness of this world.

684
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,480
 So let me give you some homework like I've been doing each week to help you to process

685
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,000
 this in your own time.

686
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,640
 Take a photo of this slide that's coming up.

687
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,660
 Let me read these to you in general.

688
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,340
 Would you describe yourself as a hopeful person or not?

689
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,160
 Why or why not?

690
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,040
 Where currently in your life have you lost hope?

691
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,280
 Why do you think this is the case?

692
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,860
 Biblical hope is rooted in both grace and glory.

693
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,120
 Which of these might be lacking more in your understanding of hope?

694
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,640
 And then finally, biblical hope is not only future focused but a living hope that invites

695
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,240
 us to bear witness to God's kingdom in the here and now.

696
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,480
 So where do you sense the Holy Spirit is inviting you to do this in your life and what might

697
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,920
 that look like?

698
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,760
 One thing I want to say is this, Paul writes in Romans 15 verse 13 something so beautiful.

699
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:47,440
 He says this, he says, "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust

700
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,240
 in Him so that you might overflow with hope through the power of the Holy Spirit."

701
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:58,360
 If there's ever a prayer for Christmas for the Vine, that's my prayer.

702
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
 Can we pray together?

703
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
 Let's do that.

704
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,760
 Father, I thank you for every person here.

705
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,800
 I thank you for their stories.

706
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,520
 I thank you for the life that they have lived and the life that they are living.

707
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,160
 I thank you Lord that no matter how difficult things have been and no matter how difficult

708
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,240
 things are right now, that biblical hope is not some whimsical positive thinking.

709
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,020
 It's not throwing a dart at a dartboard.

710
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,180
 We are rooted in a blessed hope.

711
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:33,220
 One that may not suddenly magically change our circumstances but will change us.

712
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,600
 Change our attitude and our heart and our thinking.

713
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:43,400
 Bring life and new birth into us so that we can begin to live out the very thing that

714
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,040
 you've called us to live.

715
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,560
 Lord, we are in a hope crisis in our world right now.

716
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,560
 Father, would you bring a voice of hope to your church, Lord?

717
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,840
 Lord, I pray that each person here on their individual level, a family level, would begin

718
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:06,000
 to become living hope in their families, their workplaces, their schools, the places of their

719
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,840
 influence, Lord.

720
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,080
 I pray that even this week out of their mouths would not share the conversation of despair

721
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
 and gloom.

722
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,860
 Not that we ignore it, no, because biblical hope is not naive.

723
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,240
 Not that we try to ignore the realities of what's happening around us, but no, offer

724
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,120
 people a different narrative even within it, even recognizing it.

725
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,560
 Lord, that's hope.

726
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:36,400
 So, Father, as you, as Paul so beautifully said to his church, I say over this, that

727
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,160
 may the God of hope birth in these people joy and peace right now in the name of Jesus.

728
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:47,840
 Where they've come in with pain and hurt and suffering, I want to pray for joy and peace,

729
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,140
 the markers of the Christmas story.

730
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,240
 As we trust in you, Lord, Lord, for those in this room where their trust is weak, for

731
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,480
 those watching online where the trust is weak right now, Lord, I pray that like we talked

732
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,540
 about last week, that our faith would rise in us in this season and that you would help

733
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,920
 us to overflow with hope.

734
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,320
 Oh, Lord, I want to pray for an overflow of hope in every family, every story, every sphere

735
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,440
 of influence, Lord.

736
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,360
 I want to pray that these people in this room would annoy the people around them with hope.

737
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,080
 And as Paul says, an overflow of hope through the release of the Holy Spirit.

738
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,440
 So I pray right now for the release of the Holy Spirit.

739
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,680
 Come Lord, and minister to these people in the depths of your spirit, and I pray you

740
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,520
 would rise up a living hope in them, Lord.

741
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,240
 Whatever is happening in your story right now is not the full stop.

742
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,200
 Jesus is the comer in that sentence.

743
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,240
 There is more to be written.

744
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,880
 There is more ahead.

745
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,840
 What you think is an end is not an end, and may hope overflow in you through the power

746
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,600
 of the Holy Spirit.

747
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,200
 Just allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you now.

748
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,120
 Just let his gentle whisper be with you.

749
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,240
 And our choir are going to sing over you, but just allow them to sing over you in this

750
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,240
 moment.

751
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,760
 Just keep your eyes closed, your heads bowed.

752
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,280
 Listen to the words that they sing.

753
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,720
 May this be a ministry to whatever hopelessness may be upon you.

754
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,880
 May this call you to living hope.

755
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,460
 (gentle music)
