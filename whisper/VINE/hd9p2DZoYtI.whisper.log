[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   So, about six months into being senior pastor here at The Vine in 2013, I had what could
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.360]   only be described as a full on panic attack.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.720]   I woke up one morning and immediately as I opened my eyes, it felt like a tsunami of
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.000]   fear and of anxiety was just flooding over me.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.920]   I was lying there in bed and the whole room around me was just beginning to spin.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.240]   I was so hot.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.720]   My heart rate was pounding and I was sweating all over despite the fact that the air con
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.160]   in our room was just blasting out.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.680]   I felt completely out of control.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.080]   I wondered whether I was going to be able to catch a breath and what was going to happen.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.640]   I managed to just get out of my bed and literally just stumbled towards the bathroom, whereupon
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.280]   I kind of opened up the toilet and I was sick in the toilet.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.960]   I threw up literally in the toilet.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.080]   In that moment, I felt like this overwhelming sense of fear, almost to a degree like paranoia,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.040]   like everything that I was trusting, everything that I was hoping in, everything seemed to
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.240]   be shattered in that moment.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.640]   I didn't know what was going on.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680]   I didn't know how to find my feet again, how to find that ground again.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.040]   I was there on the bathroom floor.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.520]   I began to understand what was taking place.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.940]   This panic attack wasn't just a random thing, but it was the result of so many months of
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.600]   bottling up how I was feeling.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.880]   I realized that this was connected to my role as senior pastor here at the Vine.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.360]   I had been struggling for months up until that point with a huge amount of self-doubt
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.520]   in my life, a huge amount of anxiety, self-doubt, and insecurity in who I was.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.120]   I knew that God had called me to be senior pastor here at the church.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.440]   I had been so wonderfully prepared by our elders, by John and Tony, our founding senior
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   pastors here.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.600]   I was ready on paper to step into this role.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.280]   When I stepped in on that day in November 2013, I had all those prayers, just like we
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.160]   prayed for Elizabeth just a minute ago.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.880]   I felt this wave of just God's Spirit in me.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.000]   But it's so fascinating how quickly that was drained from me as I began to focus on my
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.840]   lack or my inability to do the thing that God had called me to do.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.000]   I was putting so much of my energy in those few months to pretending on the surface in
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.920]   front of everybody, standing in front of you every week that I'm this great pastor, that
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.880]   I've got it all together, that everything's going to be great.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.280]   Whereas inside, I was dying.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.080]   Inside I thought I was a failure.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.320]   Here was the main thought that went through my head in that first six months.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.160]   John and Tony had done such an amazing job of building such a strong, well-established,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160]   great church.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.360]   And here I was now with that whole church on my shoulders, all that expectations and
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.760]   all that pressures.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   And I thought, "What if I'm the guy who 12 months down the line, the church goes from
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.560]   the size it is and it reduces down to like a hundred or so people?
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.960]   What if I'm the one who actually fails in leading this church?
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.000]   They've done such a great job and now it's on my shoulders."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.920]   And I felt like I wasn't up to the task.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.840]   And that wave of tension in me between living two different lives, a secret life of anxiety
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.120]   and insecurity that no one knew about, and a public persona that I had everything all
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.600]   right and that I was doing fine and that I could lead this church.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.560]   Those two things created in me such a tension that on that morning, it just exploded in
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   me.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.160]   Well, for the next number of days and the weeks ahead, I found myself thinking to myself,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.780]   if people spend enough time with me, they'll realize that I'm completely out of my depth.
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.680]   And so what that made me do was begin to slowly at first and then quickly withdraw myself
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   from people.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.120]   I began in my trauma of the insecurity and anxiety that I was feeling to step away from
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.200]   people, kind of wall myself off.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.440]   I thought if I can just create my own little private sense of some false sense of security
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.720]   and comfort by walling others away from me, maybe I can get control again.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.160]   And so I began to distance myself from close relationships that had a strain on my marriage.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.840]   I began to distance myself from people that I was supposed to be ministering to, from
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.200]   social settings.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.120]   I didn't want to spend time with people because I thought if people would spend time with
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.440]   me, they would actually know that I am the failure, that I am the one that I thought
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.840]   deep down inside I was.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.800]   And I was carrying that tension with me, isolating myself from my community, and it eventually
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.000]   just kind of boiled over.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.600]   There was one evening where the tension was so strong that I was like, I have to tell
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   my wife, Chris.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   Like, I have to let her in to this pain.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.680]   I can't carry the pressure anymore.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.000]   I took her out on a date night.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.480]   It wasn't the kind of date nights that normally you would expect.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.760]   I took her out for this meal and we sat down.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.760]   And it was this public restaurant.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.480]   And as soon as we sat down, I just started to weep.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.040]   You know those moments where you don't plan to cry, but you suddenly just start weeping
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   in this public space?
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.920]   And I'm just, I'm like a grown man weeping.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.280]   And I can't control myself.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.720]   And Chris is sitting there kind of going, "What is going on?"
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.680]   And I got the courage to say to her, "Honey, I'm really suffering right now.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.440]   I'm sinking in the pressure of leading this church.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.600]   I don't think I can do it.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.160]   I don't think I've got the strength or the skills.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.880]   I don't think I'm a very good pastor."
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.600]   I began to give her a list of all the things.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.480]   And the biggest thing that was scaring me was that if I failed, everybody would leave
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.200]   and desert me.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:40.920]   And I said to her, I said, "Honey, if I fail with leading the vine, if the church dies
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.280]   and disintegrates under my leadership, will you still love me?"
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.800]   That was how insecure I was.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.000]   I thought that her love for me was based on my success and my achievements.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.360]   And Chris, in the beautiful way that only she can, leant forward, put her hand on my
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   hands.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.920]   And she says, "No matter what happens in your life, Andrew, whether you have great success
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.600]   or great failure, I will never stop loving you."
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280]   And then she said, "But you cannot do this alone.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.400]   You cannot do it in isolation from others.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.360]   The thing you actually need the most is the thing that you're walking away from, that
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.400]   you need to come out and be known.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.720]   You need to let people know how you're feeling.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.640]   The church will support you.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.880]   We're here for you.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.080]   And that half of what you think is going to happen is not going to happen anyway."
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.040]   She started to comfort me with a challenge to not isolate, but to embrace the people
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.040]   around me.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.240]   Well, that evening was a turning point for me.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.760]   And I've been on a journey of healing ever since.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.960]   It's seven years in.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.280]   I think I'm still on that journey of healing, although I've learned so much and I've grown
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   so much.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   And you may wonder, one of the things that I think I'm known for in leadership is my
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.520]   authenticity and my vulnerability.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.200]   That's not come just because I've tried to do it.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.480]   It's come because I've had to reach deep inside of me and be courageous in being known in
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.480]   front of you.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.280]   I realized that I cannot carry the burdens of this ministry on my own.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.360]   And so I bring them to you regularly as a church, as a way of me saying, "I will not
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.200]   isolate myself."
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.660]   That actually I think it's in community.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.040]   It's when we're courageous enough to truly be known in our brokenness and our hurt and
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.080]   all the things that we're struggling with, that we actually can find the greatest moments
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.400]   of our healing.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.880]   Some of you watching this right now, you've isolated yourselves from people around you.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.680]   You've walled yourself off thinking that that's the place to find your comfort and security.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.480]   And I want to speak a message to you today.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.940]   If that's you, because it's been me and it still is me at some times, if that resonates
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:52.880]   with you, I want to call you once again into a place of being known by the people around
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.160]   you.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.320]   Ask any psychologist, ask any sociologist, anthropologist, they'll tell you the same
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   thing.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.820]   They'll say that no one ever grows, transforms, changes, or develops for the positive in isolation
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.820]   from others.
[00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.520]   In fact, like I experienced in my own life, the opposite is true.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.680]   Some of the greatest moments of breakdown in our physiology and our psychology happens
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.320]   because we isolate ourselves from a community around us.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.680]   If you're willing to put yourself into a place where you're open and vulnerable with people,
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.600]   where you can truly be known by them, where you can grow in the safety and security of
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.640]   their friendship and love, some of the greatest moments of growth and flourishing will happen
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.920]   to you.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.760]   But cut those things away.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.160]   Wall yourself off.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.000]   Retreat because maybe you're embarrassed or ashamed, or maybe something's happening and
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.360]   trauma in your life to such a degree that it makes you shut down.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.200]   Do that and you'll find yourselves moving in the opposite direction of growth, change,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.360]   and transformation.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   Here's the great irony of trauma.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.680]   Trauma does its very best to remove, to kind of take away community from you.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.920]   And the tension and irony is this.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.960]   When you need community the most is when you actually feel like you desire it the least.
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.600]   When we're so overwhelmed with trauma, when we're so overwhelmed by the pressures of life,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.960]   that's when we actually need to reach out towards others.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.680]   But it's the time where we desire it the least.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.440]   We want to walk in the opposite way.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.680]   I think this is one of the greatest strategies of the enemy over us.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.120]   We isolate ourselves when times are tough.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.760]   I think over 2020, we all did this to a certain degree.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.120]   Look, we all had to physically distance each other.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.240]   And that was an important thing.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.800]   It was the right thing as part of the pandemic that we've been going through.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.880]   But alongside of physical distancing came something else.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.000]   I call it social distancing, not the way that people used to promote social distancing.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.080]   I think it's okay to physically distance with this pandemic.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.400]   But what's come alongside of that is a desire in us to actually begin to distance ourselves
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.840]   emotionally from those around us.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.920]   Beginning to distance ourselves, not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.960]   from the ones that mean the most to us in our lives.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.360]   We found ourselves with this growing sense of social anxiety during this time, where
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.960]   we don't want to catch this disease.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.280]   And if someone's caught the disease, there's suddenly like a little bit of an outcast in
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.280]   society.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.080]   Don't go near that person because you might get infected.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.080]   And here's a phenomenon that's happened during the time of 2020.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.360]   Did you know statistics show that divorce has arisen much higher in number than at any
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.600]   time prior to the pandemic?
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.680]   Because here's the reality.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.000]   People know what it's like to live in their marriage, just basically doing surface things
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.700]   with their partner throughout the week.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.360]   But you throw them 24/7 in a house together where they can't leave, and tensions have
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.620]   begun to emerge.
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.820]   This is a challenge to us because I think when times are tough, when things are stressful,
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.340]   when things are hard, we begin to grate against some of those relationships in our lives.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.300]   We're going to find it hard to actually connect with people.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.500]   We find it hard to express the emotions and be honest about what we're going through.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.700]   And so we actually put up a front and we get angry and irritable and begin to rub against
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.980]   each other in the wrong way.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.400]   And so we naturally distance ourselves or we begin to upset.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.100]   Some of you watching this, you know this.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.340]   Your marriage is in maybe the hardest place it's been in for many years.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.260]   Some of you know this because of your workplace.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.900]   You found you've got breakdowns in relationships in your work.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.500]   I think for us here in Hong Kong, it's magnified because of everything we've been through in
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.460]   the last two years politically in the city.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.860]   Not only have we had this pandemic, which has caused us at times to have fractions and
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.940]   frictions with our closest people that we're in relationship with, we've also got all this
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.420]   political anxiety and all the change that's happening here politically and everybody's
[00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.220]   opinions and thinking about that.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.300]   And the way that that has also deeply divided our families, deeply divided us from our relationships
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:48.740]   deeply created issues for us, perhaps with those that we've come to love the most.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.900]   I want to speak this over us as a church.
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.060]   I believe as we enter into 2021, we have a great opportunity right before us.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.420]   It's been prepared by the Holy Spirit for this moment in this hour.
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:04.780]   And the opportunity is this, that we would actually see that trauma could be a catalyst
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.940]   towards a deepening of the most important relationships in our lives rather than a fraction
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.660]   and a division in them.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:17.300]   That maybe actually post-traumatic growth might say to us that actually it's in traumatic
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:22.700]   experiences where we can have a wake up call and realize that we need to actually reach
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.500]   out and beyond, even though it feels like the last thing we want to do, that actually
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.220]   maybe the right thing to do is to actually open ourselves up and be known and honest
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.820]   about all the things that are in our lives, because we need to have that healing that
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.380]   can only come through being deeply in relationship with others.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.380]   The research through post-traumatic growth has suggested that often people who have gone
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.220]   through crazy traumatic times prior to the trauma, they put relationships pretty low
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.500]   down on the list of things that were important.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.960]   Maybe at the top was work, maybe it was career, maybe it was making money, maybe it was doing
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.800]   projects and putting in success, but right in the middle of their trauma, they realized
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.060]   that actually the relationship that they suddenly needed the most were distant from them because
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.780]   they had pushed those relationships away.
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.620]   And that actually trauma was an awakening time for them to realize that as they came
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.580]   out of that trauma, they needed to double down on the most important relationship in
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.780]   their lives.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.220]   One of the people that was interviewed recently said it this way, he said, "I came out of
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.880]   trauma realizing that it's people over projects."
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.220]   My good friend Josh, that we've been talking about a little bit in this series, I think
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.180]   manifested this so powerfully.
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.940]   Josh had always been someone who put people over projects, but his trauma of the two years
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.860]   of his journey with cancer put himself in a realization that actually the relationships
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.100]   around him were the most important thing.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.020]   And he invested so beautifully and so heavily in those important relationships, even ones
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:51.540]   that were quite strained became renewed and rejuvenated through the work of the Spirit
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.340]   in the midst of his trauma.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.340]   And I know that just before he passed away, one of the things that he was so proud of
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.340]   was how deep his marriage was, how deep his relationships was with his parents, how deep
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:07.780]   he was in terms of reconciling some of the broken relationships he'd had in his life.
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:13.980]   It was a joy to him to find community in the midst of trauma.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.300]   Jesus understood this better than anyone.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.220]   Jesus understood that there was a powerful connection between trauma and healing that
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.100]   could only come through community.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:30.000]   And I want to actually just share a story from Scripture today that draws out the beauty
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.620]   of what it is to find community in the midst of our trauma.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.980]   And that community could actually be a catalyst for us for our greatest amount of healing
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.620]   and growth as human beings.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.820]   I want to take this story from Luke chapter eight, and I'm going to start in verse 40.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.580]   Let me read this to us.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.380]   Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him for they were all expecting him.
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:58.460]   Then a man named Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus's feet,
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:03.340]   pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter, a girl of about 12, was
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.980]   dying.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.460]   As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.780]   And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for 12 years.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.740]   No one could heal her.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:21.340]   She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak and immediately her bleeding
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.340]   stopped.
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.900]   "Who touched me?"
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.700]   Jesus asked.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.460]   When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing around
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.460]   you."
[00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.580]   But Jesus said, "Someone touched me.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.440]   I know that power has gone out from me."
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.140]   Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.480]   feet.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:50.000]   In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she was now
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.180]   instantly healed.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.900]   And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.900]   Go in peace."
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.980]   Luke recounts for us this moment.
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.180]   It's kind of just a random moment in Jesus's ministry.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.700]   He's just walking and ministering in the crowds of Galilee.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.980]   And I think every day he had requests and people coming to him, asking him for all sorts
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.980]   of things.
[00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.460]   And here's Jairus saying, "Hey, would you come to my house and heal my daughter?"
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.180]   Jesus walking on the way to do that.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:24.160]   And a woman who has been subject to bleeding for 12 years, she comes forward, she pushes
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.460]   her way through the crowd.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.180]   She reaches out and just grabs the hem of Jesus's garment.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:32.340]   And immediately, instantly, she's healed.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.800]   Luke describes a few things about this woman.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.740]   He says that she had been subject to bleeding for 12 years.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:43.060]   Now it's not specifically stated in the text, but this is likely to be a uterine hemorrhage.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.340]   It was a relatively embarrassing, relatively shameful thing to have.
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.540]   And she had spent a lot of money trying to heal herself over that period of time, but
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.980]   nothing had helped her.
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.260]   Now the thing that's really important to know about this that's implicit in the text and
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:03.220]   not explained directly here in the words Luke uses, is that because of her bleeding, she
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:09.340]   was actually deemed to be unclean by society, both the Jewish and social society of the
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.340]   day.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:16.940]   Her bleeding meant that she was ceremonially unclean, that anybody she touched and anybody
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.740]   who touched her would also automatically then be unclean.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.660]   Now the way you get yourself from being unclean to clean again was actually a long process
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.460]   of religious ritual.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.900]   It required the cleansing of you.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.460]   It required all these prayers.
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.640]   It required you going before a priest and a priest anointing you and declaring that
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.380]   you are clean again.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.500]   It wasn't an easy thing.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.520]   And so if you were deemed to be unclean, all of society would stay away from you.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.380]   They would distance themselves from you.
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.260]   They would say that this person out here is one that if we touch, we'd have to go through
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.260]   all that.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.520]   So they would push that person away.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.620]   You can imagine for this lady herself, she's been subject to this for 12 years.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.660]   And not only is there shame in her own physical brokenness, the fact that she can't heal herself
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.940]   and stop the bleeding, but there's an even deeper and greater shame about the distancing
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.140]   that everybody's done around her.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.740]   She's alone.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.600]   She's cast out.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.220]   She's pushed aside and her trauma is both the community leaving her, but also I believe
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.460]   her then distancing herself from the community.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.060]   You can almost imagine her walling herself off and saying, "Well, if they're going to
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.020]   treat me like that, well then I'm just going to distance myself."
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.900]   And a hardness coming over her in that way.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:37.080]   I mean, this is a woman who's had to carry this kind of trauma for over 12 years.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.380]   And there's habits that have formed in her where she will never go out in a crowd.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.300]   She will never find herself in public.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:49.580]   She would retreat and live her own life separate and isolated from everyone else, except for
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:50.580]   this day.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.640]   Because on this day, she hears that Jesus is coming past.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.800]   And she's heard stories about Jesus.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.140]   She's heard stories about his healing and his power.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.580]   She's heard conversations that he's not just a rabbi, but a prophet.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:10.200]   And despite the reality that she lives her life distant from others and avoids crowds,
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:15.540]   she fights her way through the crowd in order to receive the healing that she believed that
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:16.540]   she could receive.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.120]   Notice, if she touched someone, they would become unclean.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.940]   She would have had to fight her way, touching many people to get towards where Jesus was.
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:32.720]   Not only that, but she reaches out to touch Jesus, believing that someone so pure and
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.900]   so beautiful and so holy and so powerful as this rabbi, if she could touch him, he might
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:44.780]   be able to touch her and cleanse her and renew her and heal her and establish her again as
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.260]   a true person in her community.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.380]   The courage to do this is unbelievable.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:57.820]   I mean, the risk she took that day to fight through the crowd just blows my mind.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:03.020]   This is like if somebody was like a COVID positive person and they were getting on the
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.580]   MTR in rush hour and they let everybody know around them that they were COVID positive.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.400]   Can you imagine what the crowd would do to that person here in Hong Kong in this time?
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.280]   They would scream, there would be panic, everybody would move out of the way, nobody would want
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.180]   to get anywhere near that person.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.780]   That's the woman here.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.940]   She was risking the crowd, understanding that she was unclean and all the hostility that
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.940]   would happen.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:30.260]   She was willing to risk that in order to touch the hem of Jesus's garments.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:37.140]   The Bible tells us here that as she touched him, immediately she was healed.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.660]   Look at this, immediately she was healed.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.380]   Now this is really important for what's about to happen next.
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.260]   There's not a progress in her healing here.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.900]   This is not like another time where Jesus spat on the mud and put it on the eyes and
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.460]   the person couldn't see properly and then he prayed again and suddenly they were healed.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.940]   There's no journey in healing for this woman.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.580]   She's immediately, the emphasis in the Greek is on the moment that it happened.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.700]   It happened straight away.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:06.960]   Twelve years of shame and trauma and ridicule immediately removed in the physical healing
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.220]   that she suddenly experienced in that moment.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.980]   But this is important because of what happens next.
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.780]   Jesus stops.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.540]   He knows that power has gone out from him and he says these words.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.500]   He says, "Who touched me?"
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.220]   It seems like a pretty kind of like not that big deal of a statement, right?
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.820]   Like he's just like, "Who touched me?"
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.180]   But there were so many crowds around him, so many people pushing in on him that Peter
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.060]   goes, "What are you talking about, man?
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.060]   What do you mean?
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   Look at everybody.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.060]   Everybody's touching you.
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.300]   Everybody's pushing in on you."
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.860]   And he's like, "No, no, no.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   Someone touched me.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.540]   I know power has gone out.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.380]   Who touched me?"
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.940]   Here's what I think Jesus is doing in this moment.
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.140]   He realizes about this woman.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.140]   He's the son of God.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.500]   He knows exactly what's taking place.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.980]   He knows everything about this woman.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.900]   He knows how she's fought through the crowds and he knows how she's come out and touched
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.900]   him.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.780]   And he's standing there and before the crowds, he's intentionally creating space for her
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.660]   to have the courage to come forward and be known.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.380]   You see, Jesus could have turned around and said, "Hey, you lady, you who touched me,
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:13.620]   come forward."
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.100]   But he doesn't do that.
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.500]   He instead says, "Who touched me?"
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:26.820]   It's his way of saying to her directly, "Will you have the courage to make yourself known?"
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.820]   Now the woman didn't need to do it.
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:36.460]   She didn't need to come forward for her physical healing.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.320]   It wasn't like she was still wondering whether she had actually been restored and maybe I
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.540]   should go forward just to get the fullness of my healing.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.940]   The Bible had told us immediately she'd been healed.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.500]   Just as anonymously as she had touched the garment and received the thing that she had
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.600]   come from, she could have anonymously then just walked away.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.460]   She could have just escaped the crowd and gone in the other direction.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.100]   And no one would have known other than Jesus that that would happen.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:08.220]   There was no reason for her to step forward unless there was another piece of healing
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.420]   she needed to receive.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:15.260]   Get this church, Jesus calls her out, not just because he wants her to receive her physical
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:21.580]   healing, but because he wants her to see and feel her social healing as well.
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.940]   Because it was her bleeding that had caused her to be cut out from the very crowd that
[00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.340]   she had just fought through.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.260]   And in him saying, "Hey, come forward now," what he's doing is creating space for her
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:36.860]   to actually walk into a place where she can stand in front of that community and testify
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.020]   to the reality that God has actually cleaned her.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:47.140]   That she has been restored by him into community.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:52.500]   The Bible tells us that rather than walking in the other direction anonymously, she steps
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.540]   forward before Jesus.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.260]   She comes and she falls at his feet.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.060]   And in front of all the crowd, she tells everybody why she pushed through the crowd, why she
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.220]   grabbed the hem of the garment, the healing she had received.
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.540]   And she confesses it before everybody.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.980]   She takes the great courage to be known.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.980]   I think church, this is one of the greatest examples of courage that we have in the New
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.980]   Testament.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.800]   Not only did she have the faith originally to touch the hem of the garment, but now she's
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.900]   decided to push through the crowd once more and stand before everybody and confess the
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:32.740]   ugliness of her trauma and the reality that she has been so hurt by everybody around her.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:37.660]   And yet now the one who's healed her is in her midst.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.580]   I want you to see how Jesus responds to her in front of everybody.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.980]   First of all, he says, "Daughter."
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.540]   He addresses her daughter.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:50.000]   There is no other time in the gospels where Jesus speaks to a woman and uses this title.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.400]   This is the only example in all of the gospel stories that Jesus addresses a woman and calls
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.800]   her daughter.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.640]   The word actually was an incredibly intimate word.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.680]   It was a word that was only reserved and used for a father speaking to his biological child.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.040]   Jesus stands in front of everybody and says, "You're not just somebody I know.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:10.200]   You're not just a friend of mine.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.280]   You're not a disciple even.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.000]   You're intimately part of my family.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.520]   I am so here with you.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.560]   You're my daughter whom I love.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.720]   With you I'm well pleased."
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.240]   A similar kind of thing that God said over Jesus at his baptism.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:30.480]   Here's Jesus addressing this woman who has been so isolated by community for 12 years
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.000]   and he's saying, "You are in the middle of the most intimate community you could ever
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   have.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.120]   Restoration in your relationship with your father, with me, with your God.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.080]   You're my daughter."
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.400]   And then in front of everybody, he says, "Your faith has healed you."
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.600]   I think Jesus is speaking there of both her faith to push through that crowd right at
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.840]   the beginning, but also her faith to push through the crowd on the second time and stand
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:04.400]   before everybody and testify to her brokenness and her healing.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:11.520]   The woman had the courage to be known and that faith healed her.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.440]   And Jesus uses those words on purpose because he wants all the crowd to know that she has
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.200]   received both her physical and her social healing.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.520]   That where they had to be distant from her before, they can now draw close.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.800]   And where she, if she had slipped away from the crowd anonymously that day, would have
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.060]   continued to live a habit of isolation, she now was being challenged to stand in front
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:40.360]   of everyone and welcome people into her journey so that she could be healed, not just physically,
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:45.400]   but emotionally and spiritually in her community.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:51.360]   Jesus was passionate about relationships and Jesus understood that healing was so much
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.880]   more than just physical.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.640]   I want to speak to you right now in this moment.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.400]   Where has it been in this last little while that you've been experiencing, all that we've
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.520]   been experiencing in this pandemic?
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.320]   Where have you begun to isolate and distance yourself from others?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.200]   Where have you allowed your emotions that you're carrying at this time to wall you off
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.580]   from the people that you love the most?
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.320]   For those of you who are struggling in your marriages right now, where have you put up
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:23.640]   walls with your partner because of the intensity of what you guys have been going through together?
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.200]   Maybe I want to say this as well.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.720]   I believe that there are some people watching this where there's a secret sin that's been
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   going on in your life.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.180]   A little bit like for me where there's the secretness of my insecurity and on the surface
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.480]   in front of the church, I was the best pastor I could be, but inside I was dying and that
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   tension boiled over to a panic attack.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.280]   I think there's some people watching this right now and that resonates for you.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.200]   There's a secret sin.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.400]   There's something that you're doing that nobody else knows about and it's hidden.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.280]   And because of that, you've been ashamed of who you are.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.520]   You're ashamed of what you've done.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.600]   And yet I believe God's standing before you today like he did that woman.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.800]   And he's saying, "Who touched me?"
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.240]   Are you willing to come out of the shadows and make yourself known?
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.600]   That you're healing, that you actually long for.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.520]   You don't want to feel the way you do inside.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.760]   You don't want to feel caught up and in battle in your spirit inside.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.840]   You don't want to feel the panic and the anxiety and the shame anymore.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.920]   No, you actually do want to be known.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.320]   But remember what I said at the beginning, trauma fights to rip community from us.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.120]   The irony is when we need it the most, we want it the least.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.560]   That's how you're feeling right now.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.680]   But I want to say this, God creates a space for you in his grace.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   It's a space for you.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.800]   He's not going to force you, but he invites you to step into that space and say, "You
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.800]   know what?
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.600]   Not everything is right inside.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   You know what?
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.800]   I've been carrying some stuff that I am proud of.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   You know what?
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   It's been hard lately.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   You know what?
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   I've been struggling.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   You know what?
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   I need help.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.440]   I need to respond in some way."
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.680]   Today this message is a grace space for you.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.640]   A chance for you to come out of the shadows and come into the light.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:09.160]   To begin to repair some of the broken relationships around you by being honest and humble, being
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.880]   real and taking courage.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.720]   It's going to require a lot of courage for you to do this.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.240]   It's not going to be an easy thing, but we've got a lot of ways here at the Vine where you
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.880]   can receive the help that you need, where you can be reestablished and reconnected in
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880]   the community.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.600]   At five o'clock today, we have a group of pastors that every Sunday are prepared to
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.200]   pray and minister to you.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.560]   They're available today.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.200]   And maybe for some of you, that's a step forward.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.800]   That's like you coming out of the crowd and going, "You know what?
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   I need prayer.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   You know what?
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   I need help.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   I can't get through this on my own."
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.680]   For some of you, maybe it's the need for your community group to come around you.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.640]   If you're in community group, maybe there's a community group leader who can stand with
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   you and pray for you.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.320]   I want to encourage you to reach out to your community group leader this week.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.200]   If you're not in a community, but you want someone to come around you and pray for you
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:05.560]   here at the Vine and you're not available today to be able to do that, email pastoralcare@thevine.org.hk.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   That will open you up for one of our pastors to reach out to you, to connect with you and
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   to pray for you.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.080]   We have an amazing team of counselors here at the Vine called Oasis, who are loving and
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:19.160]   willing to stand with you and pray for you and to actually walk with you in counseling.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.920]   When I eventually confessed to Chris how I was feeling and began to move into a place
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:30.400]   of that healing, I went into counseling for almost a two-year period, walking with a counselor
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.000]   on a weekly basis to receive the healing that I needed and the growth that I needed.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.560]   Maybe that's part of your journey too.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:43.400]   I want to pull all this together and I want to encourage you and challenge you by speaking
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.080]   something that I think is important for each one of us to understand as we draw this to
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.080]   a close.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.720]   Let me say this over us.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.960]   As we learn to walk together in open, broken and vulnerable relationships, caring for one
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.800]   another as we discuss our struggles and issues and rejoicing together in our victories and
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:08.160]   our healing, we are going to see personal growth in each one of us like never before.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.280]   That's my heart for you, church, that you would grow out of the trauma that you're feeling
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:19.480]   in a way that you connect in a deeper level with relationships around you like never before.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:25.340]   Like the woman in the story that we looked at today, will you hear God calling you out
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:31.720]   of the midst of the trauma that you're in right now and inviting you forward to be known?
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.320]   And will you, like the woman, step forward?
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.880]   That's my challenge.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:45.360]   That's my offer to you today, to step forward into the arms of God's grace again and to
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:51.000]   be reestablished in those deepest relationships and to know that out of them will come the
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.520]   greatest amount of growth and healing from your trauma.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.760]   Let me pray for us, church.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   Let's pray.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.720]   Father, we just are so grateful for this moment.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.880]   So grateful that we get to stand together as a fellowship and as a community.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.360]   And Lord, we recognize that so often we do retreat from the amazing people that you've
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:19.160]   put around us, that so often in our anxiety and our stress and our trauma, we turn inwards
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.560]   rather than outwards.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.920]   We recognize that we put up barriers and walls to keep people out at times.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.560]   And Father, some of us have done that consciously and some of us do that subconsciously.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:37.920]   But Lord, it creates a barrier from the thing that actually is going to provide the greatest
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.600]   amount of healing for us, the men and women that you've put in our lives to love us and
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   care for us.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:50.560]   And so Lord, we come to you in this moment, humble before you, realizing that in the midst
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:56.100]   of the crowd, you make a space and you don't force us.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.840]   But in your grace, you say, "Will you step forward and be known?"
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.480]   And I know from my own journey, being known before, first of all, my wife and then being
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.160]   known before the church in the years ahead has been the thing that's really helped to
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.680]   strengthen my healing.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.160]   And Father, I believe that's going to be the same for many listening to this today.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   Lord, where the enemy's had a strategy to keep things in the dark.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.040]   Father, I want to pray over those particularly that are struggling with secret sin, with
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.440]   stuff that's going on in their lives that no one knows about, but is tearing them up
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.440]   inside.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:36.120]   Lord, the enemy will create a strategy of shame and fear.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.420]   Oh, what if people knew that they wouldn't be your friend anymore?
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.640]   And like that prayer I said to Chris, I said, "If I fail, will you still love me?"
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.780]   Those are the tricks that the enemy so often plays in our minds when we're dealing with
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.780]   secret sin.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.160]   Oh, if somebody knew this about me, they would never accept me ever again.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.880]   Father, we stand against that in the name of Jesus.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.440]   And we pray the love of Christ of every person watching this right now.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.400]   And Lord, where the enemy would try to cut us off from one another.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.380]   Father, we pray for a release of your Spirit upon your people, that anyone who's walking
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:18.120]   in darkness today would look up towards the light and would like that woman have the courage
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.200]   to take the risk to step forward this week.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.040]   So that's where the pastor here at the Vine, their community group leader, maybe it's their
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.400]   spouse, maybe it's a prayer partner that they're comfortable with, but they're willing to step
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.600]   forward and reach out and say, "I will be known."
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.920]   So Father, we pray for the power of your Spirit to be at work for each person on that journey
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   this week.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.200]   And we thank you for the relationships you've placed around us.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.400]   Lord, may they be great wisdom and strength and encouragement and power to us.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.680]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   Everyone says.
