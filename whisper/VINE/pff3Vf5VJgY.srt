1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 Thank you, Justin. Good morning, church.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,680
 As always, it's an honor to be here to talk, to share God's word with you guys,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,600
 but we need to talk, church.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,120
 Now, these four words, "We need to talk," can strike fear into people's hearts

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,200
 because usually when you say these words within a relationship,

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,560
 it means something has gone wrong, something needs addressing.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,440
 So this morning, I'm here to say, "We need to talk."

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,160
 Now, don't worry too much, okay? I'm not breaking up with you guys

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,200
 and going to Island ECC or anything like that, okay?

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,680
 Don't worry. It's not about that.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,760
 But we need to talk because as I've looked around me,

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,360
 it's obvious that relationships on every level are suffering.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,200
 The past years we've had of social and political unrest

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,120
 added to the stress of COVID has caused some deep hurt and suffering

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,560
 and distrust amongst relationships on every single level.

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,360
 Society has become divided, highly distrustful and suspicious of each other.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,280
 When we meet people, we ask questions like,

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,080
 "Well, where does this person sit politically?

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,800
 Has this person been vaccinated? Are those allergies or do they have COVID?"

20
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,680
 And all these things added to the already cutthroat,

21
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,720
 winner-takes-all survival of the fittest mentality

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,240
 that seems to drive our city has led to us being colder,

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,080
 more selfish and self-serving.

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,320
 Of course, this isn't new.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,400
 First century Israel knew exactly what it was like to live in divided times.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,280
 Within Jewish culture was embedded a great deal of division.

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,640
 Men and women would not interact with each other publicly.

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,280
 Slavery and the abuse of human rights was a significant issue.

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
 There was a massive divide between the rich and the poor.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
 People who were deemed as unclean were shunned

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,120
 and unable to participate with normal community activities.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,840
 Certain professions were looked down upon.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
 And then from a religious perspective,

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,640
 within Judaism were the sects of the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Essenes,

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,840
 all which had slightly varieting theologies

36
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,240
 about what they believed about God and the afterlife and all that kind of stuff.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,840
 Then, of course, there was a division between Jews and Gentiles

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,320
 and the Samaritans, and there was so much antagonism over.

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,240
 Then frame all of this with the evil Roman Empire governing their land,

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,360
 and you might begin to see why life in first century Israel

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,640
 was divided and segregated.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
 And this is why when Jesus began his ministry,

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,560
 he caused a lot of problems because he encouraged everyone to love,

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,040
 he encouraged people to serve, to be in relationship with each other,

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,280
 no matter who they were.

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,480
 That was Jesus' message, constantly and provocatively, proactively,

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,560
 reaching out and loving even up to his enemies.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,640
 He showed love, he showed care unconditionally,

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,200
 regardless of race, gender, social status or beliefs.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,120
 And we, as his followers' church, have been called to do the same.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
 And so this is what we need to talk about.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
 Because as I said, at this moment in Hong Kong,

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,200
 there is an opportunity.

54
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
 Relationships are broken,

55
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280
 and we have been called to do for our society what Jesus did for his.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
 So this is why over the next six weeks,

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,760
 we're going to look at different gospel messages

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,760
 to see exactly how Jesus challenged the status quo

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,520
 and how Jesus challenged people out of their comfort zones

60
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,160
 in order for us to learn to do the same for our city and our context.

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,360
 Now, the danger, of course, is if we don't do anything about this,

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,600
 these divisions settle in.

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,920
 And as a result, we build up walls that are so high and so strong

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,160
 that we're unable to connect and love each other.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
 But as we said, this would grieve God's heart.

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
 Because we, as his followers, as his church,

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,480
 have been called to be reconcilers, haven't we?

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,840
 To be peacemakers, to bring God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven,

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,840
 to love as he has first loved us.

70
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,400
 So this series is going to look at all different sections of relationship.

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,360
 It's going to call and challenge us to act,

72
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,640
 because we want to see relationships redeemed and restored

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,720
 in the name of Jesus, amen?

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,160
 We want to see a society that genuinely cares for the well-being of each other.

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,280
 We want to see people being able to live sacrificially.

76
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
 We want a church that truly functions as the body of Christ.

77
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,920
 We want to see healthy, thriving families.

78
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,000
 We want to see a church that unashamedly lives for Jesus.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,040
 And ultimately, we want to know and love,

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,720
 we want to know the love of Christ

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,640
 and be the example of how we approach and treat each other.

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,960
 That is our heart for this sermon series over the next few weeks.

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,640
 And so to kick things off,

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,680
 we're going to start with the story of the Good Samaritan.

85
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,120
 Now, I know it's a well-known story,

86
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,640
 but let's remind ourselves of it again before we carry on.

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,160
 Listen carefully, Luke 10, 25 to 37,

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,640
 and you can read along on the screen or on your device,

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,760
 on your Bible, if you have one.

90
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,400
 Luke 10, 25, it starts like this.

91
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,680
 "On this one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,880
 'Teacher,' he said, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?'

93
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
 'What is written in the law?' Jesus replied.

94
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,040
 'How do you read it?'

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,400
 He answered, 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart,

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
 with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,640
 and love your neighbor as yourself.'

98
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,440
 'You have answered correctly,' Jesus replied.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,000
 'Do this and you will live.'

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,760
 But he wanted to justify himself.

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,840
 So he asked Jesus, 'And who is my neighbor?'

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
 'In reply,' Jesus said,

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,040
 'While a man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho,

104
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,840
 where he was attacked by robbers,

105
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,920
 they stripped him of his clothes,

106
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,080
 beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.

107
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,240
 A priest happened to be going down the same road,

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,880
 and when he saw the man, he passed on by the other side.

109
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
 So too a Levite, when he came to the place,

110
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
 and saw him, passed by on the other side.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,360
 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came to where the man was,

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
 and when he saw him, he took pity on him.

113
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,320
 He went to him, bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.

114
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,040
 He put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn,

115
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
 and took care of him.

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 The next day he took out two denarii and gave it to the innkeeper.

117
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return,

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,320
 I will reimburse you for any extra expense you might have.'

119
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,240
 'Which of these three do you think was the neighbor

120
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,600
 to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?'

121
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,480
 The expert in the law replied, 'The one who had mercy on him.'

122
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,160
 Jesus told him, 'Go and do likewise.'"

123
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,480
 So a few years back, when Pastor Tim first arrived back into Hong Kong,

124
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,960
 Pastor Tim and I have known each other for some years.

125
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
 We spent some time in ministry here in Hong Kong.

126
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,920
 He went back to Germany and the US and came back.

127
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,080
 And so when he came back to Hong Kong,

128
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,120
 my wife and I, Brittany, were there to welcome him at the airport.

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,560
 Remember those tides when we used to welcome people at the airport?

130
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,040
 So we were waiting for Tim and we were looking around

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,160
 and we saw a man going, you know, we were in the arrivals hall

132
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
 and there was those escalators that go up to the departures,

133
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
 lounge, and the check-in area.

134
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,640
 So this was a man, you know, he was standing by himself going up the escalator.

135
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,200
 He was standing there like this with his hands by his side.

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,840
 But as he was going up the escalator, he was looking a bit wobbly,

137
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
 a bit like this, you know, wobble, wibble, wobble.

138
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
 And then suddenly, he face-planted, straight down, hands by his side,

139
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
 like a plank, boom, face down, making the loudest noise,

140
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
 hitting the escalator, face first.

141
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,640
 And I saw this happen in front of my very eyes, okay?

142
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,800
 Bang, hit the escalator.

143
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,520
 Now, a few people around me also noticed what was going on,

144
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,840
 but I saw them do this and they quickly looked away,

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,160
 pretended like they didn't see anything.

146
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,080
 I did not know what to do, okay?

147
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
 I'm not a doctor, I'm not really first aid trained or anything like that,

148
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,880
 but just instinctively, I thought, "Well, I have to go and check on this guy."

149
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,240
 So I ran up there to see if he was okay.

150
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,840
 And when I got there, he was lift.

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,920
 Someone had pressed the emergency stop button,

152
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,160
 but he was just laying there, like stiff as a board,

153
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,560
 just laying there face down on the escalator.

154
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
 A little pool of blood had started to form around his face.

155
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
 So I was like, "Oh my gosh, it was something like a movie,

156
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
 like what happened?"

157
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,560
 And I reached closer, I was going to tap, I didn't want to move him,

158
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,120
 I didn't know what to do, and I was about to tap him on the shoulder.

159
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
 When he suddenly woke up, he turned around, he was like,

160
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
 "Oh, I need another whiskey!"

161
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,840
 True story, okay? It was like it was out of a movie.

162
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,760
 So thankfully, in the end, he was fine.

163
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
 He seemed to have a very nasty scratch on his face,

164
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,880
 but to be honest, the whiskey he had in him already

165
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,960
 probably helped ease the pain a little bit, all right?

166
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,800
 But I tell you this story

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
 because we've probably all faced similar situations before.

168
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,960
 We see another person in need,

169
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,640
 and in those moments, we need to decide, "Well, what do we do?"

170
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,960
 Do we engage with what's happening,

171
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,800
 or do we try and help,

172
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
 or do we pretend like we don't see anything happening

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,760
 and look the other way and carry on ourselves?

174
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,520
 Now, on the surface, the good Samaritan story

175
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,680
 seems to be teaching this lesson, saying that

176
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,200
 we should always be ready to help others in need,

177
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,320
 always be ready to help.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,040
 And to be honest, that's not a bad lesson.

179
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,760
 If we learn this simple rule alone,

180
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,520
 the world itself would be a much better place.

181
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,080
 So there you have it, the shortest Vine sermon ever.

182
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,840
 This is what happens when Andrew is away.

183
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
 Thank you very much.

184
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,120
 You can go off to lunch now, and worship team's gonna...

185
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,240
 That's not all, though.

186
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,960
 Because, church, helping others is just the bare minimum.

187
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,840
 And in fact, this parable has so much more to say

188
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,800
 than simply being a helpful human being to those around you.

189
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,840
 So let's find out, okay?

190
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,080
 We're gonna dig into the scripture a little bit,

191
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
 walk with me through it,

192
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,320
 'cause we're gonna find out

193
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
 what it's really trying to communicate to us.

194
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
 We start again in verse 25.

195
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,280
 "On one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus.

196
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,400
 He asked him a question.

197
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,920
 'Teacher,' he asked, 'what must I do to inherit eternal life?'"

198
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
 What a question.

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
 Now, the gospel is full of questions.

200
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
 Apparently, in the gospel,

201
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,240
 according to my Logos Bible concordance,

202
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,400
 there are 187 questions that Jesus is asked

203
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,520
 throughout the four gospels.

204
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,280
 Well, questions are good.

205
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,960
 Actually, there's people who are professionals at asking questions.

206
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,080
 Two groups of people, I think,

207
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,920
 are the best question askers in the world.

208
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,720
 The first are toddlers, okay?

209
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,560
 Toddlers love to ask why.

210
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,840
 Why, why, why, why?

211
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,720
 Why this, why that?

212
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,440
 Why, why, why?

213
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,840
 And for the first few minutes, a toddler asks why.

214
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,120
 It's kind of cute, right?

215
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,600
 But then, really quickly, it gets kind of annoying.

216
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,080
 So that's the first professional question askers.

217
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,000
 The second group of professional question askers are lawyers.

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,200
 They, too, like to ask things like why, when, how, who, what.

219
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
 And for the first few minutes, it's pretty helpful,

220
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
 but very quickly, it becomes very expensive.

221
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,400
 Questions can be a beautiful thing, right?

222
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,880
 If you ask the right questions in the proper context

223
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
 or the right intentions,

224
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,640
 it can lead to these lovely, life-giving conversations.

225
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
 These are the type of questions

226
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,080
 that strong, trusting relationships are built upon.

227
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,600
 Good questions.

228
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,920
 Questions that address the heart

229
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,560
 and allow you to share freely about yourself.

230
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
 On the other hand, though,

231
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
 questions can be used to attack,

232
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,520
 to intimidate,

233
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,040
 to intrude into another person's life.

234
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,520
 Questions can be used to make others look incompetent

235
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,920
 and make ourselves look better.

236
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,920
 In this instance, we have Jesus being questioned by a lawyer.

237
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,360
 But we need to notice the motivation

238
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
 for him asking Jesus this question.

239
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,040
 He's not trying to build a relationship with Jesus.

240
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,920
 Instead, he's trying to do the latter.

241
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,600
 This verse tells us that he's trying to test Jesus.

242
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,920
 Now, the word "test" is the same word used in Luke 4:12

243
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,280
 to describe the devil's temptation of Jesus.

244
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,680
 In other words, this isn't a regular questioning session.

245
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
 There is something sinister

246
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,800
 about the way this lawyer is approaching Jesus.

247
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,760
 And it says, "So this expert of the law

248
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,640
 is trying to get Jesus to say the wrong thing

249
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,680
 so he can accuse Jesus of some sort of false teaching."

250
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,720
 Again, the question at hand is this.

251
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,200
 "What must I do to inherit eternal life?"

252
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,960
 Now, this was a pretty standard question

253
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,560
 for the people in Jesus' time.

254
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,200
 So there was a pretty standard answer.

255
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,080
 This is what he's trying to see.

256
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,160
 Is Jesus going to give the standard answer?

257
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
 Or is he going to say something else?

258
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,040
 But Jesus sees this as a trap.

259
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,440
 And so he doesn't engage with it.

260
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
 He's not going to fall for this trap.

261
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,040
 Instead, he turns the question back around to this lawyer.

262
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,240
 And to his credit, this guy is a lawyer.

263
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,440
 He knows his stuff pretty well.

264
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,320
 Jesus says to the man, "Well, what do you think?

265
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
 What's written in the law?

266
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
 How do you read it?"

267
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,520
 He answered, "Love the Lord your God

268
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,760
 with all your heart, with all your soul,

269
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
 with all your strength, and with all your mind.

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,160
 And love your neighbor as yourself."

271
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,440
 "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied.

272
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,080
 "Do this and you will live."

273
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,600
 It's a classic Jesus move, right?

274
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,240
 He answers a question with a question of his own.

275
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,240
 This was the ideal answer.

276
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
 This was the thing that all Jewish kids

277
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,520
 would have learned growing up and held on to as adults.

278
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,960
 The first part of this answer is, of course, the Shema,

279
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
 Deuteronomy 6, 5.

280
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,000
 "Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,200
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart,

282
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,160
 mind, soul, and strength."

283
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,760
 The cornerstone verse of the Jewish faith.

284
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,480
 Everyone would have known this verse.

285
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,080
 Everyone would have memorized this

286
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,800
 as part of their cultural identity.

287
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,400
 The Shema, like I said, the key,

288
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,160
 the cornerstone of the Jewish faith.

289
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,880
 But to the Shema, he adds a quote from Leviticus 19.18.

290
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,400
 "Love your neighbor as yourself."

291
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,440
 And when you put these two together,

292
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,080
 you've come up with the golden rule,

293
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,960
 the best answer ever.

294
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,000
 It's such a good answer that Jesus quotes

295
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,200
 these two passages exactly when he himself is asked,

296
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,640
 "Well, what's the greatest commandment?"

297
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,520
 Mark 12.29, he gives the same answer.

298
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,920
 "Do this," Jesus says, "and you will live."

299
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,440
 In other words, if you can follow this golden rule,

300
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,360
 you will inherit the eternal life that you're hoping for.

301
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,920
 But like I said, it's not as simple as that.

302
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,440
 This isn't where the story ends.

303
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,200
 And it's at this point we begin to see the true motivations

304
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
 exactly why this lawyer was asking Jesus these questions.

305
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,760
 It tells us this in verse 29.

306
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,920
 "But he wanted to justify himself."

307
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,640
 He wanted to appear righteous before Jesus

308
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,320
 and everyone else who was around him

309
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
 so people would know that he himself,

310
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,960
 he had done enough to get this eternal life.

311
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,880
 I mean, after all, this was a guy in high standing.

312
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
 He was a religious leader.

313
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
 He was righteous in the eyes of others.

314
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
 No doubt that he would inherit this inheritance, right,

315
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
 from the Lord, this eternal life he was seeking.

316
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 So by him asking Jesus, "Who is my neighbor?"

317
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,440
 His intention wasn't really to find out who his neighbor was

318
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,400
 so that he could go and love them and serve them.

319
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,120
 What he was really trying to say was this,

320
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
 "You know what, Jesus, I already know who my neighbor is.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
 They're the people who are just like me.

322
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 You know, I give a little bit to the poor

323
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,680
 and all that kind of stuff.

324
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,280
 I do my duty there.

325
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,120
 But I'll have you know that I'm already doing all the right things.

326
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,880
 So just go ahead and tell everyone here that I'm doing fine

327
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
 and that I'm going to get eternal life."

328
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,560
 He felt like he had it all sorted out.

329
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,160
 He felt like he was already doing good enough.

330
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,040
 Now, we need to stop and think here for a minute.

331
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
 How would you have answered the question,

332
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,360
 "How or what must I do to get eternal life?"

333
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,200
 If we translated this question into slightly more modern-day context,

334
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,120
 it might sound like, "Well, how can I make sure that I get into heaven?"

335
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,720
 This is a question we ask ourselves often as Christians.

336
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
 This is a question that you've asked other people.

337
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,600
 This might even be something you use when it comes to evangelism.

338
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
 You know that good old question when you ask someone else,

339
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,880
 "Do you know what?

340
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,040
 If you died today, do you know where you would end up?"

341
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,640
 That question.

342
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,000
 I used to think that was a great way to start a gospel conversation

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
 until I was in a taxi one time,

344
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
 and I was trying to be all evangelistic,

345
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,360
 and I talked to the taxi driver,

346
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,640
 and I said, "Do you know where you're going to end up if you die today?"

347
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,880
 And the taxi driver thought I was going to rob him or something.

348
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
 He got so scared.

349
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,880
 He's like, "What are you talking about?

350
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
 Why are you asking me these strange questions?"

351
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,560
 But here's the catch, church.

352
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,800
 Yes, it might sound righteous on the outside,

353
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,560
 but this question,

354
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,400
 and it revealed something about the Lord's heart too,

355
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,360
 was really selfish because it was all about Himself.

356
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
 The expert in the Lord might have appeared righteous,

357
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,920
 might have sounded good on the outside,

358
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,640
 but His heart wasn't in the right place.

359
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,480
 And church, we are in danger of putting ourselves in the same situation.

360
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
 Why do we follow and believe in Jesus?

361
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,760
 Why do we come to church each Sunday?

362
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,600
 Why do we sing worship songs?

363
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,760
 Because if making it into heaven or getting eternal life,

364
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,960
 doing the bare minimum,

365
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
 loving people who are just like you,

366
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
 is the only motivation for believing in Jesus,

367
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
 then I would say we have it twisted.

368
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,880
 In fact, I would even say that if getting into heaven is our only motivation,

369
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,840
 we have fundamentally misunderstood what it means to follow Jesus.

370
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,840
 Let me explain.

371
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,200
 As we said earlier,

372
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
 there are lots of divisions and walls to our relationships within our own society.

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,560
 If we use the phrase, "Look out for number one," right?

374
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,360
 This could easily be the motto for Hong Kong.

375
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,080
 Remember during the early stages of COVID when everybody lost their minds?

376
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,720
 I mean, it was scary out there, we know,

377
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
 but we were hoarding food,

378
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,400
 we were buying more toilet paper than you could use in a lifetime.

379
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,880
 People were scared, people were hoarding,

380
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,520
 people were just looking out for themselves.

381
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,560
 What about the business sector?

382
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,960
 I am not a businessman,

383
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,360
 but from what it seems and what I hear,

384
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 relationships in this area seem to be pretty transactional, aren't they?

385
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,920
 And yes, I know, perhaps this is just how business works.

386
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,720
 But when we start to function in this mode,

387
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,760
 we start to see relationships as a means to an end.

388
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,920
 And we begin, we're beginning,

389
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,280
 sorry, we build relationships not because we genuinely care for each other,

390
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,120
 but because we want to gain something.

391
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,960
 And if we enter into a relationship that serves no profit for me,

392
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
 it's got no benefit for me,

393
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,880
 well then, peace out, I'm gone.

394
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,920
 What about the dating world?

395
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,000
 Again, I haven't been in the dating world for a long time now,

396
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,760
 but I don't know much in this area,

397
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
 but from what I ask my friends who are out there dating,

398
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
 the scene is rough.

399
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
 Because it seems as though people don't seem to be interested

400
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,880
 in committed long-term relationships,

401
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
 or very afraid to do so.

402
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,360
 It might spark up a conversation,

403
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
 slide into the DMs,

404
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,160
 and then just ghost you for no reason.

405
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,400
 So instead of dating to build strong relationships,

406
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,520
 to get to know each other,

407
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,400
 dating is used as a means to an end,

408
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,480
 to satisfy your own needs and move on.

409
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,080
 We heard just now about the situation between the rich and the poor.

410
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,440
 This week, I'm not sure,

411
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,760
 you must have seen that SCMP article,

412
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
 or the article on all cross-news platforms,

413
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
 highlighting the dividing line between the rich and the poor in Hong Kong

414
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,520
 has widened even further.

415
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,480
 The richest in Hong Kong, it tells us,

416
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,080
 earns 40 times more than the most impoverished.

417
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,160
 Think about that for a moment.

418
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,840
 I'm not a mathematician, I'm not a lot of things, it seems like.

419
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,800
 But it seems like,

420
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,440
 what this means, it potentially takes someone 40 years

421
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,560
 what someone else can make in one year.

422
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,520
 That's ridiculous.

423
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,520
 But we don't even have to look that deeply.

424
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
 Just go about your everyday life.

425
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,360
 We see that looking out for others is quite rare.

426
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,880
 Ride the empty-armed bus during rush hour.

427
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,640
 People push, shove past kids, pregnant people, elderly to get a seat.

428
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,560
 It's not uncommon to see a perfectly able-bodied person

429
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,760
 sitting on the priority seat on public transport,

430
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,720
 where there's an elderly person or disabled person, a pau-pau,

431
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,360
 or a bak-bak, you know, who's clearly much more in need,

432
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,560
 stay standing, staring at that person, hoping that their seat will come up.

433
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,040
 Oh, but you know what? It's okay.

434
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,000
 We don't need to be worried about any of that, right?

435
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,240
 Because we come to church on Sunday.

436
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
 We give a little bit of money.

437
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,160
 We do Bible study.

438
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,440
 We have a community group.

439
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
 We pray for each other.

440
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,320
 We sing nice songs.

441
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,840
 We keep all the messy stuff out there.

442
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,280
 And we try our best to stay pure.

443
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,520
 We don't watch any bad movies, say any bad words,

444
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
 or even when we do those things,

445
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
 we don't let anyone else know about those things.

446
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,280
 We remain obedient and hoping that at the end,

447
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,240
 God will give us the way to heaven.

448
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,160
 That's enough, right?

449
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,360
 This is precisely the mentality of the expert in the law.

450
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,720
 And this is why Jesus' answer was about to blow his mind

451
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
 and challenge him to his very core.

452
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
 "In reply," Jesus said to this man,

453
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,240
 "there was a person, a man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho

454
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
 when he was attacked by robbers.

455
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,800
 They stripped him of his clothes, beat him, left him half dead.

456
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,560
 Left him half dead.

457
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,400
 A priest and a Levite went down that same road.

458
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
 But these two guys, when they came to them,

459
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
 saw the place, saw him.

460
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,160
 They both passed by on the other side.

461
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,400
 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came to where the man was.

462
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
 When he saw him, he took pity on him.

463
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,760
 He bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine.

464
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
 And he put the man on his own donkey

465
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
 and brought him to an inn and took care of him.

466
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,960
 The next day, he took out two denarii

467
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,400
 and gave them to the innkeeper.

468
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return,

469
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,880
 I will reimburse for you any extra expense that you may have.'"

470
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,000
 We're going to look at this section of the story

471
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,680
 because there are a few details

472
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,800
 which I really feel are important for us to understand

473
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,520
 in order to embrace what Jesus was trying to teach.

474
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
 So walk with me again through it.

475
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,360
 I'm going to try and point them out for us,

476
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,880
 contextualize them a little bit

477
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,560
 so we can embrace this story better.

478
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,040
 The first thing is this, a man.

479
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,600
 It tells us a man was going down.

480
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,360
 Now, Jesus doesn't indicate the background,

481
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,840
 the ethnicity, the social status,

482
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120
 any details about this man.

483
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,240
 The Bible doesn't tell us.

484
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,320
 He is simply a man traveling from one place to another

485
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,080
 when he meets the misfortune of being attacked, robbed,

486
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,880
 and left to die.

487
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,880
 But I think Jesus purposely leaves the details

488
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,840
 out of this man ambiguous because that was his point.

489
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,840
 It shouldn't matter.

490
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,560
 Who cares who this man was?

491
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,880
 Who cares about this man's background?

492
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,960
 Who cares what his social status was?

493
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,360
 Who cares what his ethnicity was?

494
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,480
 What is important, the thing that Jesus is trying to point out

495
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,840
 is that he is suffering and he is in need of help.

496
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,320
 And the question he's asking is,

497
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,000
 "Who is going to help him?

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,560
 Who is going to be a neighbor for this man?"

499
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,360
 Well, how does that translate for us?

500
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,120
 Well, we have to ask ourselves the same question.

501
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,640
 Do we make judgments on the people who we help

502
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
 or we choose to help?

503
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,280
 Are we more likely to help people who are just like us?

504
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,800
 Are we more eager to help those who we know

505
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,760
 will be able to repay us back in some way,

506
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,600
 owe us something so we can call on them

507
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,280
 when we're in need later on?

508
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,280
 Or are we willing to see people simply for who they are?

509
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,440
 Hurting, in pain, victims of injustice,

510
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,600
 in need of someone to step in and help.

511
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,280
 The story also tells us this,

512
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,920
 the path, the geographic location,

513
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,120
 the road going down from Jerusalem to Jericho.

514
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,760
 This is also a very important detail, right?

515
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,360
 This was a downhill road,

516
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,800
 as you probably have heard

517
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,480
 if you've heard this story a few times,

518
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
 from Jerusalem to Jericho.

519
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
 But this was a notoriously dangerous road.

520
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,120
 Many hiding spots for robbers to hide

521
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,360
 and attack unsuspecting travelers.

522
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,000
 And it's a story,

523
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,960
 all three men are traveling from the same direction, right?

524
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
 From Jerusalem down to Jericho.

525
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
 The victim, the priest, and Levite,

526
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
 all traveling on the same road in the same direction.

527
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,200
 And the point is this,

528
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
 actually any of them could have become

529
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,800
 the victim of these robbers.

530
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,840
 It just so happened that the robbers

531
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,840
 chose to attack this man.

532
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,760
 Now what does this speak to us?

533
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,640
 As I was reading this, I was just reminded,

534
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,040
 actually, you know,

535
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,760
 any of us could become victims at any time.

536
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,320
 Any of us could become victims of misfortune

537
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,800
 or injustice at any moment.

538
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,880
 We live in a wild and unpredictable world.

539
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
 And just because things are going right for you

540
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,200
 at this moment,

541
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,680
 it's not guaranteed to stay that way.

542
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
 If you want to hear a few real life stories about that,

543
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,840
 just go and spend some time with our RISE community.

544
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,200
 These were men and women, just like you and me,

545
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,880
 who had homes, who had families, education,

546
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,160
 community, professions, income, living thriving lives,

547
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,600
 but because situations that were out of their control

548
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,520
 found themselves victims and in need of a good neighbor.

549
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,600
 We too, church, need to be mindful of this.

550
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,920
 One day, what if we find ourselves in need?

551
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,160
 Won't we all want a good neighbor to come and help us along

552
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,000
 in our times of help?

553
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,840
 Of course, there's the priest and the Levite.

554
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
 The priest and the Levite,

555
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,920
 two religious leaders of the time.

556
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,240
 These were holy men with high status

557
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,720
 who supposedly knew exactly what it was like

558
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,320
 to carry out God's law.

559
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,080
 They were supposed to be righteous men,

560
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,400
 but neither of them shows even the slightest interest

561
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,440
 in wanting to help.

562
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
 There's a pattern for both of them.

563
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,600
 It says, "They came, they saw, and they passed by."

564
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,000
 They came, they saw, and they passed by.

565
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,280
 Now imagine yourself as a victim of these robbers.

566
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,840
 You're lying there, half dead on the street,

567
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,200
 semi-conscious, and you see two holy men.

568
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
 They would have been recognizable by the way they dress.

569
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,720
 These two righteous men coming towards you,

570
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,040
 it probably would have been a welcome sight.

571
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,520
 "Surely," he would have said, thinking,

572
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
 "these people are here to help me.

573
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,720
 Rescue is here.

574
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,840
 I'm going to be okay."

575
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,360
 Only to have them not come towards you,

576
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,000
 but go out of the way to avoid going anywhere near them.

577
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,320
 Why?

578
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,840
 Why did these guys not stop?

579
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,560
 Now Luke doesn't say,

580
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,600
 and if you read commentaries,

581
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,480
 they come up with a lot of hypothetical reasons

582
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
 why they didn't stop.

583
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,400
 One of the explanations is that

584
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,800
 they were afraid of becoming unclean,

585
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,200
 because Jewish law says that you have to be ceremonially clean

586
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,520
 to participate in temple activities,

587
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
 but that doesn't really make sense,

588
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,760
 because of the way Jesus was telling his story,

589
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,920
 they were going down from Jerusalem.

590
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,400
 In other words, they were clocking off work,

591
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,200
 going back home.

592
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,120
 They didn't need to be clean.

593
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
 So being clean was just an excuse.

594
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
 Some commentators say that they didn't stop to help,

595
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,360
 because they were scared that if they stopped,

596
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,280
 it was a dangerous road, like we said,

597
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,520
 maybe they would have been victims of attack too.

598
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
 Maybe the robbers would have come to them.

599
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,240
 So in order to keep safe, they just kept going.

600
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,320
 Now, as we said,

601
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,380
 excuse me,

602
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,240
 Luke didn't say why they didn't stop.

603
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,480
 If you interviewed these men,

604
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,920
 if there was this real life situation,

605
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,960
 you could sit down with them,

606
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,680
 they probably would have given you 10 different excuses

607
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,400
 of why they couldn't stop to help this man.

608
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,160
 But those would just have been excuses.

609
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,880
 Again, we have to ask ourselves this question.

610
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
 What about us?

611
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,800
 What excuses do we come up with

612
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,960
 when we as believers, as a church,

613
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,000
 fail to help the people around us,

614
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,360
 fail to be the good neighbor that God has called us to be?

615
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,120
 It's too messy.

616
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,640
 It's too dangerous.

617
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,520
 Too many excuses.

618
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,760
 There will always be excuses, church,

619
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,160
 for why we can't be a neighbor.

620
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,920
 Okay, let's bring it back to a Hong Kong context.

621
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,480
 Cantonese speakers, I need your support for a moment.

622
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,600
 If you don't speak Cantonese,

623
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,920
 I'm going to give you a very quick Cantonese lesson,

624
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,400
 some basic Cantonese phrases.

625
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,800
 But I think this will highlight what I'm trying to say.

626
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,240
 There's a Cantonese term called "fongbi".

627
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,400
 "Fongbi" is Cantonese for "convenience".

628
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
 It's the opposite of "mafan".

629
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
 Everybody knows "mafan", right?

630
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,960
 "Fongbi" is the opposite of "mafan".

631
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,240
 Now, we live in a very fast-paced city.

632
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,720
 We are deathly afraid of being inconvenienced as Hong Kongers.

633
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,800
 Look at the amount of 7-Elevens they are.

634
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,960
 Just in this area alone, there's like six 7-Elevens

635
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,880
 within like 100 meters of each other.

636
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,400
 We want homes close to the MTR,

637
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
 but also close to our kids' school.

638
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,160
 We want supermarkets close to us.

639
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,680
 We want the wet market close to us.

640
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,800
 We want good options for food everywhere we go.

641
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
 We want fast public transport.

642
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,400
 Whenever something threatens our convenience,

643
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,600
 we say, "Oh, that's too "mafan"", and we shrink back.

644
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,760
 It's too out of the way.

645
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
 It's going to take too long.

646
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,480
 Basically, if anything is not "fongbi",

647
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,520
 we don't want to do it.

648
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,720
 Another term is this, "wun bun".

649
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,700
 Okay?

650
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,720
 "Wun bun" can be roughly translated as "to be tricked" or "to be fooled",

651
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,440
 which of course can cause us to lose face.

652
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,320
 Hong Kongers, we as Hong Kongers are afraid of "to be wun bun", right?

653
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,760
 We feel this, and this makes us suspicious before we help each other, doesn't it?

654
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,760
 I mean, we ask ourselves a question, "Does this person even need help?"

655
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
 "Kun me wun o bun, yeah?"

656
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,720
 Right?

657
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,000
 "Does this person even need help, or are they just trying to con me?"

658
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,320
 Like, if I actually help this person, am I going to get embarrassed afterwards?

659
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,640
 Where is it going to end me, helping this person?

660
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,520
 We're afraid of it, so we don't go near it.

661
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,480
 Finally, there's a term, "sit dai".

662
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,200
 Okay?

663
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,880
 "Sit dai" means "to take a loss", "to be taken advantage of".

664
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,680
 Again, if we want to help someone, we often ask ourselves this question, don't we?

665
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,080
 "How much is it going to cost me?"

666
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,640
 "Is this person taking advantage of me?"

667
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,800
 "Am I going to lose a lot?"

668
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,240
 "What am I going to gain if I give this person resources?"

669
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
 "What's he going to give back to me?"

670
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,480
 "If I don't get anything back, ho sit dai wo", right?

671
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,480
 Do you see, Church, how these questions and these suspicions

672
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,640
 build further walls between us and people in our communities?

673
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,000
 Do you see how these things are so damaging for the relationships we have with each other?

674
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,160
 Let me remind us, Church, Jesus has not called his followers to live this way.

675
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,680
 We haven't been called to live safe, comfortable lives

676
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,760
 where we just wait and die and get to heaven.

677
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,440
 But we have been called to reach out courageously,

678
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,840
 to practice empathy, to love sacrificially.

679
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,640
 This is exactly what we see the Samaritan do.

680
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,240
 Now, the Samaritan man that comes along,

681
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,080
 you don't need to tell me, you don't need to be reminded of this,

682
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,800
 but the Samaritans and Jews did not get along.

683
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,400
 And to this day, it's a very sad conflict that's lasted thousands and thousands of years.

684
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,640
 And in the context of this story, Jesus introducing a Samaritan man as the hero

685
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,800
 would have been shocking to the law and to the expert in the law

686
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,040
 and anyone else who was listening at the time.

687
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,400
 The hated Samaritan would have been the last person this law expert

688
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,440
 would have been expected to be the good guy of this story.

689
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,680
 But that's not even the main difference that Jesus wants to highlight.

690
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,920
 Not that fact that he was a Samaritan and they were Jews.

691
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,960
 This is the main thing Jesus is trying to highlight,

692
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,440
 where the priest and the Levite came, saw, and crossed over to the other side.

693
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,800
 The Samaritan man came, saw, was moved with compassion,

694
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,000
 went to the wounded man and cared for him.

695
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,760
 This is the true distinction between the Samaritan and the other two.

696
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,280
 Not that they were Jewish and he was Samaritan, like I said.

697
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,040
 Not that they had high status and were unsure what kind of status the Samaritan had.

698
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,320
 What individualizes him is his compassion leading to action

699
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,080
 compared to their lack of care and total inaction.

700
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:34,000
 In terms of Hong Kong practicality, this Samaritan man did all the wrong things.

701
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,040
 He goes out of his way on the dangerous road, makes himself vulnerable to attack.

702
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,040
 He uses his own resources, his oil and his wine,

703
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,760
 expensive, precious resources to heal this man.

704
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,720
 Takes him to an inn, uses his own money,

705
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,680
 creates an open account to pay whatever extra charges that might be racked up.

706
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,400
 He had no idea who he was helping.

707
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,120
 He had no idea how far he was going to have to go.

708
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,160
 And he helps without any expectation of being paid back.

709
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,320
 This was "hòu mfāngbīn".

710
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
 This was "sītdai" and this was "wǎnbàn", all in one scenario.

711
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,920
 But he does it all in the name of being a good neighbor.

712
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,640
 And my brothers and sisters, this is the kind of church that Jesus has called us to be.

713
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,040
 This is the way we remedy the broken relationships we see around us.

714
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,440
 This is what a true neighbor looks like.

715
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,640
 Listen to what Jesus says.

716
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,880
 "Which of these three you think was a neighbor to the man

717
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,560
 who fell into the hands of the robbers?

718
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,440
 The expert of the law replied, 'The one who had mercy on him.'

719
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,880
 Jesus said, 'Go and do likewise.'"

720
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,080
 So this is the truth, church.

721
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,560
 Our city desperately needs the people of God.

722
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,920
 Desperately needs the church to be willing to show compassion and mercy to those around us.

723
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,560
 We are in need of genuine, loving relationships again.

724
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,760
 And we cannot be content with excuses and reasons not to reach out,

725
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,240
 bandage the wounds, and go the extra mile for those around us.

726
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,040
 We need to be the good neighbors of the city.

727
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,160
 And it's going to take more than church attendance

728
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,640
 and community groups and singing songs on a Sunday.

729
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,280
 It's going to take for us, collectively, to sacrifice ourselves,

730
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,640
 sacrifice our resources, sacrifice our convenience,

731
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,720
 sacrifice our comfort zones in order to be the good neighbor Jesus has called us to be.

732
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,680
 And some of these different wounds, some of these different ways relationships are broken down,

733
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,240
 are going to be exactly what we're going to be addressing in the next few weeks.

734
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,560
 So today, take it as a sort of a wake-up call.

735
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,920
 Take it as sort of a catalyst to remind ourselves, to open our eyes.

736
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,000
 Actually, you know what?

737
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,200
 Yes, there is a lot of brokenness around us.

738
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,760
 There might even still be a lot of brokenness in me.

739
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,920
 But I'm not content to sit on the side anymore.

740
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,680
 I'm not content to see what's happening and cross by the other side and go about my life.

741
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,480
 I want to engage with what God's doing.

742
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,440
 I want to follow this challenge that Jesus sets for us to go and do likewise.

743
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:42,720
 So church, I pray that as brothers and sisters, we go and love our people.

744
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,680
 We go and be the good neighbors that Jesus has called us to be.

745
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,720
 Let's rise up to this challenge together.

746
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,400
 Would you stand?

747
00:38:52,400 --> 00:39:02,240
 Everyone, I'm going to pray for us.

748
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,560
 Yeah, Jesus, we just give you a moment now to speak to our hearts.

749
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:30,720
 Father, relationships are an essential part of life.

750
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,360
 That's how you created us, to be in community with each other.

751
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:45,040
 Which is why when relationships are suffering, Lord, our whole being suffers.

752
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:53,760
 And our hearts might be breaking right now.

753
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:02,880
 Maybe as you think about relationships or someone's out there, you're thinking to yourself,

754
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,280
 "Man, there's so much brokenness already in my own heart, in my own relationships.

755
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,320
 How can I help others when I'm broken myself?"

756
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:26,400
 For some of you, you might look out there and say, "Wow, yeah, I hear what you're saying.

757
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,160
 Theoretically, it sounds good, but what difference can I make?

758
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,280
 I'm just one person."

759
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,480
 The problem is huge.

760
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,080
 It's so embedded in culture.

761
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,440
 For some of us, you might be doing, "I've been trying this already.

762
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,320
 I've been trying, but every time I do it, nothing works.

763
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,720
 Things might even seem to be getting worse."

764
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:06,240
 But Jesus, you demonstrated the ultimate sacrifice in order to teach us

765
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,640
 what true relationship is, true reconciliation is, true healing looks like.

766
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,760
 And that starts when we only find it in you first.

767
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:32,960
 And Jesus, I thank you for the example that you set for us, that you continue to set for us.

768
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,360
 So first, Lord, I pray for healing for people in this room,

769
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,720
 for those who are hurting in their relationships.

770
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,760
 May they find peace.

771
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:54,400
 May they find healthy reconciliation, healthy process to address the pain and the hurt that

772
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,080
 they have suffered, and you meet them where they are with your love.

773
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:08,240
 But as we look ahead, Father, help us to walk hand in hand to rise up to this challenge.

774
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,080
 As we look at the world around us, as we look at our families, our society, our workplaces,

775
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:24,400
 our schools, even if it's just, you know, like on public transport, there's always

776
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,160
 opportunities to show your kindness, to start making small steps towards

777
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,320
 relating to people as you've called us to do so.

778
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:48,880
 So Holy Spirit, come, empower us, embolden us, help us like the Samaritan to go,

779
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:59,840
 to reach out, not giving any excuses, but simply to love as you've called us to love.

780
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,360
 Thank you, Jesus.

781
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,400
 We pray in your name.

782
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:16,400
 Amen.
