[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420]   All right, church, we move into the portion of our service where we're going to hear the
[00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.420]   word.
[00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.080]   We are starting a brand new series this week called Parables.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.000]   We're going to be looking at these stories that Jesus told, and kicking this off will
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   be Pastor Ellison.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.960]   Pastor Ellison, come on up here.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.140]   I just want to show the church, I want to clarify.
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.040]   I woke up first this morning because I have a newborn.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.360]   I put this on first.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.320]   I just, I want to be...
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.880]   No, no, this is what friends do, right?
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880]   We match.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.360]   And actually, Michelle is also wearing the same thing, so maybe it's a pastoral team
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.360]   thing.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.360]   All right, we're going to pray one more time because we're a church.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360]   You can never have enough praying.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.360]   Go ahead and stretch out your arms to Ellison.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360]   We're just going to pray for him.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.280]   Father, we thank you this morning for Ellison, for this man of God, and for the word that
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.960]   you've put on his heart for the study.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.680]   And just, God, that you would be with him as he speaks.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.440]   God, give him your spirit to lead and guide him.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.000]   God, we pray for us.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.160]   We pray for our hearts to be open to hearing from you, God, and we give you glory for what
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.720]   you're about to do in this sermon.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.720]   So, in your name we pray.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   Amen.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.720]   Amen.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.480]   I promise I didn't tell you, him and I are also remaking Rush Hour 4 soon, so that's
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.440]   what's really going on, okay?
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.960]   Well, good morning.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.320]   It's good to be here, as always, and an honor to start a new sermon series together.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.800]   I want to tell you a story, another story, before we start.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.000]   So before I became, joined Full-Time Ministry, I used to be a kindergarten teacher.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.680]   And so as a kindergarten teacher, of course, we told a lot of stories, story time, circle
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.120]   time with our children.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.800]   And so I'm going to tell you one of the favorite stories I used to share with my kindergarten
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800]   class, okay?
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.200]   It's called "Tadpole's Promise."
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.280]   All right, so crisscross applesauce, if everyone's sitting comfortably, I'm going to tell you
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.040]   a story.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.160]   Once upon a time, on the edge of a beautiful pond, where the willow met the bay, lived
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.620]   a beautiful tadpole and a caterpillar.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.120]   They were best friends, the tadpole and the caterpillar, and were deeply in love with
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.800]   each other.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.440]   The tadpole would call the caterpillar his beautiful rainbow, and the caterpillar would
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.520]   call the tadpole her beautiful black pearl.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.480]   "I love everything about you," the caterpillar would say to the tadpole.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.800]   "You are my beautiful black pearl.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000]   Promise me you'll never, ever change."
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And the tadpole said, "I promise, I promise you that I will never change."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.200]   But the next time they met, the tadpole had grown two little legs, and the caterpillar
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   was heartbroken.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.220]   "You broke your promise to me, tadpole.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.440]   You said you would never change, but now you have legs."
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.800]   And the tadpole said to the caterpillar, "I'm sorry, I don't want these legs at all.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.720]   All I want is my beautiful rainbow."
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.760]   And so the caterpillar said, "Okay, I'll forgive you, but promise me you will not change
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.160]   anymore."
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.440]   And the tadpole, "I promise, I promise you I will not change."
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   But sure enough, the next time they met, the tadpole changed again.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.560]   He had arms, then he had lost his tail, and each time he would make a promise not to change,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.080]   he could never keep his promise.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.300]   He kept on changing.
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.760]   And so in the end, the caterpillar said to him, "You have broken my heart too many times,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760]   tadpole.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.960]   You are not my shiny black pearl anymore."
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.920]   The tadpole thought to himself, "But you will always be my beautiful rainbow.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.360]   I'm sorry, you've changed too much.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.520]   I never want to see you again."
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.600]   And with that, the caterpillar crawled up onto the highest branch she could find, and
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.560]   she cried and cried.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.880]   She cried so hard and so long that she formed a cocoon around her and fell asleep for a
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.920]   very long time.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.960]   Now some time passed, and when the caterpillar woke up, everything had changed.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.400]   She was now a butterfly with beautiful wings.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.680]   The season had changed.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.840]   The sun was shining.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.880]   The grass was green.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.260]   The flowers had bloomed.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.260]   But what didn't change was what she had in her heart for her shiny black pearl.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.040]   And so she decided to fly down to the river to find him and to forgive him.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.520]   And as she flew down to the river, a frog was sitting on the lily pad.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.360]   "Excuse me, Mr. Frog, have you seen my..."
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.680]   But before she could say "beautiful black pearl," the frog jumped up and ate up the
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.440]   butterfly in one big gulp.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.200]   Emotional damage, wow.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.220]   What a story.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.940]   But what a story, right?
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.700]   In those two minutes, we went on a rollercoaster of emotions.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   You guys were listening.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.440]   There was love, friendship, cuteness, heartbreak, shock, and horror.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   You were drawn in.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.380]   You were listening to the story.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.380]   Why?
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.680]   Because stories carry power.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.100]   Stories are powerful, which is often why when people want to teach something or explain
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.060]   something, they do so through stories.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.300]   We have not just this story, fairy tales, countless fairy tales.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.860]   These cute little stories would often have a deeper meaning behind them.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.660]   And Jesus knew this.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.940]   In fact, a lot of how Jesus taught, Jesus chose to teach through stories because he
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.840]   knew they had power.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.580]   And the stories Jesus told are known as parables.
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.840]   And if you read through the gospels in the Matthew, Mark, and Luke, Jesus taught through
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.340]   these parables to draw people in, to get them invested, but to make them think about truths,
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.680]   truths about his message, truths about the kingdom of heaven, and to declare him who
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.580]   he was and the character of God.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.540]   These parables, as people heard them, invited hearers into a new reality that Jesus was
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.520]   trying to open their eyes to, the fact that the kingdom of heaven is surely but slowly
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.860]   taking over this earth.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.540]   But the difference is that Jesus' stories weren't just supposed to be like cute little
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.220]   tales that he told with a little moral truth.
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.180]   They were actually meant to shock and to shake our world.
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.700]   In fact, one of the reasons why Jesus had to use parables to teach was because some
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.980]   of the things he was talking about were so countercultural, so shocking, and so different
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.300]   from what other people were saying that if he had said it directly, people would have
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.580]   arrested him straight away.
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.940]   Which is why people told, Jesus told parables and stories.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:50.260]   But then it's also why then he had to explain them, tell them what is this story really
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.060]   about, again, because they were so powerful and so dangerous.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.060]   He had to veil them with a story, but then he would go on and explain the truth of them.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:06.820]   And these stories, even though they're over 2,000 years old, still ring true today.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.540]   So like Promise told us earlier, over the next four weeks, we're going to look at some
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.460]   of these beloved stories of Jesus.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.620]   And together we're going to study them, we're going to wrestle with them, and we're going
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.620]   to ask ourselves how these ancient stories continue to speak truth into our life and
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.820]   our journey with Jesus today.
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.860]   It's going to be good, I really hope so.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.180]   And today we're going to start with the parable of the sower.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.820]   The parable of the sower.
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.580]   Now do you guys remember what chia pets were?
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.660]   Are they still around?
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.660]   Chia pets, right?
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.740]   Chia pets were like these potato-looking lump, okay, that you soak them in some water and
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.460]   you water them and then you put them against a windowsill.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.300]   Or maybe that's the first science experiment, some of you guys did get that little seed,
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.660]   right, and put it in the cotton, and then sure enough, after some time, the seed sprout
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:03.220]   or the chia seed grows green hair and that's how they grow, that's how things work, right?
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.220]   Seeds are meant to bear fruit.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.740]   Seeds grow, that's what they're supposed to do.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.700]   In fact, it's all in a part of God's design of how he created this world to work.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:22.340]   On the third day of creation, God said, "Let the land produce vegetation, seed-bearing
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:29.420]   plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it according to the various kinds."
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.380]   So seeds are supposed to grow, seeds are supposed to bear fruit.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:40.380]   But in order for seeds to grow and to bear fruit, they need good soil.
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:45.220]   In fact, you could even say that soil and fruit-bearing seeds are essential for our
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.620]   survival as humans on this earth.
[00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.400]   Maybe it's not something we think about all the time, but next time you go into a supermarket
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.820]   or something, you're at a parking shop or welcome or whatever, take a look at all the
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.900]   products, right, or when you go to the wet market.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.420]   There's fruits, there's vegetables, now they're all neatly laid in front of us, you know,
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.620]   we can just go and buy them and bring them home and prepare our meals and stuff.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.540]   But think a bit further sometimes.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.540]   Where did this stuff come from?
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.660]   The shelves that are fully well-stacked with products, it's easy to forget that all this
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:23.980]   is actually a produce of farming, of agriculture, where seeds had to be planted, were sown into
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.780]   soil and then these seeds bear fruit that becomes our food, or it's the food our food
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.260]   eats sometimes, right?
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:36.740]   The entire world is reliant on seed and good soil.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.740]   In fact, I wrote a little poem, a little haiku, okay, to describe this.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.780]   Listen, if the soil is bad, the seeds do not bear us food.
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.780]   Without food, we die.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.140]   All right, it's to the point, shortened to the point.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.500]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:01.300]   Now, like I said, for us, you know, we're a bit detached from this reality, but the
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.340]   realities and difficulties in agriculture were a lot more obvious for the people in
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.500]   Jesus' time.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.820]   They would have understood immediately the importance of good farming and seeds that
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:19.080]   produce a fruit, which is perhaps why often Jesus used farming and agriculture as a way
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.180]   to illustrate his point, right?
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.820]   Seeds and conditions of soil and what bears fruit, what doesn't bear fruit.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.220]   And so this is the heart behind Jesus' parable.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.940]   So we're about to read it and then after that, we're going to walk through the parable
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.300]   to learn what Jesus has to say about his kingdom through this story.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.660]   It starts in Luke 8, verse 1.
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:47.540]   It says this, "After this, Jesus traveled from one town and village to another, proclaiming
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.380]   the good news of the kingdom of God.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:56.220]   The twelve were with him, and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases.
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.540]   Mary called Magdalene, whom had seven demons had come out.
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:05.280]   Jonah, the wife of Huzah, the manager of Herod's household, Susanna, and many others.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.800]   These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.460]   While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town,
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.500]   he told this parable.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.960]   A farmer went out to sow a seed.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.860]   As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.920]   It was trampled on and birds ate it up.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.900]   Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.900]   moisture.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.820]   Other seeds fell among thorns which grew up with it and choked the plants.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.260]   Still, other seeds fell on good soil.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:43.100]   It came up and yielded a crop a hundred times more than was sown."
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.260]   Now on the surface, it seems like a pretty straightforward story.
[00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:53.420]   A farmer goes out, does his thing, sows his seeds with various results.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.900]   But when we think about it, when we look a bit deeper, there are some unusual elements
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.500]   to this story.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.780]   Firstly, the method of planting seed, the method the farmer used, was a bit unusual.
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:11.020]   Normally care was taken to make sure that seed wasn't just scattered.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.780]   The name for doing this in farming is called broadcasting.
[00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.580]   So normally, farmers wouldn't just scatter seed all over the place.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:23.220]   But rather, usually, intention was taken to put seeds in a place where it had the best
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.620]   chance to grow.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.760]   Remember also, Jesus started by saying, "I'm talking about the good news of the kingdom
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.160]   of God."
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.900]   So within this context, people were listening to this story thinking, "Well, what do seeds
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.020]   and birds and thorns and hard ground, all that kind of stuff, have to do?
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.020]   What does that have to do with God's kingdom?"
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.780]   Now here's what's important for us today.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.500]   You have just heard this parable.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.620]   You've heard the story, it's drawn you in.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.120]   Maybe as I was reading, you had pictures of farmers throwing seed everywhere, pictures
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.800]   of seed landing in different types of ground.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.060]   But with listening to what we're about to say, we're going to talk about the explanation.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:13.580]   And so in listening to explanation, there is also going to come expectation and responsibility.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:19.900]   This is why Jesus says, "Whoever has ears, let them hear."
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.700]   His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:28.180]   He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of kingdom of God has been given to you."
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:34.140]   And so we are going to look into these secrets of the kingdom of God, explanation that Jesus
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.140]   has given to us.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.060]   We're about to get into the meaning of this parable.
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.660]   If you have ears today, you're about to hear.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:48.180]   You're going to see and you're going to understand, hopefully, what Jesus is trying to teach us.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:54.280]   Now but like I said, this comes with expectation and responsibility.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.220]   But because you're about to hear, you're about to see and understand, this is going to change,
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.040]   it should change your world.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.420]   Because we're talking about understanding God's heart and His kingdom.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.220]   And it's going to challenge us to do something with the message, with the seed we're about
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.660]   to hear today.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:19.020]   We're talking about revealing secrets of God's kingdom.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:25.660]   Once you've seen, once you've heard, once you've understood, you have no excuse.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.860]   And so what I'm saying right now is if you don't want that responsibility, maybe it's
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.300]   best for you can put in some air pods right now, okay?
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.340]   I won't even be offended if you go downstairs to PCC, grab a coffee or something.
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.260]   It's half-price coffee today, by the way, right?
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.300]   Because Hong Kong won the gold medal, right?
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.460]   So yeah, congratulations, Hong Kong.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.560]   Amazing.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.060]   But honestly, if you wanted to leave right now, I wouldn't be offended.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.700]   But I hope you will stay.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.780]   Because what I've said, through understanding these parables, we're going to get to know
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:05.520]   more about who Jesus is and how He's called us to live.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.880]   And this is what being a follower of Jesus is all about, isn't it?
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.560]   This is what our lives should be about.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.020]   So if you're ready, let's hear the explanation.
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.560]   Well, Jesus says it Himself.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.520]   This is the meaning of the parable.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.740]   The seed is the Word of God.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.560]   The seed is the Word of God.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.560]   So there's our first reveal.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.800]   It seems that this is a teaching about how God's Word works in the different types of
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.520]   soil.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.520]   Now notice this, though.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:44.060]   The interesting thing is that throughout the story, the seed is the only consistent thing.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.840]   The seed is consistent.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.240]   The soil changes, but the seed never changes.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.400]   As it says in Scripture, "The grass withers, the flowers fell, but the Word of God endures
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.480]   forever."
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.200]   Now the way the farmer is sowing the seed is through scattering.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.060]   Like I said just now, scattering was an unusual practice because it was seen as wasteful.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.960]   In a time where food was scarce and needed to be grown properly, you wouldn't want to
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.800]   waste your seed like that.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.280]   The seed was a precious commodity for the farmer.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.520]   So the usual practice would be to make sure the seeds were put in places where they had
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.760]   potential for growth.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.480]   So why the scattering of the seed?
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.720]   Why is Jesus telling the story this way?
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.520]   Well, I think what He's trying to tell us is this, that the scattering of seed—remember,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.280]   the seed represents God's Word—the scattering of the seed highlights the fact that the Word
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.320]   of God is everywhere and for everyone.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.960]   There is an unusual sense of generosity about how the farmer is scattering his seed.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.800]   There's almost like a joy about it.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.160]   You can almost picture him doing, "Yeah, I'm just going to spread it everywhere.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.400]   It doesn't matter where it lands.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.200]   My aim is to spread it as far and wide as I possibly can."
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.360]   He's not eking our living, being really stingy with the seed.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.520]   He's not thinking about the seed running out because He knows there is more than enough.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.940]   It will never run out.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.360]   This is what Jesus is trying to say.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.160]   He's trying to say that God's Word is abundant.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   And God's heart, His desire is for everyone to be able to encounter it, to be able to
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.760]   hear it.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:30.240]   God's desire is that nobody shall perish, but everyone has a chance of hearing His Word.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.600]   And what do we know about His Word?
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.840]   His Word is powerful.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.120]   The seed carries with it the potential for growth.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.180]   The potential of God's Word that we carry is also the truth of His love, His salvation,
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.520]   and the great potential to bear fruit.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.720]   Disciples making more disciples.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.760]   But see, this is what happens.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:58.160]   What happens to the seed, though, depends on the condition of the soil it lands in.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.720]   And there's a few different types of soil.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.960]   The first one is this.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.120]   "Those along the path are the ones who hear."
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.740]   And then the devil comes and takes away the Word from their hearts so that they may not
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.640]   believe and be saved.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.320]   Okay, so this is the second reveal.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:21.440]   The seed is God's Word, and the soil represents people and the condition of our hearts.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.240]   And so for the seed that falls along the path, it tells us it's trampled on, and the devil
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.120]   snatches the Word away.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.200]   This devil snatches the rest of the seeds away.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.080]   It's important to notice, though, that these people have heard God's Word.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.080]   It's not the hearing that they've heard God's Word.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.400]   The problem is that they don't put their belief in God, and so they don't receive salvation.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   They're not saved.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.000]   They don't believe, therefore they're not saved.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.360]   The heart that is hard, a hard heart, will never be able to receive God's Word.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.480]   In addition to this, we have an enemy, like we said a couple of weeks ago, that is actively
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.980]   trying to stop the Word of God from taking root and bearing fruit in people's hearts.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:17.280]   The enemy's aim is the complete opposite of what God is trying to do.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.840]   Now again, notice, it's not God that stops the seed from taking root.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.040]   It's the hardness of the path.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.000]   It's the bird that snatches it away.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.660]   And Jesus is not shy in telling us the consequences of a hardened heart.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.240]   Because the heart is hard and does not believe, these people are not saved, so that they may
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.800]   not be saved, meaning they are not rescued and brought out of the consequences of sin
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.200]   and darkness.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   They do not have the life now and the eternal life that Jesus promises for those who follow
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960]   them.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.520]   Now, if you look back at the story of Luke, until this point, Jesus has actually met a
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.200]   bunch of people with hard hearts.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.280]   People like the Pharisees and the religious leaders who refused to listen to Jesus.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:12.600]   The villagers in his own hometown of Nazareth who drove Jesus out and even tried to throw
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.740]   him off a cliff and kill him.
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:24.440]   The hardened heart will always reject Jesus and the life and salvation only he can provide.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.340]   So here's the question today as you're listening.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.760]   Has your heart been hardened?
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:39.280]   Jesus tells us, "If you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:43.160]   And one of the first things I want to say this morning is that for those of you who
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:49.480]   have heard God's word but not yet let it sink into your hearts, I really urge you today
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.080]   to really, really consider this question.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.440]   Have you let the word of God sink into your hearts?
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:02.120]   Have you received it and not just heard it, but received it and started to put your belief
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.600]   in it?
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.600]   Because if you haven't, the consequences is literally one of eternal life with Jesus or
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   eternal separation from him in darkness.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   So that's the hard heart.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.400]   But there's also those on the rocky ground.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.760]   These are the ones that receive God's word with joy when they hear, but they have no
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.760]   root.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:32.200]   They believe for a little while, but in the time of testing, they fall away.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   So the second group of people are called the rocky ground.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.840]   Like we're saying, the seed will grow, but only if the conditions are right.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:47.720]   And so in the same way, unless God's word actually takes root in your heart, it will
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.400]   not be long lasting.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.560]   It's like getting a gym membership at the customer New Year, going for a few weeks and
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.160]   giving it up again.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.560]   Or like the instrument that you swore you'd pick up and practice every day, but now the
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.320]   guitar just sits in the corner gathering dust and you don't know it's out of tune.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.280]   You don't know what to do with it anymore.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.480]   The same thing happens when it comes to our faith.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.560]   Receiving God's word is an exciting moment.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.360]   Maybe even getting baptized, that moment is so exciting.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.600]   Think back to a time when you first put your faith in Jesus.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.920]   Joy is such a perfect word to describe that moment.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.880]   The hope that you felt, no troubles of this world have finally been lifted.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.040]   Yes, I believe in Jesus now.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   Everything's going to be okay.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   I feel great.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:43.640]   But then the adrenaline wears off and the moment passes and the reality of life starts to hit
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.120]   you again.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:51.600]   You start to face struggle and testing and then your faith, you find sometimes, begins
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.200]   to shrink.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.800]   This is a word for us in this room because there is a danger that this could be us.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.480]   This could be us in this room today and we do not want to be in this category.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.520]   Most of us in this room, the majority of us, have received God's word.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.000]   We might not even have been believing in it for a while.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.320]   The question is, has it taken root in your heart?
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:24.240]   Because if it has not, Jesus says, when testing comes, you will fall away and falling away
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.160]   from your faith is as though you never believed in the first place.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:36.560]   The consequences of people in this category are the same as those with a hard heart.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:42.920]   Now this perhaps is one of the most difficult truths about following Jesus.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   Following Jesus does not automatically make life easier.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   A relationship with Jesus is not a magic pill to take away life's problems.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:02.600]   In fact, many times, believing in Jesus will bring testing into your life.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.080]   And testing comes in different forms, right?
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:12.600]   Sometimes it comes from temptations, the desires of the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.680]   of the eyes, the pride of life as Scripture describes it.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:23.280]   And when these things come knocking on your door, when they come to test you, we give
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.000]   in when God's word hasn't fully taken root in our lives.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:36.680]   Despite the moment of joy that we felt, the temptations overwhelm us and we fall away.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.760]   Sometimes though, this testing is even orchestrated by God.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.800]   Scripture also tells us very clearly, "Because the Lord disciplines the one he loves and
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.400]   he chastens everyone he accepts as his son."
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.560]   But this is the kind of testing that is designed to refine us, to burn away and cut away things
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:03.720]   of our life that are not of him, that are not of Christ, so that we can live more like
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.640]   Jesus.
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.480]   But sometimes when these testing comes too, we reject them, we resent them, we refuse
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   to believe and we refuse to be changed and disciplined and discipled.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.520]   And so we too fall away.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.400]   But Jesus is asking too much, like Jethro was praying just now.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.760]   He's demanding too much of my life.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:33.400]   Only a heart that is deeply rooted in the Lord will withstand all the testing of life.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.640]   And we need to be sure that we're not just fair-weather Christians because there is no
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.920]   such thing.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.240]   Faith that only appears for a short time is no faith at all.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.360]   Church, this is a warning, this is a pleading.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.920]   Do not abandon the love that you first had.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.560]   We don't want to be like dogs that return to their own vomit.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.860]   We are called to be a people that endures and endures to the end.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.460]   We are called to have a joy in our hearts that is there to stay no matter what comes.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:16.680]   And for this to happen, the root of God's word must set in your heart.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.620]   Now there's another group of people.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.440]   This is the seed that falls among the thorns.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.860]   And these stands for those who hear, but as they go on the way, they are choked up by
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.000]   life's worries and riches and pleasures.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.540]   And so they do not mature.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.200]   The third group of people are likened, and their hearts are likened to seed that grows
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.280]   up amongst the thorns.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.120]   The thorns of life's worries, riches, and pleasures.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.720]   And just like the seed before, there is some growth, but this growth is stunted.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.460]   It's like an arrested development of these seeds.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:57.120]   They are stunted because of the things of this world.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.420]   Now you don't need me to tell you, but the worries in this life are plenty.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.080]   We want to put on a brave face all the time.
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.820]   We want to walk around and appear as though as nothing has happened.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:12.380]   Everything is fine, but life is full of worries.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.440]   In this season, I can testify, I'll say to you right now, worrying is probably one of
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.900]   the biggest struggles right now.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:24.200]   I worry for, my worries look like these days, for my family about able to afford sending
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.220]   our children to school, pay the school fees.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.340]   School bills are expensive.
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.980]   Schooling in Hong Kong can be expensive.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.380]   Whilst trying to save money, whilst trying to save for retirement, put food on the table,
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.180]   pay the rent, all this kind of stuff.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.200]   This kind of stuff keeps me up at night sometimes.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:46.140]   At the same time, my two sons have a genetic condition inherited from me that requires
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.220]   constant, it's a long-term thing for the rest of their lives.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.220]   They're going to have to have doctor's visits and observation.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.620]   Day to day, they're doing fine, but it's a worry because each and every doctor visit
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.880]   we have, I never know what the doctor is going to say.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.660]   Some of these doctor visits have been great, oh yeah, he's doing fine.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.860]   Some of these doctor visits have been like, ooh, what's that?
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.060]   We've got to keep an eye on that.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.380]   And those things worry me.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:12.940]   That's a reality in my life.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:18.300]   I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't worried about these things.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.620]   What about you, though?
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:24.140]   What are some of the worries, things that keep you up at night?
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:29.220]   Do you ever feel these are in danger of arresting your faith in Jesus?
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.740]   All right, well, I have the answer.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.300]   What do we do when we worry?
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.500]   Just pray more.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.160]   Just pray more and everything will be fine.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.300]   You just pray, ask God to take out these worries and take them all away, and then pray for
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.840]   blessings, riches, and pleasures.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.980]   And when you have those things, then everything will be fine and your faith in God will be
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:49.980]   great.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:55.560]   Now, the interesting thing about this part is that riches and pleasures are also included
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.340]   in the list of things that can choke out your relationship with God.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.260]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.880]   Proponents of the prosperity of gospel will certainly have you believe that riches and
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.420]   pleasures are always what God wants to lavish on us.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.680]   And can God bless us in this way?
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.380]   And has he blessed us before in this way?
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.380]   Absolutely.
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:22.820]   But beware, we see the problem of worry, but there is also the problem of pleasure.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.620]   And it works itself out in two ways.
[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:28.620]   Firstly, we might spend all our time just chasing pleasure.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.460]   That's all we ever pray about when we talk to God.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:35.700]   We want God to bless us, take away our troubles, take away our worries, give us the most comfortable
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.580]   life that we can have, the least amount of pain, the most amount of resources.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.940]   And we only go to God when we're seeking these things.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.940]   He becomes like an endorphin hit, like a pleasure machine, like a slot machine that we put our
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940]   hope in.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.620]   "Please God, give me a healing now.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:51.940]   Oh no, not this time.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:52.940]   Okay."
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.260]   And we keep on pulling that lever.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:59.780]   And when we don't get the pleasures, our faith falls away and it doesn't grow.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.900]   Or on the other hand, some of us have these things, we're living that life, and our life
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:09.740]   has become so sufficient and so self-sustaining and resourceful, we don't even think about
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.740]   God anymore.
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:15.980]   Or everything we need, everything we have, I can get, I have access to.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.740]   And our lives become like the rich young ruler.
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.540]   "Oh, I want to follow you, Jesus."
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.220]   And Jesus challenges the rich young ruler.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:26.180]   "Well, okay, give up all your stuff and then you can come and follow me."
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.780]   And in the end, he doesn't.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.660]   He can't take Jesus intruding into his life.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.140]   And we don't want to be the ones to have to sacrifice our pleasures in order to follow
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.420]   Jesus.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.420]   And the consequences are the same.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.940]   Our faith doesn't mature.
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.860]   It doesn't mature because we want Jesus on our own terms.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.740]   And we're either constantly distracted by worries or we're constantly distracted by
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.700]   the riches and pleasure.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:00.260]   And look, in the end, with these people, there isn't even a mention of faith whatsoever.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.780]   There is no faith.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:10.940]   Church, I pray that as a body, as believers, as followers, we will not get choked out by
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.240]   the realities of life.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.340]   And the one thing I'm working on in this area, the thing I feel like keeps me grounded and
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.860]   closest to Jesus in this time when I'm worried about things or things of this life overwhelm
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:31.700]   me or when things get a bit too comfortable, is the word contentment.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.940]   Like Paul says, "I have known what it's like to have little.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:39.860]   I have known what it's like to have more than enough.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.900]   But in every situation, I am content.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.860]   I can do all things in Christ who gives me strength."
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:51.740]   It's like Paul saying to, begging Jesus, "Jesus, please take this thorn away from my flesh."
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.540]   Three times he begs and three times Jesus says no.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.900]   Instead, he responds, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.540]   And that was enough for Paul.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:08.420]   Contentment is how we keep ourselves close to Jesus, to keep our faith nurtured, to keep
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.260]   God's word rooted in our hearts when we're faced with the worries and the pleasures of
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.380]   life.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.420]   No good news so far, right?
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.420]   It's been a bit heavy.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.580]   I understand that.
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.140]   It's coming.
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:29.120]   These soils, because, have not allowed the seed to do what it was supposed to do, which
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.540]   is to grow, to mature, to take root, and to bear fruit.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.700]   In other words, I think what Jesus is trying to say is, if your life and your heart represent
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:45.140]   soil that is hard or is rootless or gets choked out, you have not yet really truly stepped
[00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.180]   into a relationship with me.
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:51.900]   Because if you had, this is what life would be like.
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:56.100]   This is the kind of heart, this is the kind of people that Jesus is looking for.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:03.340]   The seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart who hear the word,
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.540]   retain it, and by persevering, produce a crop.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.120]   Notice how God defines noble and good.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.980]   People who hear and retain are noble and good.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.980]   This is what happens when seed meets good soil.
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:22.540]   These people don't have hard hearts.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.820]   They have hearts that are noble and good.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.580]   These are the kind of hearts that don't fall away or don't get choked out by worries and
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:35.420]   pleasure because they persevere.
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.260]   This is the kind of heart, when the seed meets the soil, the seed is able to fulfill its
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:47.280]   potential to do what it's meant to do and to produce a crop, to bear fruit.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.900]   This is the point of discipleship.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.980]   This is the aim of following Jesus with your life.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:56.060]   True discipleship, a true sign of whether or not you really have a heart that follows
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:01.660]   Jesus is to see whether or not you have fruit to show for it.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:07.880]   But the key word here is this, perseverance is the key.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.780]   Because crop, fruit doesn't just pop up overnight.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:16.460]   Those chia pets, as gimmicky as they are, takes time to grow.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:23.060]   The only way this crop grows, the only way the fruit comes is through time, is through
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.620]   persevering.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:29.820]   In other words, it's not that the enemy hasn't maybe tried to snatch the seed away.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.740]   It's not that the good seed and the good soil is free from testing and temptations.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.140]   It's not that the seed is free from worries of riches and pleasures and everything that
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.520]   comes with life.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.980]   This soil probably had to deal with all these things as well.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:47.940]   But the key difference is that they persevere, they don't give up.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:54.580]   It requires a lifetime of response to consider what one's soul looks like to a slowly developing
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.460]   crop.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:03.380]   Fruit does not appear overnight, neither does the harvest of our heart.
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:09.920]   Which is why the Bible tells us time and time again, be strong and courageous, endure.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.260]   It is the one who endures to the end who will be saved.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.860]   We will reap what we sow when we don't give up.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:23.180]   Run with endurance the race that is set before you, church.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:29.460]   A fruitful life looks like a life alive with faith.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.580]   That's when we see the crop.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:39.060]   That's when we see the fruit of a heart that has God's Word taken root in it.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.820]   So again, what does this look like?
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.340]   Luke actually gives us some examples.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.740]   Just as he gave examples of people that didn't listen to the Word of God and didn't take
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.320]   in their hearts, there are good examples of this too.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:55.140]   So a fruitful life looks like the woman who were with Jesus at the beginning of our story.
[00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:01.260]   When I began reading this message, I began in Luke 8, verse 1 intentionally because it
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:07.060]   describes a group of women whom Jesus had healed, cast out demons, healed from diseases.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.260]   But look what their response is.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.620]   Luke tells us that Jesus helped these women.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:15.820]   He had healed them, but now their response was, "These women were helping to support
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:20.140]   Jesus' ministry out of their own means."
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.980]   They didn't let their resources, they didn't let the pleasures and the comfort that came
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.220]   with what they had stop their faith in Jesus.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:32.100]   Rather, they used it to serve Him and His ministry.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:36.460]   Luke shares the story of the Roman centurion who had so much faith, he told Jesus, "You
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.540]   don't need to come to my house.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.780]   I'm not worthy of you coming to my house for you to heal my servant, but just say the
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:45.540]   word and my servant will be healed."
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.980]   That's what fruit looks like.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:54.180]   The faith on display is the sinful woman who broke open, perfumed the most precious thing
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:37:00.820]   she had in order to honor and anoint Jesus' feet.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:06.180]   A faith on display is John the Baptist living a life in the desert, eating locusts and honey.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:11.180]   People thought he was crazy, people thought he was mad, but he dedicated his life to proclaiming
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.620]   the word of God, to prepare the way of the coming of the Messiah.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:23.420]   That was what his life mission was about and nothing could stop him from doing that.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.340]   And so here's the surprising end of this passage.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:31.620]   Actually, it's not a coincidence that Jesus' teaching about a lamp on the stand actually
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.500]   comes at the end of this parable.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.820]   Because the lamp on the stand is actually another mini-parable, Jesus trying to explain
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.260]   what He has just said.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.020]   A lamp is meant to what?
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.940]   Shed light and not be hidden.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:51.740]   A seed is meant to bear fruit and not to be snatched up or growthless.
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:58.540]   A follower of Jesus is meant to live a life of faith, rooted in the word of God and then
[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.180]   inspires others to do the same.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:06.140]   Church, if you have ears today, then we need to hear.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.180]   What kind of soil do we want to be?
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:14.780]   You know, as I was thinking about this, it brought me all the way back to Genesis.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.260]   It sounds like Andrew, I know, but it brought me back to Genesis.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.780]   Because when God created human beings, how did He create us?
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.220]   He created us from the soil.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:35.220]   God formed us out of the soil and breathed His life into us.
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.540]   God created you to be that soil.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:46.180]   To be that soil where once His word is planted in you, we take root and bear fruit.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.480]   To make a difference in this world.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.320]   To make a difference in your life.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.220]   Because we have a world out there that is starving and hungry and they need to know
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.220]   who they are and who God sees them and how much God loves them.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.940]   And without seed that bears fruit, this whole world is going to be hungry and die without
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.100]   Him.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.140]   And that's not the world we want to see.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.740]   That's not the society we want to build.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.300]   That's not what God's kingdom looks like.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:19.140]   God's kingdom is about bearing fruit and fruit that bears even more fruit.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.300]   A thousandfold, a hundredfold.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:26.620]   Church, what kind of soil do we want to be?
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:34.780]   May we be the kind of soil that God's word can take root and grow and bear fruit for
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:41.020]   ourselves, for our lives, for this city and for the world that so desperately needs Him.
