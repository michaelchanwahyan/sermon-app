1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 Good afternoon, yeah, it's afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,000
 This is Jennifer. In case you don't know me, I come here every once in a while only,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,800
 but it's so lovely to be here.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,880
 But I am the CG pastor, community groups pastor at Wan Chai.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,840
 So basically my work is to build community.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,520
 So when I hear from Tim that I'm gonna be preaching on this topic,

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,720
 "Just Community," I'm like, "Oh, this is so interesting."

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,400
 But Tim insisted that this is just a coincidence. He didn't plan for this.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,760
 But no matter whether it is planned or not,

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,440
 it's so lovely just for me to be here to share what I am really passionate in.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
 So I really look forward to unpack the passage with you.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,680
 So let me pick up a little bit from what we did last week.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,240
 So last week we saw that in Acts chapter 2,

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,880
 the apostles went out to evangelize,

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,360
 share the gospel, and then God gave 3,000 people

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,880
 to come to faith, to get baptized.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,680
 And this is amazing as well.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,160
 That's the result of, like, Christians following the Holy Spirit and do his work.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,800
 So, but let's imagine this together.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,760
 Let's say we go outside today, we evangelize,

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,160
 and God gives us 3,000 people.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,560
 What would come to your mind?

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,160
 First of all, we praise the Lord for all these salvations happening.

24
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,640
 But immediately we would start thinking about,

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
 "How do we fit 3,000 people in this room?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,040
 How many services do we need?

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,680
 How do we get to know all the people that have joined our community?"

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,360
 I think immediately a lot of questions, a lot of planning

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,440
 will come to our mind as well, right?

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,560
 So, because we don't know what to do,

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,080
 we've never had that many people in our church community.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,760
 Then we were like, "What do we do now?"

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,680
 So this is the same to the apostles as well.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 Like, this is something new for them.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,120
 They've not been there before.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,800
 They've never had 3,000 people in the church.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,200
 So it was the uncharted season for the apostles as well.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,400
 They were just responding to the Holy Spirit,

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,560
 and God adds 3,000 people to them.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,120
 This was not planned.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,280
 They did not go out with a strategy or marketing plan,

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,880
 aimed to have 3,000 people in the church.

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,560
 But this is what happened.

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,920
 This is the result.

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,240
 So now they have to learn how to do life together with these people.

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,000
 So this is our focus today.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 What does it look like to be a community who follow Jesus together?

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,720
 Throughout my years working with community groups,

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,680
 I've heard one question a lot.

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,600
 "Can I just follow Jesus and mind my own business,

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,160
 but not in a community?"

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,560
 I think this is like the most heard questions ever.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,160
 So I know that it might not be super comfortable

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,360
 for us to really be super close to other Christians,

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,840
 but there's nothing wrong with that fear or whatever behind the question.

56
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,160
 But today we want to look into the Bible together,

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 what it really means to be a group of people that follow Christ together.

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,960
 We will continue to read on Acts 2, verse 42-47.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,720
 But before we read that, let's approach the scripture this way.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,080
 This is not a model for us to follow that we do A, B, C, and D,

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
 then we are a perfect church.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,560
 This is something the early church was learning as well.

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,880
 They were in the process of learning.

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,720
 So hopefully as we open the passage together,

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,600
 this will give you inspiration that will allow you to reflect on

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,480
 what it means to be in a community together.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,240
 So let's read the scripture together.

68
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,000
 "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings and to fellowship,

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,560
 to the breaking of bread and to prayer.

70
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,680
 Everyone was filled with awe at many wonders and signs

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,160
 performed by the apostles.

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,720
 All the believers were together and had everything in common.

73
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,440
 They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,000
 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,320
 They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,

76
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,560
 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.

77
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,320
 And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved."

78
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,440
 So there is a lot being said in this passage.

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,000
 So first of all, I want to highlight one word to you, which is "devoted."

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,600
 This word always stands out to me when I read this passage.

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,440
 And what does it mean to be devoted?

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,560
 In Greek, the word has the meanings of being persistent,

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:34,800
 obstinately in, being faithful to, and remaining in something.

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,440
 I don't know how this speaks to you, but if we think about it,

85
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,960
 being persistent can actually be a very countercultural thing to do.

86
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,040
 Today, people might not be super valuing being persistent.

87
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,920
 It's something, like imagine this, it's something that's not work in our workplace.

88
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
 What will come to our mind?

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,440
 We will think about, "Should I change my job?

90
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,480
 Should I start over in another company?"

91
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,520
 And if we have conflicts with our friends, perhaps it's easier for us to withdraw

92
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,680
 and to just make some new friends and move forward.

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
 Same to church community.

94
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,600
 Today, if I don't like this church,

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,280
 maybe I can just easily find another church down the road.

96
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,000
 I'm not saying everyone is like this today.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
 I'm still seeing a lot of faithful people around us.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,800
 But sometimes it seems that it's just easier to give up

99
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,760
 in terms of relationships, in terms of being persistent, right?

100
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,080
 This is the honest truth, that it is very convenient and tempting

101
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
 if something does not work,

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,240
 we can just start it over by changing the environment.

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,320
 And me, personally, had experience in that before.

104
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,240
 So I remember when I first came to faith, I was a teenager,

105
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,320
 and I joined a community of my age.

106
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,840
 So, but one year in, I felt like I'm an outsider,

107
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,920
 because most of the people grew up in that church.

108
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,080
 They knew each other since they were a kid.

109
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,520
 And as a new believer, as a new person in this church,

110
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,760
 I felt very hard to blend in.

111
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,600
 So at some point, I just want to leave the church.

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,120
 But I respect my pastor, so I talked to him.

113
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,920
 I said, I told my youth pastor that I really want to leave this church

114
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,840
 and go to somewhere else.

115
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,760
 So when he heard that, the first thing he said was,

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,440
 "All relationships take time, and it takes effort."

117
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
 And he knows my personality.

118
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,320
 I'm a person who likes challenges.

119
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,600
 I'm a person who will keep my promise.

120
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,520
 So he challenged me to commit for three years.

121
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,240
 It's not just showing up when I feel like it,

122
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,080
 but really commit to engage in the community,

123
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,560
 to make it my priority, to try to as involve as possible.

124
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,440
 If three years, I still feel like I want to leave,

125
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,880
 then I can make a decision on that.

126
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,600
 I was like, "What are you talking about?

127
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,320
 I want to leave already. You asked me for three more years?

128
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,480
 Are you serious?"

129
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,600
 But, yeah, because of the trust I have for that pastor,

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,480
 I think I would just give it a try.

131
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,240
 So that three years, after that day,

132
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
 that three years, I've been as engaged as possible.

133
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,520
 Even I don't feel like it, I still show up.

134
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,160
 I participate.

135
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,920
 I get to know my brothers and sisters.

136
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,360
 And later, I try to serve as well,

137
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,720
 start serving and contributing to the community as much as I can.

138
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
 And guess what?

139
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,640
 Three years later, I didn't only find myself already blended in already,

140
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,200
 but also I became a very core member of that church

141
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,560
 and my community as well.

142
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,200
 And of course, there were bad days that we had a lot of conflicts,

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,040
 teenagers or young adults, we just conflict every other week.

144
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,360
 But because of the promise that I had for my pastor

145
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,560
 and also to Jesus already,

146
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,960
 that I chose to be persistent.

147
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,040
 I chose to continue.

148
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,720
 And now, looking back, I'm really grateful for that pastor

149
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,760
 to really challenge me to commit for a long time.

150
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,240
 Because if I just gave up, I would never learn the lesson.

151
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,160
 What a valuable lesson for me to learn to be devoted,

152
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,320
 to be committed to my brothers and sisters.

153
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,640
 So I'm not sure whether you struggle with that as well.

154
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,120
 If you're me, you might be struggling in persisting in your community

155
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,880
 or in your relationship as well.

156
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,240
 And if you are struggling with your community,

157
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,560
 if you want to give up, my encouragement for you today

158
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,120
 is that it really takes time to build relationship,

159
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,840
 to overcome the differences that we have.

160
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,040
 Because after all, we are different people.

161
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,080
 We are all unique.

162
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,880
 And even during the bad days,

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,760
 I pray that God will show you how to grow in that,

164
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,400
 how to really persist and be committed to God,

165
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,160
 and he will give you the grace to overcome.

166
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,960
 And then we will look into what the early Christians have devoted.

167
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,280
 It is also very important to be intentional

168
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,680
 to what we are committing in our community.

169
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,640
 Church is not just a group of Christians gathering together,

170
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,400
 and then automatically, boom, we are growing

171
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,360
 and we are participating in God's work.

172
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,240
 We need to be mindful, be intentional about what we are devoting to.

173
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,040
 So I know we've been there as well.

174
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,600
 Even a group of Christians gathering together,

175
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,520
 we can always just talk about where did we travel,

176
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,480
 our last week in Japan, and things like that.

177
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,040
 So being intentional is really important.

178
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,240
 So let's continue to look into the scripture.

179
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,720
 So I will highlight the first 42 for us.

180
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,320
 It says they are devoted to four things.

181
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,520
 The first one is the apostles' teachings.

182
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,240
 The second one is fellowship.

183
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
 The third one is the breaking of bread.

184
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,480
 And finally, the prayer.

185
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,280
 So let me recap the context a little bit.

186
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,800
 So these are the people who heard about the gospel,

187
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,720
 they decided to follow Jesus, they got baptized,

188
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,920
 and now they are new to this identity as Christians.

189
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,120
 And together, they are also figuring out

190
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,600
 how to live the life together as Christians.

191
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,800
 So those four things in first 42 are essential

192
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 to shape their identity as the followers of Christ.

193
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,800
 This is how they learned to be Christians

194
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
 after they got baptized.

195
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,160
 They are all important elements of Christians' lives,

196
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,480
 and I'm going to break them down one by one.

197
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,360
 So the first one is the apostles' teaching.

198
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,560
 Those apostles are the ones who witnessed Jesus in person,

199
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
 and commissioned by Jesus to teach everyone

200
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,920
 to obey everything Jesus has commanded in Matthew 28.

201
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,800
 So to the early Christians, it is not only about showing up

202
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,000
 when the apostles are preaching,

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,480
 but it is also about obeying Jesus,

204
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,080
 and also to put those things into practice.

205
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,520
 Of course, today, all the apostles are with Jesus now,

206
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,880
 but we got the Bible,

207
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,160
 which has written what Jesus did and taught.

208
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,000
 So how are we doing that in following apostles' teaching?

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,520
 Are we devoted to read the Bible,

210
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,840
 and also to submit to what the Bible says?

211
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,120
 Are we allowing the Bible shape our lives,

212
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,680
 our character, and our action?

213
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,720
 And the second element is fellowship.

214
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,240
 It might be a very Christianese word, if you will.

215
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,760
 So this works in Greek in the original language.

216
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,120
 It can be translated into a simple word,

217
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,560
 into English, it's close relationship.

218
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,560
 So not sure how this word speaks to you as well.

219
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,080
 Again, to me, it is a very counter-cultural thing

220
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,560
 to do as well, especially in Hong Kong.

221
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,640
 This city, the people are very individualistic.

222
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,800
 We are busy, we mind our own business.

223
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,280
 Most people would not spend time talking to our neighbors

224
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,640
 outside of our friends and family circles.

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,120
 And sometimes we see this in church as well.

226
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,600
 Rushing off to our next appointment

227
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,560
 after going to church service.

228
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,760
 We might not have much time to talk to one another in church.

229
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,240
 But as brothers and sisters,

230
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,920
 we are not supposed to be just sitting to each other

231
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,120
 in the service, and that's it.

232
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,600
 Jesus commands us to love one another.

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,720
 In our community, our brothers and sisters

234
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,960
 is the place that we can put his command into practice.

235
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,600
 So if you are one of those who don't have a community yet,

236
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,760
 I'm not sure what's the reason behind

237
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,960
 what makes you hesitating a little bit.

238
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,480
 It could be negative experience in the past,

239
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,240
 but that makes sense.

240
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,360
 And perhaps you are still new

241
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,960
 and observing the church itself.

242
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,840
 But in this season of Uncharted,

243
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
 let me challenge you to maybe think about

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,760
 taking one step forward.

245
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,920
 To really invest in a close relationship

246
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,880
 to the people around you.

247
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,640
 To take one step forward,

248
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,920
 and I pray that God will lead you

249
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,840
 to experience a closer relationship

250
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,840
 with your brothers and sisters like never before.

251
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,320
 And let's continue to look at the third thing,

252
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,200
 which is the breaking of bread.

253
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,800
 Here it could mean communion,

254
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,440
 which we just did just now.

255
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,960
 It's amazing that we could take communion

256
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,640
 like that together.

257
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,320
 But it can also mean sharing a meal together.

258
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,720
 So through committing to take communion,

259
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,640
 we are committed to remember what Jesus has done for us.

260
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,920
 And with sharing the meals together,

261
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
 if we look at 1st 46,

262
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,840
 they broke the bread and ate together in their homes,

263
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,200
 which is not only about eating together,

264
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,960
 but also like hospitality as well.

265
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,680
 In gospel, we see a lot of stories

266
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,000
 that Jesus go to different houses

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,400
 and share a meal with those who are marginalized

268
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,160
 in their society to show acceptance to these people.

269
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,600
 And this is for us as well.

270
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,640
 I'm a huge advocate for the communities to eat together

271
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,800
 to really show that I am interested in your life.

272
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,080
 We, like actually we engage people differently

273
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,720
 when we eat together.

274
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,600
 We know the allergies,

275
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,360
 we know what they like, what they don't like.

276
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,880
 We accommodate each other's needs

277
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,680
 and to show it is okay

278
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,640
 that you don't like eating vegetables.

279
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,600
 I still love you.

280
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,720
 I still accept you.

281
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,960
 It's funny, right?

282
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,320
 I think you have a monthly bring your own lunch thing, right?

283
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
 No, not anymore.

284
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,320
 But anyway, let me encourage you to really find a time

285
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,960
 to sit together, to eat together,

286
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,280
 to get take away and just use the space

287
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
 to share a meal together.

288
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,280
 It's just really a precious experience for us as Christians.

289
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,400
 And the final one is prayer.

290
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,600
 It is quite straightforward to us.

291
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,960
 I think like through our devotion in prayer,

292
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,960
 we seek God and we live up one another in our community.

293
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,320
 And again, I know that we all pray individually,

294
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,680
 but not sure whether you are committed

295
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,440
 to corporate prayer as well.

296
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,960
 As we just announced, here we have a monthly prayer evening

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,360
 that if you have never joined that before,

298
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,320
 I will encourage you to do so

299
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,200
 because there's power when Christians gather together

300
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,440
 and pray corporately and seek God together.

301
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,560
 So I'm not sure like in this room,

302
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,520
 how long you've been a Christian.

303
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,640
 It might sound a little bit basic

304
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,240
 if you have been a Christian for a long time,

305
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,920
 or if you are new to faith,

306
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,840
 you might be a little bit overwhelmed,

307
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,920
 like, "Oh, there's so many things I need to do."

308
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,320
 But we don't need to work on all things at the same time.

309
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
 No matter in what season you are in,

310
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,600
 there's always some things Jesus want to cause you to learn.

311
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,960
 Perhaps today we can pray together

312
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,160
 and see which elements of the Christian's life

313
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,480
 stands out to you in this season.

314
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,000
 And we can work on that in the coming season.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,840
 So I also want to share that as a pastor,

316
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,160
 there is something I need to work on as well.

317
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,760
 And sometimes I need to learn in a hard way.

318
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,000
 So there are things I still are growing

319
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
 and learning as well.

320
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,440
 And let me share another story with you.

321
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,920
 So as a Hong Kong kid growing up,

322
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,680
 I am raised to be independent,

323
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,960
 and I am more a private person.

324
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,840
 I think Chapman can verify that I do not use social media.

325
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,840
 So I am quite private in some sense.

326
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,800
 And I'm not someone that I have a lot to share

327
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
 about myself all the time,

328
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,520
 except like here is a challenge for me as well,

329
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,640
 that I have to share a lot about myself,

330
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,440
 and how Jesus spoke to me through scripture,

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
 through the different things that he has me to experience.

332
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,000
 So my personality or how I am raised by my parents

333
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
 might not be super helpful for me

334
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,480
 to grow up in a Christian community.

335
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,480
 So one time, I think Emma from One Child Worship pastor,

336
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,680
 she's also my friend.

337
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,800
 So one time we were just casually talking about something.

338
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,200
 She asked me something about me.

339
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,680
 And I told her, "It's my privacy.

340
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,040
 I'm not telling you."

341
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,080
 And she was not offended,

342
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,080
 but she suddenly become very serious and say this to me,

343
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,000
 "Jennifer, why are you refusing others to love you?"

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,400
 At the moment, it spoke to me somehow,

345
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,840
 but I just try to get away from that.

346
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,480
 I talk about something else and I got away from that.

347
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
 And then months later,

348
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
 I think we were having a pastoral retreat.

349
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,760
 We went outside and then I suddenly felt very sick.

350
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,600
 I don't know why.

351
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
 I felt very dizzy the whole day

352
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,200
 and I couldn't even stand or sit for a long time.

353
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,280
 I have to lie down to make myself not feeling dizzy.

354
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,120
 It was terrible.

355
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,080
 I've never been there before.

356
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,520
 And of course, all my colleagues were very nervous.

357
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,880
 Like, "What happened, Jennifer?

358
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,720
 What happened?

359
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,760
 Do we need to call the ambulance?

360
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,840
 Do we need to send you to the hospital?"

361
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,560
 And I'm like, "Of course I would decline."

362
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,960
 I'm like, "Ah, I'm okay.

363
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,880
 Just let me rest and then I will taxi home later."

364
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,680
 And then, so Emma showed up again.

365
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,920
 Of course, she will be there.

366
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,640
 And then she came to me and she had me to promise her,

367
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,680
 "No matter I feel better the next day or not,

368
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,120
 I need to promise her that I will go see a doctor

369
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,760
 and I will let her know how it goes."

370
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,320
 And then I'm like, "It's not a big deal."

371
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,160
 And my medical situation is my personal data

372
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,000
 and things like that.

373
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,880
 I've seen ridiculous things to her.

374
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,080
 But she insists, so I promised her,

375
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,480
 like, "Okay, I will let you know tomorrow.

376
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,880
 I will go see a doctor and I will let you know."

377
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,760
 And then, so I taxi home and then I took a,

378
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,600
 I slept very early on that day.

379
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,120
 Hopefully that I will feel better the next day.

380
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,520
 So I think I slept at 8 p.m. or something like that.

381
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,800
 And then in the midnight, I woke up.

382
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,680
 And for no reason, I was tearing in the middle of night.

383
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,400
 And immediately I had a sense

384
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,280
 that God has something to say to me.

385
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,720
 So I prayed, "Lord, are you telling me something?

386
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,880
 Tell me, I'm listening."

387
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,200
 And then, so that question Emma asked me

388
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,640
 a few months ago showed up again.

389
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,840
 "Why do you refuse others to love you?"

390
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,080
 So God was saying to me that,

391
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,640
 "It doesn't matter how I grew up.

392
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,640
 It doesn't matter how I experience love in my family.

393
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,640
 What I can do right now is to choose

394
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,120
 to allow the people around me to love me

395
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,080
 and to allow them to participate in my life.

396
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,840
 And it's okay to allow people

397
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,600
 to meet my physical needs as well."

398
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,680
 So I was really, I'm like, "Oh, sorry God, I messed up."

399
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,840
 And I didn't know that it was that serious.

400
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,120
 So I cried, I prayed, I asked God to forgive me

401
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,320
 for doing that.

402
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,840
 And the next week that I confessed to Emma as well,

403
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,800
 that I've done that to you.

404
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 And it was the lesson for me that God wanted me

405
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,120
 to learn to have a close relationship with my friends,

406
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,120
 to let them come closer beyond my comfort level.

407
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,600
 And it's been a few years that that incident has happened.

408
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,280
 And I'm really thankful that God really showed me it's okay.

409
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,720
 And I felt like even it was uncomfortable,

410
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,160
 but I grew a lot.

411
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,000
 And I experienced a close relationship like never before.

412
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,680
 So I'm not sure what stands out to you

413
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,640
 with the things that we covered just now in my story.

414
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,080
 But I just want to pray that God will show you

415
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,160
 how he wants you to grow in community.

416
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,080
 And he will bring you to the right people

417
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,800
 to grow alongside with you as well.

418
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,120
 And there's one more thing the early church community

419
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,040
 has devoted in, and I would like to share on that as well.

420
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,600
 And so let's continue to read the scripture

421
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,760
 in chapter two, verse 44 to 45.

422
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,840
 All the believers were together and had everything in common.

423
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,640
 They sold property and possessions

424
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,320
 to give to anyone who had need.

425
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,440
 This might look a little bit scary to us, right?

426
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,400
 Are you saying we need to sell all our houses

427
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,960
 or like make our savings available to everyone?

428
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,400
 But let's read chapter four together with this passage.

429
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,160
 Perhaps it can give us a little bit more idea

430
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,120
 on how we did that in the church community.

431
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,960
 Let's read chapter four, verse 32 to 37 as well.

432
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,200
 All the believers were one in heart and mind.

433
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,880
 No one claimed that any of their possessions were their own,

434
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,400
 but they shared everything they had.

435
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,760
 With great power, the apostles continued to testify

436
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,640
 to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.

437
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,760
 And God's grace was so powerfully at work in them all

438
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
 that there was no needy person among them.

439
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
 For from time to time,

440
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,240
 those who owned land or houses sold them,

441
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,960
 brought the money from the sales

442
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,560
 and put it at the apostles' feet.

443
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,440
 And it was distributed to anyone who had need.

444
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,840
 Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus,

445
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,280
 whom the apostles called Barnabas,

446
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,320
 sold the field he owned and brought the money

447
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,440
 and put it at the apostles' feet.

448
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,920
 So in chapter four,

449
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,840
 we saw that all the believers were one in heart and mind.

450
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
 The community is demonstrating

451
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,640
 a very great sense of unity here.

452
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,200
 Their generosity comes from a space

453
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,160
 of spiritual unity in Christ,

454
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,880
 instead of a rule enforced in a church

455
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,840
 that once you turn into a Christian,

456
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,120
 you must sell everything

457
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,560
 and you need to make your money available to the church.

458
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,400
 It was not like that.

459
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,920
 Verse 34 says, "From time to time,

460
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,360
 "the people sell their property

461
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 "and take the money to the apostles."

462
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,120
 It should be a continuous process

463
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,320
 for the Christians to do that.

464
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,160
 So it is more like when people see the need

465
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,400
 in the church community,

466
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,320
 they are convicted and they respond

467
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,160
 with selling their property

468
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,640
 and make the money available for others

469
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,760
 in order to meet the physical needs.

470
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,800
 So when somebody needs, someone respond.

471
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,320
 This is their way of following God.

472
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,560
 They do this because they are passionate

473
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,240
 about God's mission for them,

474
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,480
 which is to spread the gospel,

475
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,880
 to love one another,

476
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,160
 and to meet one another's needs.

477
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,120
 In fact, this is not something new.

478
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
 If we look at verse 34,

479
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,840
 it says, "There was no needy person among them."

480
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,920
 The way it expressed in the original language Greek

481
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,720
 is very similar to the Greek translation

482
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,200
 of Deuteronomy 15, verse four.

483
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,120
 So let's look into Deuteronomy as well.

484
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,920
 "However, there need to be no poor people among you.

485
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,080
 "For in the land, the Lord your God

486
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,360
 "is giving you to possess as your inheritance.

487
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,120
 "He will richly bless you

488
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,760
 "if only you fully obey the Lord your God

489
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,520
 "and are careful to follow all these commands

490
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,680
 "I'm giving you today."

491
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,640
 So if we look at the Old Testament,

492
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,800
 there is a lot of laws and commands

493
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,400
 about Israel is to take care of the poor,

494
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,560
 which means it is always on God's heart

495
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,040
 for his people to take care of one another,

496
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,680
 to meet one another's needs.

497
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,720
 If everyone is following God's commands,

498
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,760
 there will be no poor among us.

499
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,480
 This is the picture of justice.

500
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,120
 If everyone is in the right relationship with God

501
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
 and with one another,

502
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,800
 then everything will be in the right place.

503
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,680
 Of course, we cannot be perfect.

504
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,320
 We can never be perfect,

505
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,360
 but we can work towards to live more justly.

506
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,480
 And it starts with the right relationship with God.

507
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,200
 For Israel, it was God who led them out of Egypt,

508
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,760
 entering into the promised land,

509
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,560
 and give them rain so that they have food each year,

510
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,000
 which means all they have was from God.

511
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,240
 So God's command for his people

512
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,240
 to take care of the poor is not only about generosity,

513
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,200
 it's a nice virtue for him to teach his people,

514
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,520
 but it is also a way for the people to recognize

515
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,120
 what they have is from God,

516
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,000
 and they remember God's sovereignty

517
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,560
 and his profession over them.

518
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,520
 And as people own more,

519
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,880
 I think we can see that around us as well.

520
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,000
 It is so easy to fall into the temptation

521
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,120
 that what we earn is because we are hardworking,

522
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,760
 because it's our own effort,

523
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,400
 and we forget about it is God who provide for us.

524
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,280
 So God needs his people to see things

525
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,880
 in the right perspective.

526
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,760
 And for us, it is very similar

527
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,040
 to why we tithe and offer in the church,

528
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,560
 because we recognize that all we have is provided from God,

529
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,680
 and this is our relationship with God,

530
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,560
 and we offer to give back to him

531
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,440
 and to participate in his work in this church

532
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
 and in this city.

533
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,160
 And also, apart from tithing and offering,

534
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,440
 sometimes we see the needs around ourselves,

535
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,480
 and we can respond directly,

536
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,280
 because we believe that God can provide

537
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,760
 for my brothers and sisters through my actions as well.

538
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,200
 And through my generous acts in our community,

539
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,800
 he provide for our people.

540
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,200
 So this is really the heart behind all things in common

541
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,480
 that comes from recognizing God's proficient

542
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,400
 and the unity within the community,

543
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,960
 to have one heart and one mind,

544
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,320
 which is loving God and loving one another.

545
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,360
 It is more a way of living

546
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,920
 than a practice that we need to adopt,

547
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,800
 so there are more than one way for us to do it.

548
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,240
 So in the early church,

549
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,400
 they did that by selling the procession

550
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,800
 and make the money available.

551
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,160
 And for us today, we can pray and ask

552
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,160
 how we can respond to this call from God as well,

553
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,440
 how we live justly as a community together,

554
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,040
 how we follow God in our finance as well.

555
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,240
 So I was debating how I close this message.

556
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,520
 I written down one of my stories,

557
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,640
 but I feel like today I want to share something

558
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,640
 that I witnessed before the Yuen Long Church was moved here.

559
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,800
 So a few years ago, three, four years ago,

560
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,400
 we at our Fission Sunday, Pastor Andrew shared

561
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,360
 a vision of planting the Yuen Long Church.

562
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,520
 So we asked for offering,

563
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,920
 we set up the fund for the Yuen Long Church plant.

564
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,680
 And so of course, like the first month,

565
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,160
 a lot of people would give, right?

566
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,400
 And then later people were like,

567
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,200
 might forget about it and things like that.

568
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,040
 And, but because of my duty,

569
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,680
 I'm always around on Sundays or like on other days.

570
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,840
 So one time I was next to concierge

571
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,800
 and then the staff, they asked me to go there

572
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,480
 because she couldn't really understand

573
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,080
 what a gentleman needed.

574
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,200
 So I approached and asked how I can help you.

575
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 And so he shared with me that his income is not stable,

576
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,680
 it's not a monthly pay that he will get.

577
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,000
 He get paid whenever he finish some project,

578
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,320
 it could be biweekly, it could be each week,

579
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,680
 or it could be monthly.

580
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,440
 But he wanted, he doesn't have a credit card,

581
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,360
 he has no digital payment.

582
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,360
 And, but he said he is convicted to give

583
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,920
 to the Yuen Long Church plant.

584
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,320
 So whenever he get paid, he will take our part of it

585
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,920
 and he will come to church and ask concierge to help him

586
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,040
 to offer to the church plant project.

587
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,320
 So I helped him at the moment

588
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,320
 and then I just really saw him like irregularly

589
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,080
 that he will come to concierge and give.

590
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,560
 And this is the unity that this brother in Christ

591
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,120
 is demonstrating.

592
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,720
 He heard the vision, he heard the mission from God

593
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,640
 that we are to start a church in Yuen Long.

594
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,920
 And he responded because he owned,

595
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,160
 from the bottom of his heart, he owned that vision

596
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,160
 no matter whether he will be end up

597
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,400
 joining the Yuen Long Church or not.

598
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,840
 At that time, I think the,

599
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,720
 you guys were not meeting in the kindergarten

600
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,160
 and so there was nothing to be seen by the congregation.

601
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:14,160
 But without seeing it, because of his devotion to God

602
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,720
 and to his brothers and sisters,

603
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,640
 he choose to make what he has not just to himself.

604
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,800
 He choose to share part of it in this vision

605
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,640
 that God has given us as a church.

606
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,400
 So I hope, it's really encouraging for me

607
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,640
 to see so many people today.

608
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,040
 This morning, Cantonese people had so many people

609
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,680
 that was surprising.

610
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,560
 It was not like that last year when I came.

611
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,960
 So I feel like I really want to share this story with you

612
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,920
 that this is what unity means.

613
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,640
 This is what all things in common mean,

614
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,360
 that it is really our devotion to God

615
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,240
 and to the work that he is doing

616
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,520
 and to the people around us.

617
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,040
 So we've covered a lot of different aspects

618
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,000
 in community today, but I wonder what stands out to you.

619
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,680
 As I said before, we don't need to be

620
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,960
 do all things together.

621
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,720
 It will overwhelm us.

622
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,840
 But in this uncharted season, it's really for us

623
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,840
 to step out of our comfort zone and to really seek God.

624
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,880
 What, God, what are you wanting me to do

625
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,480
 in the coming season?

626
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,480
 What are you wanting me to be devoted to

627
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,880
 and to be persistent in in the coming season?

628
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,440
 Perhaps there are areas that you have not

629
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,960
 invited people to step in before.

630
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,440
 Perhaps you're still hesitating about the idea of community.

631
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,240
 Perhaps you're still holding fears

632
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,040
 because of the experience that you had before.

633
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,640
 But let's be encouraged that in this season,

634
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,200
 it is really about following the lead of the Holy Spirit

635
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,600
 and to allow him to bring us to an area

636
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,280
 that we have never experienced before, but God is there.

637
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,440
 So can I invite you to stand?

638
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,640
 I would like to pray for us.

639
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,800
 (footsteps)

640
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:26,280
 Not sure what resonate with you,

641
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,840
 but I'll encourage you to be open before God and ask him

642
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,600
 to show you how he wants you to take one step forward

643
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,600
 in terms of community.

644
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:55,360
 If you are struggling with community, with relationships,

645
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,400
 you really want to give up, tell Jesus

646
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,400
 about what you are struggling and ask him for the grace.

647
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,400
 And wisdom to respond.

648
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:18,400
 If you're struggling to really see

649
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,400
 how you can inform in community,

650
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,400
 how you can grow in community,

651
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:34,400
 just pray that God will highlight the area

652
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,400
 that you can grow in the coming season.

653
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,400
 If you struggle with being generous,

654
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,400
 just pray to God that he will show us first

655
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,400
 the needs around us and how we ought to respond.

656
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,400
 And we pray that faith will rise

657
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,400
 because we trust that God provides for us.

658
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,800
 (soft music)

659
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,400
 Jesus, we thank you.

660
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,400
 We thank you that you are always working in your church,

661
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,400
 in your community.

662
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,400
 We thank you that you do not intend

663
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
 that we follow you by ourselves,

664
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,400
 but we have people around us to grow together,

665
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,400
 to allow us to love other people and to be loved as well.

666
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,400
 Jesus, we thank you for all the people in this room

667
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
 who are our brothers and sisters.

668
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,400
 And Lord, we live up what's going on in our heart right now,

669
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 what we are struggling in terms of community life.

670
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,400
 Lord, we first, if any of us are struggling

671
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,400
 with hurt, disappointment in community,

672
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
 Lord, we ask for your healing.

673
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,400
 We surrender our fear in front of you.

674
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,400
 And God give us the courage to break through

675
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,400
 and to follow you in this season.

676
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
 Help us to trust you more

677
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,400
 and help us to be open to the journey

678
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
 that you are about to take us.

679
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:46,400
 And Lord, show us how we can grow to be more like you.

680
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,400
 Show us where your heart is

681
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,400
 for us to be more involved,

682
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
 to be more devoted in our community.

683
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,400
 We pray that you will also allow to bring us

684
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,400
 to the right people so we can grow together.

685
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
 We can keep one another accountable.

686
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
 We can celebrate our growth together.

687
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,400
 And Lord, give us the grace along the way.

688
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,400
 And we pray for our generosity as well.

689
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,400
 That God, you are so generous.

690
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,400
 So generous to us.

691
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,400
 Teach us to be generous as well.

692
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,400
 Teach us to have the right relationship with you.

693
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,400
 Teach us to see the needs around us

694
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,400
 and convict us to respond.

695
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
 We want to be part of your work.

696
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
 We want to be your hands and feet

697
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,400
 to give, to love, to care.

698
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
 And Lord, we pray that our faith will rise

699
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
 as we are giving more.

700
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,400
 We trust that you are our ultimate provision.

701
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,400
 Lord, we ask for your help

702
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,400
 in all the areas that we've just hurt.

703
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,400
 We trust that only by your power we can do that.

704
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
 We can follow you.

705
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
 So Lord, we ask that your Holy Spirit

706
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,400
 will continue to lead us and guide us

707
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
 and lead us into a journey

708
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,400
 definitely we've never experienced before.

709
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
 And we thank you in Jesus' name.

710
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
 Amen.
