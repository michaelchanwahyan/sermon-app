1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 Wonderful. Good morning everyone. How are we all? It's good to see you. Welcome to

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,560
 everybody online as well. It's great to have you with us. As we continue our

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,800
 sermon series in the book of Acts today, I want to introduce you this week and

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,540
 next week to two of the most important and influential people in the whole of

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,560
 the New Testament. And I want you, or I want to help you, to understand how their

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,240
 story shapes yours. In fact, these two people are not just the most important

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,700
 and influential in the New Testament, but they are actually two people who have

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,320
 radically reshaped the trajectory of human history. And here's the crazy thing

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,540
 about these two people. You are probably not very familiar with them. And I think

10
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,920
 that's kind of, kind of the beauty of Jesus Christ. That I think so often the

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,680
 very people that Jesus Christ uses to change the world are the very people

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,480
 that the world so quickly forgets. And if you're sitting in here today, and if

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,980
 you're feeling a little bit lonely, a little bit forgotten, if you're feeling

14
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,440
 like perhaps nobody sees your true value, if you're struggling today with feeling

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,920
 just a little bit outside of community, if you're feeling segregated or alone, if

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,080
 you're feeling like you don't have much to contribute at all to what God might

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,160
 be doing in Hong Kong, or might be doing here at the Vine, or in your sphere of

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,880
 influence, then the next two weeks are about you. I want to say this right up

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:44,040
 front, that in this room, the potential that there is for the power of the Holy

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,760
 Spirit to be ministering around our city in this time and in this hour is

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:57,400
 unfathomable. What sits inside of you, waiting to be released, is nothing short

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,440
 of the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. And I want to pray for you

23
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,600
 that as we open up the story of these two relatively unfamiliar people, these

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,520
 two people that history has forgotten and does not talk much about, you will

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,640
 find a fire being lit inside of you to say, "You know what? I can make a

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:27,160
 difference. You know what? Because of what is inside of me, I can change the world."

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,720
 I wonder whether you pray with me. Father, I just want to thank you for every person

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,040
 in this room and online in this moment. I want to thank you, Lord, for the potential

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,480
 that sits in us, not because of our great strength. Lord, I want to thank you that

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
 the potential that sits inside of each one of us is the Spirit of God that has

31
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,480
 chosen us, set us apart, equipped us, and releases us. And Father, I want to pray

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,600
 that as we look at these two individuals over this week and next, Lord, something

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:57,280
 would stir inside of this church, Lord, and you would shift us, move us forward,

34
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,280
 bring us to our knees. Lord, we pray we would be changed. We thank you so much

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,160
 for that by your Spirit alone. In Jesus' name, everyone says. To introduce you to the

36
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,520
 first of these incredible people, I need to take you to perhaps the most famous

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,800
 passage in the whole book of Acts, the moment where the Apostle Paul has his

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,280
 dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus. Now, this story is one in which

39
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,920
 you could do a whole sermon series around. And as I was preparing for this,

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,040
 there's so much I wanted to say in this story, but I'm actually cutting out a lot

41
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,200
 of what can be said in this story because I really want to focus in on

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,880
 just the one critical thing that we see here that I think has the most impact on

43
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,560
 you as a Christian in this moment. And then I'm gonna do a teaching with us

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
 today, but I'm also gonna do a bit of a shorter teaching because I want to

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,280
 connect us actually to a practical way, and we're gonna do a practical exercise

46
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,560
 together before you leave today, where you will be actually trying out that

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,680
 very critical thing that Christ has placed in you. You're all looking really

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,040
 scared right now. It's alright. It's gonna be good. Now, I want to jump straight into

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,680
 this. This is Acts 9, starting in verse 1. Are you ready?

50
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:21,480
 "Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,280
 disciples. He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues

52
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,200
 in Damascus, so that if he found anyone there who belonged to the way, whether

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,760
 men or women, he might be able to take them as prisoners to Jerusalem." Let me

54
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,640
 stop there. Saul is the same as Paul, okay? It's the same person. Saul is the

55
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,880
 name that was used, that he used for himself before he came into Christ Jesus.

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,760
 It's the name that was his Hebrew name, Saul. When he came into Christ Jesus,

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,160
 because his gifting was to go to the Gentiles, he used his Greek version of

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,960
 the name, which is Paul. But Saul and Paul, same thing. I'm gonna call him Paul for

59
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,440
 the rest of the message. Now, we are introduced to Paul. This is not the first

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,200
 time we're introduced to Paul. We're introduced to Paul just a few chapters

61
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,760
 earlier in Acts, chapters 7 and 8. And we're introduced to Paul as a Pharisee.

62
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,400
 Paul is a passionate, fiery, young Pharisee. And as a Pharisee, he's committed to the

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,120
 law of God. He's committed to making sure that the Jewish people lived in honor of

64
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,680
 the law. The Pharisees believe that one of the reasons why Israel went into

65
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,160
 exile in the Old Testament is because they disregarded the law. So when they

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,400
 came back from exile, Ezra took the scrolls and read out the scrolls to the

67
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,880
 people. And that was the birth point of the Pharisees. They believed from that

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,240
 point onwards that what was most important to make sure that you didn't

69
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
 come under the wrath of God was to understand the law as best you could and

70
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,880
 to teach that law. And so here's Paul, zealous for the law. And he's so zealous

71
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,240
 for the law that anybody that he and his sect of Judaism deemed was outside of

72
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
 the law, deemed were heretics, he was going to do everything he could to

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,200
 persecute those people. And when we meet Paul, we meet him at the trial of Stephen,

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,580
 a believer in Jesus. And Paul is watching this trial, hoping that Stephen is found a

75
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,400
 heretic so that Stephen can be stoned to death. Well, Stephen is declared a heretic.

76
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,320
 And then Saul comes, or Paul, comes and stands and watches Stephen get stoned.

77
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,880
 Not only that, but he was the only Pharisee in the presence of that

78
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,960
 murderous moment. And what the people would do before they pick up a stone and

79
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 throw it to kill Stephen, they had to take off their cloaks and lay them at

80
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,240
 the foot of a Pharisee. And because Paul was the one Pharisee there at that time,

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,240
 they laid their cloaks at Paul's feet as a symbol to say, "We're killing this man

82
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,360
 on your authority, on the authority of the high priest and the authorities of

83
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,840
 the Pharisees. You have declared this man a heretic. We're picking up stones and

84
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,240
 killing him on your authority." And Paul stood there and said, "Grab your rocks."

85
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,880
 See, the Pharisees were super upset that there was a group of people who were

86
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,440
 beginning to believe that a carpenter from Nazareth was actually the Messiah.

87
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,520
 I mean, imagine believing that. What a ridiculous thing to believe. The problem

88
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,080
 was, a lot of people were beginning to believe this. By the time of the stoning

89
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,680
 of Stephen, it was likely that over 5,000 people in Jerusalem believed that Jesus

90
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,480
 was the Messiah. And Saul and his buddies from the Pharisees sect, they knew that

91
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,880
 this was a problem. Because they believed two things about Jesus. Number one, he was

92
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,880
 a false prophet. There's no way that Jesus, the carpenter from Nazareth, who did the

93
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,320
 things that he did, could ever be the Messiah. He's a false prophet. The second

94
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,200
 thing they believed is this, he's dead. He didn't raise from the dead. What are you

95
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,320
 chatting about? What's resurrection all about? Read the Old Testament

96
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,960
 Scriptures. They don't mention resurrection. What are you talking about?

97
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,920
 He is a false prophet and he's dead. And because of this, he goes to the high

98
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,600
 priest and he says, "Give me letters of authority. I'm on my way to Damascus and

99
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,440
 that's an important city in the Greek Roman Empire. If I find anyone there, if

100
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,840
 this virus has spread from Jerusalem to Damascus, give me the authority to arrest

101
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
 these people, bring them back to Jerusalem, let's put them on trial, and

102
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,400
 let's stone some more Christians." Here's the crazy thing. Scholars tell us that

103
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:29,320
 Paul was 20 years old at this time, radicalized by a sect of religion at 20

104
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,280
 years old. And this 20 year old is about to experiencing something that he's

105
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,880
 never experienced before. Let's read on. Verse 3, "As he neared Damascus on his

106
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,080
 journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. He fell to the ground

107
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,880
 and he heard a voice say to him, 'Saul, Saul'" I've said this before at the Vine, I'm

108
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,760
 gonna keep saying it, "If the Lord ever says your name twice, watch out. 'Saul, Saul,

109
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,840
 why do you persecute me?' 'Who are you, Lord?' Saul asked. 'I am Jesus, whom you are

110
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,120
 persecuting,' he replied. 'Now get up and go into the city and you will be told

111
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,920
 what you must do.'" I love the way that Luke describes this moment for us. Luke

112
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,160
 is riding axe, right? And he describes this moment. He uses specific language in

113
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,280
 the Greek. That was very important to link this moment right back to the

114
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,320
 opening of the Bible in Genesis. The Greek version of the Bible that Luke and

115
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,320
 many others would have read had the same words in Genesis 1 as he uses now in

116
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,960
 this moment. "A light that flashes from heaven and the ground that Paul falls

117
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,440
 upon." The ground being like that Adama, the ground from which God created

118
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,600
 humanity. That light that came and broke into the darkness just like in Genesis

119
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,120
 1. Luke is trying to connect the reader back to that moment because here's what

120
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,840
 Luke is saying. Guess what? Watch out. This is amazing. God's about to do a new

121
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,760
 creation. There's about to be a moment of new creation. I can almost sense

122
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,400
 that Luke has a big bucket of popcorn. He's like, "This is amazing. Can't you see

123
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,320
 what's happening here?" Paul, many years later, would write to the church and he

124
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,560
 would say, "If anybody is in Christ Jesus, you've become a new creation. The old is

125
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,320
 gone. The new has come. He experiences it in this moment. This is his new

126
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:23,360
 creation." Jesus says this to him, "So, so, why do you persecute me?" I love that. He

127
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,080
 doesn't say, "So, so, why do you persecute my people?" He doesn't say, "Why do you

128
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,960
 persecute my church?" He says, "Why are you persecuting me?" Because Jesus is

129
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,680
 establishing something for the early church to understand as Luke writes this

130
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,280
 to the church. He's establishing something. He's saying, "If you mess with

131
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,160
 my people, you mess with me. If you're coming against my people, guess what?

132
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,840
 You're not just coming against my people. You're actually coming against me." Many

133
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,560
 years later, Paul would say, "We're the body of Christ." And here in this moment,

134
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,680
 Jesus is saying, "You hurt my body. You hurt me. I feel it. I'm not just aware of

135
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,920
 it. I feel it myself." Jesus identifies with his suffering people, his hurting

136
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,200
 children. That's what he does. He identifies with you. And that's great

137
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,840
 news if you're in this room right now and you're feeling tired or hurt or

138
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,840
 worn down or oppressed. If you're in this room right now and you're lonely. If

139
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,320
 you're in this room and you feel like nobody understands you. If you're in this

140
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,560
 room or watching online right now and you're going through a time of mourning

141
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,480
 or grief and you're wondering if anybody connects at all with you. God doesn't

142
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,440
 just see where you are. If you're a Christian in this room or online right

143
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,560
 now, he feels you. And he so personally connects himself to you that when

144
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,880
 something happens to you, it's as if it's happening to him. And it's like he's

145
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,640
 coming to pull and he's saying, "Back off. Because if you touch my people, you're

146
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,240
 touching me. And I'm gonna show up, bolt of lightning, and put you on the ground,

147
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,320
 buddy. Why are you persecuting me?" That should be encouraging to some of you

148
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,760
 today. There's a God who's not just aware of your predicament, but is fighting

149
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:12,240
 battles on your behalf. Because he loves you and he identifies so personally with

150
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:23,680
 you that when you hurt, he hurts. Paul's response is awesome. "Who are you, Lord?"

151
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,760
 The irony of this is so beautiful. If there was one person in all of Israel,

152
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,920
 one person who should have known who the Messiah was, there's one person who had

153
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,760
 studied the Old Testament prophetic words about the Messiah more than anyone

154
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,240
 else. If there is one person who has dedicated his life to protecting the

155
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,120
 coming of the Messiah, if there's one person who wants to make sure that

156
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,520
 Israel is the best prepared for the reality of the coming of the Messiah, if

157
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,600
 there's one person who knows who the Messiah is, it is Paul. And when the

158
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,200
 Messiah shows up, he has no idea. "Who are you, Lord? I have no idea who you are." And

159
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,560
 this teaches the church, us today, something so important. You can know

160
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,840
 about Jesus, but never have met him. You can know something of him. You can know

161
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,480
 an idea of him. You can even study him. You can even come to church on a regular

162
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,840
 basis and hear somebody teach you about Jesus. You can even open the Bible and

163
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,680
 you can read about Jesus, but there's a difference between a knowledge of Jesus

164
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,080
 and an encounter with him. And Paul had somehow got himself so lost in the

165
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,000
 study and in the thinking that he had completely missed the reality of the

166
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,080
 person when he actually showed up. "Who are you, Lord?" Years later, Paul would be

167
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,480
 in Athens and he would sit with the philosophers in Athens and he would say,

168
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,080
 "I've walked around your city. There's even an inscription there that says, 'To an

169
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,720
 unknown God.'" Here's the great travesty of the global church right now, that we are

170
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:04,240
 in danger of worshiping an unknown God. I think sometimes the churches can get

171
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,280
 filled with people who are excited about singing songs and studying and hearing

172
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:17,520
 and learning, but have stopped short from actually meeting. I want to invite you,

173
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:24,720
 not to just know about Jesus, but to encounter him, to make it a regular

174
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,120
 experience of yours, to have a friendship with Jesus, to know his

175
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,960
 presence in your life. And I tell you what, there's nothing wrong with study. I

176
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,000
 studied the heck out of this passage to preach to you today. I spent hours

177
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,600
 looking at it in the Greek. I spent hours looking at it in the commentaries. I

178
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,600
 understand this passage as best I can, but if you leave here today going, "Oh, I

179
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,800
 learned something today," my heart will be broken. I hope you leave today going, "I

180
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,880
 met Jesus." There's that moment, isn't there, in Luke 24 when those two disciples

181
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,200
 have just experienced Jesus, and Jesus has just talked to them about the

182
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,120
 Scriptures, and afterwards they don't go, "Wow, didn't we just learn something?"

183
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,720
 Afterwards they said, "Were our hearts not burning inside of us as we encountered

184
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,200
 the risen Lord?" My prayer is that your heart would burn inside of you. "Who are

185
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:20,920
 you, Lord?" He cries out. Well, he's about to find out. Look what happens next. Verse

186
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,240
 7, "The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless. They heard the sound,

187
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,200
 but they did not see anyone. Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his

188
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,720
 eyes, he could not see anything. He saw nothing. So they led him by the hand into

189
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,480
 Damascus, and for three days he was blind and did not eat or drink anything."

190
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,120
 Notice what happens here in this moment of incredible change for Paul. He

191
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,880
 suddenly is then lifted up by the companions that were walking with him,

192
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,080
 and he opens his eyes, but he sees nothing. And it's actually described by

193
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,400
 Luke here that he is this way. He's blind. Although his eyes are open, he's blind

194
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,440
 for three days. Now, whenever you read three days in the New Testament, your

195
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,360
 heart should stop immediately, and it should trigger something for you. This is

196
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:14,400
 Saul, Paul's tomb moment. This is Paul in a moment of his death and his resurrection.

197
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,000
 For three days, his eyes were opened and he was blind. And Luke is trying to

198
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,960
 communicate something. He's trying to say this. This is what our spiritual condition

199
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,280
 is like before we meet Jesus. Before we meet Jesus, here's what life is like. Our

200
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,480
 eyes are open, but we are actually not seeing the world as it truly should be

201
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
 seen. We're actually not seeing the value in humanity that we really should see.

202
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,000
 We're actually not seeing what society could become. We're actually not seeing

203
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,520
 love in the way that we should see it. We're actually not encountering people

204
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,280
 in the way that we should encounter them. It's only through the lens of Jesus

205
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,480
 Christ, through his salvation and our restoration in him, that we come to see

206
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,000
 the world as it truly was created to be seen. Before then, we are opened in our

207
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,640
 eyes, but we perceive nothing. And Luke is trying to say this is the condition that

208
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,680
 Paul was in, not just for three days, but this is his spiritual blindness that

209
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,520
 he's been in for years. His own passion and his study and his radicalization had

210
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,920
 closed his spiritual eyes to the reality of who the Messiah is. And so the Messiah

211
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,480
 has to show up, flash around him, bring him to his knees, rise him up and cause

212
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,960
 him to be blind for him to realize that he had gotten it all wrong. Now I want

213
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,680
 you to put yourself in the sandals of Paul right now. He's in some random house

214
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:47,280
 in Damascus blind and he feels terrible. Imagine a Pharisee. The one thing a

215
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,320
 Pharisee wants in life is to protect his people for their arrival of the Messiah.

216
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,040
 The one thing a Pharisee wants more than anything is to usher in the Messiah and

217
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,680
 to prepare his people for the Messiah. And Paul realizes he's just

218
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,360
 dedicated the early years of his life. He's just actually seen the stoning of

219
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,160
 Stephen and he's done it all to the ones who are actually the real people of the

220
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,080
 Messiah. That him and his pharisaical buddies had gotten it all wrong. That

221
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,860
 actually Jesus was the Son of God. He's suddenly realizing that what they

222
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,360
 thought was a false prophet is actually really the Son of God. He's suddenly

223
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,880
 realizing that who he thought was dead is actually well and truly alive because

224
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,520
 he's just spoken to him and he's just encountered them. And more than that, he's

225
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,480
 realizing that he has murdered the Messiah's people. And if you're a Pharisee

226
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,160
 and you come into the realization that you've actually murdered the very people

227
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,600
 of the very Son of God, that is the worst thing that could ever happen to you. And

228
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,400
 it says here that he refused to eat and drink for three days. Now when you fast

229
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,280
 you just refuse food, but if you don't drink you die. So what Luke is trying to

230
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:06,840
 tell us here is Paul wants to die. It's over for him. It's done. How could I ever

231
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,120
 live knowing that I persecuted not just the Son of God but his people as well

232
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,200
 and he refused to eat or drink and he was ready to die.

233
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:28,400
 Here's Paul going, "How could God ever forgive me and how could the Messiah's

234
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,000
 real people ever embrace me?" Well enter into the story the one person who

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,520
 changes history. Let's have a read. Is everybody okay? In Damascus there was a

236
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,560
 disciple named Ananias. I love how Luke does this. He's just done this incredible

237
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,560
 story up to this point and then very quietly he says, "In Damascus there was a

238
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:00,640
 disciple called Ananias." I love this because what Luke is telling you is he's

239
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,800
 saying this one was the very person that Paul had come to Damascus to arrest. He

240
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,520
 had gone to Damascus with authority of the high priest to arrest anybody there

241
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,800
 who believed in Jesus and this is one who believed in Jesus in Damascus. This

242
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,040
 is one. In fact Paul would write about him later or speak about him later in

243
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,180
 Acts chapter 2 and he would say he was a passionate follower of Jesus and had the

244
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,400
 respect of all the Jewish people in Damascus. So Ananias was quite well known

245
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,040
 in Damascus. Ananias would have been a prime target for the murderous Paul. This

246
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,720
 was the person he went there with these letters to arrest and drag back to

247
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,320
 Jerusalem and put on trial and hopefully see stone and this is such a beautiful

248
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,520
 irony in this story. Note this, the very one who was supposed to become a

249
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,160
 prisoner is about to be the very one who's going to set the actual prisoner

250
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:00,600
 free. Come on church. The one who should have been locked up under Paul's old

251
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,560
 regime is about to be the very one that's actually going to set Paul free

252
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:12,060
 because it's Paul who is in prison. It's Paul who's in the chains and behind

253
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,440
 the bars of his sin and his pride and his selfish ambition that has blinded

254
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,000
 him to the reality of the Messiah around him and it's Ananias who is free. It's

255
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,960
 Ananias who has all the freedom, who has come into relationship with Jesus, who

256
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,280
 knows who he is, who has that intimate relational connection to him, who knows

257
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,480
 that his own sins have been forgiven and Ananias has this understanding because

258
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,880
 he's like I was a sinner. I was an enemy of God but God in Jesus through

259
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,720
 his death and resurrection has now set me free and I am free not just to

260
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,520
 receive salvation but I am free now to be a minister of that salvation to

261
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,080
 anyone that God allows me to be around. I am so grateful that I am not prisoned to

262
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:03,840
 my sin and death anymore. The one who is in prison wants to kill himself and God

263
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:13,240
 so loves the world that he sends not just his only son but the children of

264
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,920
 the Son. Look what happens next. The Lord called to him and said this in a vision

265
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:28,160
 "Ananias!" "Yes Lord" he answered. Luke very beautifully does this. He does exactly

266
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,960
 the same words that were used for Paul's moment on the Damascus Road. Paul had a

267
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,080
 vision of the Lord. Paul heard the Lord's voice but Paul's response was "Who are

268
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,720
 you Lord?" Ananias has a vision. Ananias hears the Lord's voice. His response?

269
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,960
 "Yes Lord." "Yes Lord, what's up?" "I'm here." I mean Ananias had no idea what God was

270
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,080
 about to ask him to do okay and I think if he did know that he might have not

271
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,840
 said yes in that particular moment but he's blind to that right now. He's a

272
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,300
 little bit not aware but God shows up and says "Ananias!" Remember he only says

273
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,600
 his name once. Praise God. "Ananias!" Ananias' response is "Yes Lord! I'm ready. It's

274
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,200
 another day. I can't wait. What do you want me to do today?" "All right. You want to

275
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:19,000
 know what you're gonna do today?" The Lord said to him this "Go to the house of

276
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,880
 Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man there from Tarsus named Saul for he

277
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,040
 is praying." He's not praying, he's dying. In a vision he has seen a man named

278
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,720
 Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight. "Lord let's just

279
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,080
 pause there for a moment Lord." Ananias says. "Lord we need to chat about this a

280
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,520
 little bit. I've heard many reports about this man and all the harm that he's done

281
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,160
 to your saints in Jerusalem. I was so glad he was in Jerusalem but now he's

282
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,440
 come here and that's not great because he's got authority from the high

283
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
 priest and the chief priest and he's gonna arrest all of us that call on your

284
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,680
 name. So I just want to get this clear Lord. You're talking about a different

285
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,400
 Saul from the one I'm thinking right? There's lots of Saul's aren't there Lord?

286
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,920
 This is a common Hebrew name right now. Like this is not that guy right? It's

287
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:14,320
 amazing isn't it how how God's ability for grace always far exceeds ours. It's so

288
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,160
 easy isn't it for us to wonder "Ah that person. Never that one. Oh really have you

289
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,240
 seen what they've said and done?" And understandably Ananias is here going

290
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,280
 like "Man really like that one?" And I love what we see here in Ananias. We see

291
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,560
 somebody who's not afraid to question God. Not afraid to go "Let's just pause

292
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,160
 for a little bit here before I rush into my own death." Can we talk about this for

293
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,800
 a moment? Am I hearing you right? Like that one is this is this really what's

294
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,880
 on your heart? "But the Lord said to Ananias go hmm for this man is my chosen

295
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,380
 instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the

296
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,840
 people of Israel. I will show him how much he must suffer for my name." And

297
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,820
 Ananias is is wrestling with God in this moment saying "Okay I think I know what

298
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,860
 you need me to do but seriously this one could kill me. He's come here to do that.

299
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,560
 I'm not sure if I really can go." And God says "No you need to go and guess what?

300
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:18,600
 This one is my chosen instrument." And I think Ananias is wrestling with this

301
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,280
 because he's like "Do I really need to go?" And Jesus says to him "I want you to go

302
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,000
 and place your hands on him and pray for him so his sight is restored.

303
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,880
 I want you to place your hands upon this man, minister to him so his sight will be

304
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,160
 restored." And here's Ananias going "Is there any other way?" Now think about it.

305
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,000
 There was another way. You see Jesus didn't have to do it this way. Jesus

306
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,620
 showed up to Paul and did this amazing thing. Light from heaven, fall on the

307
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,520
 ground, raise him back up. What Jesus could have done in that moment is

308
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,600
 immediately restored his sight, forgiven him of his sins, filled him with the Holy

309
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,880
 Spirit and set him off to be the conqueror of the Greek Roman Empire.

310
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,160
 That's what he could have done. It was within Jesus's power but Jesus did not

311
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,320
 decide to do it that way. Instead he blinds Paul, puts him in a place of

312
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,000
 abject terror for three days, raises up another person to go along to pray for

313
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 him. And the question we should be asking is why does God do it that way? It's

314
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 because God is teaching his church something. He's trying to tell his church

315
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,540
 that when the Spirit of God falls upon the church, you will be my witnesses to

316
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,560
 the end of the earth. You will be my hands and feet. I could have done it on

317
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,380
 the road but I want to do it through Ananias. See as Christians we are to be

318
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,720
 ministers. Ministers of the transformative power of Jesus Christ.

319
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:53,240
 Ones who are led by the Spirit of God to meet souls and invite them to

320
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,500
 become Paul's. That's what we've been invited to do. That's why we've been

321
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,960
 saved by Jesus. So that we can partner with the Spirit of God and come

322
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,780
 alongside of people who might be soul in this moment and believe that they

323
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,400
 could become Paul's. Ones that could change empires. Ones that could do all of

324
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,120
 this stuff. And here's Ananias and he senses that God has called him beyond

325
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,120
 just what he does in his normal life. And now he gets to participate through the

326
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,720
 simple obedience of the Holy Spirit to lay his hands on someone and see that

327
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,560
 person's life transform. And you need to be really careful that you

328
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,800
 don't think Ananias is some super apostle. His name is never heard about

329
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:40,400
 in the rest of human history from this point forward. But God says to him, "Paul

330
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:46,320
 will be my chosen instrument. I'm gonna use him to transform the Greco-Roman

331
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,400
 Empire. He's gonna take the gospel to the Gentiles, to their kings and rulers, and

332
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,400
 he's gonna take it to all the people of Israel." And Ananias is trying to get his

333
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:03,080
 head around this. And Ananias realizes that it's not just Paul who's the chosen

334
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,400
 instrument here. He's also a chosen instrument. That God has also called him,

335
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,500
 equipped him, empowered him, and released him, and asked him to go. And he realizes

336
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,480
 I get a part to play in the unfolding dramatic movement of God's gospel in the

337
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,880
 world. It's not just Paul who's a chosen instrument. I too have been chosen by him

338
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,040
 to just do one simple thing. Meet one person with the courage of not being

339
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,040
 killed, lay my hand on his shoulder, pray that he receives the Holy Spirit, and

340
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:42,360
 watch what God will do. Oh man. Note this. Without Ananias, there would have been no

341
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,920
 Paul. Without Ananias, there would have been no half of the New Testament.

342
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,880
 Without Ananias, perhaps the gospel would only have ever gone as far as Samaria.

343
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,800
 Ananias was willing to lay his hands on someone, not aware of all that

344
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,200
 God is about to do through him, to actually change the course of human

345
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:13,420
 history, which is what Paul does. And it starts because of somebody who is

346
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:23,160
 forgotten in history, but is obedient to the simple call to be a Christian. You

347
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:30,080
 need to know that large doors swing on small hinges. And I look around this room

348
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,000
 right now and I see a lot of small hinges. The potential in this room for

349
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,720
 what God could do through people who are willing to just lay their hands on

350
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:50,000
 someone, pray for them, is unfathomable. Could you imagine what the future of

351
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,200
 Hong Kong might look like if there are just a few more Ananiases and not Pauls

352
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,200
 in this place? This idea of being a chosen instrument becomes a fundamental

353
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,800
 perspective of the early church. Let me read to you just a passage that Peter

354
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,040
 writes just a few years later to the church. He writes this. He says, "But you

355
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,520
 are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people who belong to God,

356
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,520
 that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his

357
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,840
 wonderful light." This is Peter pulling up these very moments from Acts chapter 9

358
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,520
 and then applying them to the whole church. He's saying, "Don't you realize

359
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,880
 it's not just Paul. We, the whole of us, are a chosen people. We're a holy nation."

360
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,360
 And guess what? Just like Ananias, we get to see people go out of darkness into

361
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,120
 incredible light. We get to be the ones who do the simple work of laying hands

362
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,920
 on people. Get to see God do amazing things. We are a chosen people.

363
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,960
 And it's almost like Peter is writing to the church and saying, "Rise up.

364
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,920
 Rise up with your God-given authority. You don't need letters from the chief

365
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:04,440
 priests. You just need your hands and your hearts." This is the joy of being a

366
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,920
 Christ follower. I don't know if you've ever thought of it this way.

367
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,680
 This is the joy of being a Christ follower. We are a chosen instrument of

368
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,400
 God's good news, equipped with the ability to lay our hands on people, pray

369
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,000
 for them, and see people move out of darkness into God's great new light.

370
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,640
 That's who you are. Every single person in this room. A few years ago, me and my

371
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,120
 friend Dogan went out to pray here in Wan Chai. We wanted to go and pray for

372
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,640
 street sleepers. Dogan was an amazing guy, is an amazing guy. He now lives in the US.

373
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,160
 But amazing guy. American-born Chinese. Had a terrible upbringing. Really hard

374
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,960
 life. Drugs throughout his teenage life. Drug addict into his early 20s. Came to a

375
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,080
 dramatic conversion experience with Jesus Christ and had heard about

376
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,760
 Jackie Pullinger's ministry here in Hong Kong. He left his work and left

377
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,480
 his family in California. He moved out here so that he could, in his early 20s,

378
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,640
 minister with Jackie, with the drug addicts of Hong Kong. After that, he came

379
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,200
 and was a part of the Vine community. Him and his family were a part of this

380
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,960
 community for many years. Dogan served in many different ways. On this

381
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,480
 one particular day, him and I, we went out to Wan Chai. We were looking for

382
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,960
 street sleepers. We went into Southern Playground, just over here. We

383
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,560
 looked up into the stadium part of Southern Playground. We saw this man

384
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,560
 sitting up there. He very much looked like a street sleeper. Dogan's like,

385
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,320
 "I think that could be the guy." I'm like, "Yep, let's go." So we went up there.

386
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,840
 We sat down. Dogan began to speak to him in Cantonese. Just began to

387
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,360
 share, I guess, a little bit about his story and who he was. He shared with

388
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,120
 this man. After about five minutes of chatting back and forth in Cantonese,

389
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,360
 Dogan asked him if he could pray for him. The man was like, "Whatever.

390
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,720
 If that's what you want to do." So I reached out and put my hand on his

391
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,880
 left shoulder. Dogan reached out and put his hand on his right shoulder. We

392
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,160
 started to pray. Dogan prayed in Cantonese over this guy. I didn't

393
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,840
 really know what they were saying. I didn't understand Cantonese at that

394
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,360
 level. Didn't really understand it. But I began to pray just in myself.

395
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,640
 Immediately as I began to pray, I felt the Holy Spirit say this, "Hey, Andrew,

396
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,280
 you're wearing a cross." I'm like, "Yeah." He's like, "Okay, I want you to take off

397
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,440
 your cross and give it to this man." In that moment, I had an Ananias

398
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,440
 moment. I was like, "Let's just talk about this for a moment, God. Because this man

399
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,800
 is not even a Christian. Why would I waste this cross on him?

400
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:33,800
 Secondly, my wife gave me this cross. I like this cross. This cross has

401
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,560
 sentimental value to me. It's an important cross. I'm not just gonna

402
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,000
 randomly take this off and give it to a guy who like five minutes later is gonna

403
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,920
 throw it in the bin." So I was kind of having that

404
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,400
 conversation with God whilst I was praying for this man. After a few

405
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 minutes, Dogan turns to me. He's been praying in Cantonese. He turns to me in

406
00:33:50,400 --> 00:34:01,080
 English. He says, "Are you sensing anything?" I'm like, "Yeah, unfortunately I am." I said,

407
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,240
 "Yeah, I sense that the Holy Spirit wants me to take off my cross and give it

408
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,160
 to him." As I said those words, Dogan just looked at me and he didn't blink for

409
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,360
 like ages. I was worried about him. He goes, "Man, I've been praying in

410
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,280
 Cantonese over this guy for like the last five minutes, but the whole time I've

411
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,720
 been praying, God has been telling me to give my cross that I'm wearing on my

412
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,560
 neck to him, but I told God, 'No, my wife gave it to me.'" We had exactly the same

413
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,640
 conversation with God. God was probably standing back there going, "Look at

414
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:42,400
 my unfaithful servants! One of you give your cross!" Anyway, so I'm like, "I think I'd

415
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,200
 better give him my cross." And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, you do that, Andrew. You give

416
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,960
 me your cross. I'll keep praying in Cantonese." So he keeps praying in

417
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,560
 Cantonese, and I take off my cross, and he's explained to the guy what God

418
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,440
 was saying. And the guy unbuttons his shirt, and he's wearing three big fat

419
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,480
 Buddhist medallion idol type stuff on his neck, the big fat ones.

420
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,720
 And he starts to take them off, and as he lifts them up towards about

421
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,360
 eye level, he suddenly starts manifesting a demon. He starts acting demonically,

422
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,080
 manifesting literally a demon. Now, I had seen this a few times, and Dalgan had

423
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,800
 seen this a lot, and here was the fascinating thing. The demon decided to

424
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,960
 speak in English. I was the only one in that party that didn't speak Cantonese,

425
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,560
 so the demon wanted me to know how angry and upset he was at this situation. And

426
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,480
 this demon, I will not repeat what came out of this man's mouth. The man

427
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,120
 obviously didn't speak any English, but this demon with English began to curse

428
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,600
 us out like anything I'd never heard. And Dalgan starts to have a fight with him

429
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,520
 in English back, but not with the guy, but with the demon, and starts to like shout

430
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,720
 back, and it's like Street Fighter in real life, you know. And then he prays, "In

431
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,360
 the name of Jesus, be gone." And this guy just immediately throws his head back

432
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:11,880
 and starts crying tears, and I know that these are tears of freedom. And he takes

433
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,520
 my cross, and he puts it over his neck where those Buddhist symbols had been,

434
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:22,000
 and the demon is gone. Not because I'm special, or because Dalgan's special. I know

435
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,720
 I'm a pastor, so that story makes you think, "Okay, well he's a pastor. That was

436
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,440
 long before I was a pastor." We're not special, but we were vessels that day.

437
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,360
 And sitting in this room are vessels of God's glory waiting to be unleashed. Let

438
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,640
 me close by showing you one more thing, and then we're gonna do this practical

439
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,480
 exercise. Is everybody okay still? Two more minutes. Verse 17, "Then Ananias went to

440
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,760
 the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, 'Brother Saul, the

441
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,320
 Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here has sent me

442
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,760
 so that you may be able to see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.'

443
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,240
 Immediately something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again,

444
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,920
 and he got up, and he was baptized, and after taking some food, he regained his

445
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,640
 strength. He didn't want to die anymore because he had come into resurrection

446
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,840
 hope through the power of the Holy Spirit. All Ananias did was place his

447
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,320
 hand on his shoulder, and then he says these two words. What a powerful thing. He

448
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,640
 says this, "Brother Saul." Could you imagine what those words would have meant to

449
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,840
 Paul? Paul who's wrestling with the reality that God's people could never

450
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,160
 forgive him, who's wrestling with the reality that God will never forgive him,

451
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,240
 and that he was killing people of the Messiah, and here a people of the Messiah

452
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,120
 shows up, and the very first thing he says to Paul is, "You're my brother. I love

453
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,880
 you. You're part of this family. If God's forgiven you, I've forgiven you, and

454
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,280
 guess what? Not only that, I'm about to lay my hands on you, and I'm gonna pray

455
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,200
 that the Spirit of God will come upon you because His grace is sufficient for

456
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,080
 you." This room is filled with Ananiases waiting to be unleashed in your sphere

457
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,080
 of influence, your workplace, your families here in Hong Kong in this

458
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,320
 desperate hour. Would we rise up, lay hands on one another, and pray that the

459
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,120
 Spirit of God would take people from darkness into light? Now here's how we're

460
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,640
 gonna do that. In a moment, I'm gonna invite us all to stand, and then I'm

461
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,440
 gonna pray for the Holy Spirit to come. We're just gonna have a time just

462
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,080
 privately to receive the Holy Spirit. If you're watching this online right now,

463
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,120
 our online team are just about to drop in your chat box a link to Zoom, where

464
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,000
 you could go from just watching this one way to actually being in a room with

465
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,200
 people who are gonna be doing exactly what I'm gonna be talking about here. So

466
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,840
 just have a look in the chat box right now for the instructions for that Zoom.

467
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,880
 But what we're doing in this room is you're gonna have a moment where I'm

468
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,200
 just gonna pray for the Holy Spirit to come, and you're gonna receive the Holy

469
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,840
 Spirit, and then after that I'm gonna invite you to turn to the person

470
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,360
 sitting next to you, whether you know them or not, and you're gonna say, "Hi, so

471
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,880
 nice to meet you," and then you're gonna ask them, "How can I pray for you?" And

472
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,880
 then you're gonna lay your hands on their shoulders, and I don't care about

473
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,440
 COVID. You're gonna lay your hands on their shoulder, and you're gonna pray for

474
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,920
 them, and then after that they're gonna ask you, "How can I pray for you?" And

475
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,040
 you're gonna share what's on your heart, and then they're gonna lay their hands

476
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,040
 on you, and they're gonna pray for you. And I cannot wait to see the potential

477
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,480
 of what it is that the Holy Spirit is about to do in this room. So I wonder

478
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,200
 whether you would stand with me, and we're gonna do this together. I want to

479
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,400
 pray for us first. If you stand, I just want to invite you to open your hands.

480
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,840
 Holy Spirit, thank you. Just open your hands with me right now. We got time to

481
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:55,960
 do this. We don't need to rush. Holy Spirit, would you come? Holy Spirit, we're

482
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,920
 so grateful. Come, Lord Jesus, come.

483
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:10,080
 Father, I'm so grateful for the people of this room, and the people that are

484
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:19,040
 watching online, and going into a Zoom right now. Holy Spirit, come. Father, would

485
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:28,200
 you fill us? We're tired, weary, being beaten down by the last few years. We

486
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,800
 need you, Lord.

487
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:37,280
 Father, sometimes our eyes are open, and we see nothing. Would you remove the

488
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,920
 scales from our eyes, Lord? Would your Holy Spirit come now?

489
00:40:42,920 --> 00:41:01,040
 Just receive the Holy Spirit.

490
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,160
 Come, Jesus, come.

491
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:28,960
 He loves you so much. He saved you. A small hinge,

492
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,200
 who through the power of the Spirit of God can move great doors.

493
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:46,440
 You, who can place your hands on those possessed by demons and see them flee.

494
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:53,320
 You, who can place your hands on someone who's struggling emotionally, and offer

495
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,760
 them peace.

496
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,360
 You, who can place your hands on those you don't even know, and just speak a word

497
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:09,760
 of comfort and love through the power of the Holy Spirit.

498
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:17,480
 But before you do that, receive yourself.

499
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,080
 Come, Lord Jesus, come.

500
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:28,080
 [praying in tongues]

501
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
 More, Lord.
