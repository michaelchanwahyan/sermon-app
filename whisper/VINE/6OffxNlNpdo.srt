1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Amen. Hey, can we give a round of applause to our worship team, to one another. Have a seat. It is so good that you are with us today.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 If you're new to the Vine, my name is Andrew, one of the pastors here. We're so glad you're here.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 If you're joining us online for one of the first times, we're so glad you're here with us as well.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 We're in week three of our series on the book of Philippians called An Alternative Society, where we're looking at and reminding ourselves of Paul's vision for the church.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Particularly his vision for the church as it was found in a very important time of history.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 The early church, a church, particularly the church in Philippi, that was struggling under the persecution around it.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Their belief in Jesus was coming into conflict and tension with the cultures and the norms of their society.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 That Jesus and Caesar were finding themselves clashing.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 And Paul writes this incredible letter, as we know it, Philippians, to a church of 30 or so people meeting in a house and saying to them,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 "You hold in your hands, gathered together, a fresh new vision for life."

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And in this letter, he's passionate to help the church remind the church that they are the hands and feet, the character and the life of Christ in society.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 He doesn't want them to be buckled under the pressure of persecution.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 He doesn't want them to succumb to the growing pressures and divisions that were in reality happening amongst them within the church.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Instead, he wants them to recapture God's heart for the kingdom of God and for showing Jesus to society.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 And I can't think of a better book in a better time for us to look as we think about what it is to be church in Hong Kong in this hour.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 What does it mean for us to live in this time to hold forth the gospel, to shine like stars in the universe?

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 In Luke chapter 8, verse 1, we talked about the citizenship that Paul speaks of to the church in Philippi.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 There's citizenship in heaven.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And he says when it comes down to it, you are not citizens of Rome.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 You're not citizens of Italy.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 You're not citizens under ultimately the authority of Caesar.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 You're citizens of heaven.

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And therefore, there is a character, a structure in which how we are to live.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And Paul says as we looked in the first week that we are to administer our public affairs.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Administer how we live, the ways in which we live in a way that is worthy of our citizenship in heaven.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 That we are to operate together with that in mind.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 In week 2, we looked at prayer.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Because Paul's idea is if we're citizens of heaven, if ultimately we administer the values of the kingdom on earth,

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 prayer is such a central part to that.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And we saw last week that Paul wasn't calling them to be this alternative society to pray in their usual ways.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 No, there was a new way to pray.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And Paul says it's not this laundry list of all the stuff that I need in my life where our prayers become so self-centered.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Instead, he says pray for one another.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Like make it your habit and your culture in this alternative society to believe the best for each other.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 To thank God for one another even when you don't like each other.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 To thank God for one another even when you're divided amongst each other.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 To believe God's blessings should come on all of you.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So that you can partner in the gospel because there's work to do.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And what kind of world or what kind of thing are we saying about Jesus to the world if we're divided and disunified ourselves?

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And he's saying here's how we can do that.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 We view each other not on the brokenness of our humanity in this moment.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But we view each other with a broader and bigger scale of the future that will happen when Christ comes back.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And present each one of us pure and blameless before him.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And if Christ has begun a good work in you, he will work through and carry it on all the way to completion.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So pray for that good work to happen in each other.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Are you okay?

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Isn't that a great vision that Paul has for the church?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Today I want to turn to the topic of leadership.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And I can't think of a more important time in history for us to be thinking about what it means for us to actually lead true and well.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 To lead as God would have us to lead.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Now I want to preface everything I'm saying here by the reality that some of you in this room,

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 as soon as I mention the idea of leadership, immediately you've begun to think about somebody else.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 You've maybe begun to think of your boss in your workplace, or the person who on their business card it says leader,

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 the one that has the authority and power.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 And you're immediately beginning to think of everybody else apart from yourself.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Here's the first thing you need to know.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 When scripture speaks about leadership within this church, this alternative society,

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 it's talking about a picture where all of us are seen as ones who have been gifted to be able to show the world what Jesus looks like.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 In other words, in scripture leadership is never just defined to one or two people in corridors of power or with defined levels of leadership.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 No, the gospel is for all.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And if the gospel is for all, every single one of us has a unique way of bringing an expression of that gospel.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 You yourself are a leader.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 If you're in this room or watching online right now and you're a Christian, God has saved you.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 He's reconciled you with God.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 He's placed his spirit in you.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 He's given you gifts and talents and he's left you here on earth for a purpose, for a reason.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Because you get to, in the image of God, express something of the nature of Christ,

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 of the character of Christ in your particular sphere of influence.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Remember that's a word we use a lot here at the Vine.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 If you've been coming to this church for a while, you would have heard me say so many times,

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 "You have a sphere of influence. Go to your sphere of influence. We pray for your sphere of influence."

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Leadership is essentially influence.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 It is the ability to bring influence on another person or a group of people

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 in order that you might accomplish together a shared goal or vision.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 That's a simple, clear definition of leadership.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 That every single one of us has this sphere of influence in our lives.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Really, to be a Christian is to bring something of Christ and his influence into those spheres around us

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 where together we might believe that we can work forward, have influence,

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 in order to show the world something of Christ Jesus.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Are you with me so far?

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So do not sit there thinking that this message is for the person sitting next to you

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 or it's for your boss at work or the person who has the business card or the resume.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 This is for you, for you are a leader in the kingdom of God.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Here's the second thing.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 We have an issue.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Because we have a crisis of leadership in the world right now.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I mean the world right now is suffering under a crisis of leadership.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Now of course there are good examples of leaders and leadership in every culture and in every society.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 But I don't know about you, but I've been struggling myself to see great, dynamic, good models of leadership around us in this time.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 In fact, it seems like everywhere we look right now that there's a breakdown in leadership.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The Pandora Papers that were released this week is just another reminder to us.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 12 million documents outlining some of the terrible ways in which key leaders in this world are leading with self-interest in mind.

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And we seem to have this structure in our society where basically modern leadership is in a crisis of trust and of abuse of power and of integrity.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 These three things, trust of our leadership, the abuse of power within modern leadership, and integrity.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Not being able to trust the word of people.

96
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Not believing that they're actually going to stand up and move forward in what they've actually said.

97
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 These are areas that leadership is crumbling around us.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Forbes magazine recently did a survey of everybody that attended a world economic forum.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And in this they asked them, "Is there a crisis of leadership in the world right now?"

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 85% of the people that attended this forum, which was a lot of people, all said yes.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 These are some of the key leaders in the world, some of the key economic leaders, some of the world's governing leaders.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 They all agreed, 85% of them, that there's a crisis in leadership.

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And out of this survey, Forbes were able to produce an article where they outlined five key traits of what they call toxic leadership.

104
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Five key traits. I want to highlight these for you.

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Here's the first one. Ego, vanity, and arrogance.

106
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 That toxic leaders are people that struggle with ego, vanity, and arrogance.

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 These are people that put themselves up in leadership as the experts in everything that they do.

108
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Therefore, they are not in a position to learn, not in a position to grow.

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 In fact, they think that their leadership is protected by pretending, in most cases, to be the expert at everything.

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 These kinds of toxic leaders have very low empathy, very low compassion,

111
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 and instead are much more aggressive in their communication.

112
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 And mostly, it's critical to lower someone down in order to cover for what they lack.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Ego, vanity, and arrogance.

114
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 The second trait was this, a deficiency of self-awareness.

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 That these kinds of leaders have the inability to actually recognize the flaws that are in them,

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 or if they know those flaws, they don't want to deal with them.

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 They're blind to them, they ignore them, even when those flaws are having a big impact on the people around them.

118
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 The third thing is achievement at all costs.

119
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 These kinds of leaders put achievement beyond everything else.

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 And the irony is that so often with these leaders, the very people that have worked so hard,

121
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 voted them in, worked on their behalf to get them into a place of power,

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 the people there then run those people over in order to achieve what it is that they need to achieve.

123
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 They burn bridges all around them because the number one thing is not the people that got them there,

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 the number one thing is them retaining power.

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Are you with me?

126
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Here's the fourth trait that they saw, power over competency.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Power over competency. It doesn't matter whether I'm not actually good in my job.

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 It doesn't matter whether I have the character to hold me in my platform.

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It doesn't matter if I actually have the skill set to administer this nation, this country, this business, this church well.

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 What matters is my power and holding onto that power for as long as I can.

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And so I will do whatever I want to be able to reestablish and reinforce my power,

132
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 even if it means pulling you down, because that will hide the reality that I actually don't have the competency to lead in the way that I need to lead.

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 The fifth and final one was self-interest beyond the idea of the greater good.

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Self-interest instead of looking out for the greater good.

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And what they found in this survey was that toxic leaders led this way most predominantly in times of pressure,

136
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 in times of hardship and difficulty, they would actually look after themselves more than the greater good of those that they were supposed to be serving.

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 These, my friends, are the five traits of the kind of crisis that I think leadership is in today.

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And if we're honest with ourselves, we would be open to say that we see this kind of leadership in the church

139
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 as much as we might see this kind of leadership in society, economics, and in the corridors of government.

140
00:11:48,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 It may well be that perhaps even you as being a part of this church here have come under these kinds of leadership traits from time to time.

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And before we think that this is a modern problem, we just need to open the pages a little bit of history

142
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 and realize that this is not just going to quickly and easily go away.

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 That we could look at this kind of list and go like, "I don't want to be that kind of leader. I'm not really that kind of leader. Am I that kind of leader?"

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 You might be suffering with that self-awareness thing, but anyway.

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 But like we look at this and we kind of think, "We're not going to be these kinds of leaders. Surely this is just a passing phase. We're all going to get through it."

146
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 When the reality is it's almost been 2,000 years of recorded history where this kind of leadership

147
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 has been the predominant type of leadership that's been seen in the world.

148
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 You just need to ask Paul what he saw in leadership around him in the first century.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And he would look at this list and go, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm."

150
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Oh yeah, that one too.

151
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Because the Greco-Roman culture, Greco-Roman leadership was very similar to this.

152
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 There was authoritarian dictatorship.

153
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 There was this kind of sort of ego-driven centrality to holding on to power.

154
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So much so that the Caesars demanded and forced worship of themselves in order to retain that kind of power.

155
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 There was a culture in the Greco-Roman culture where it was all about praising and boasting.

156
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And leaders would boast about themselves, what they were good at, all of the things that they were,

157
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 in order to deflect the reality that they weren't actually good at some things.

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 There was a culture here of the powerful gaining more power at the suppression of the poor and the minorities around them.

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 This was Greco-Roman cultural leadership.

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And Paul is looking at this, he's looking at his church,

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 and he's realizing that everybody in that church has been saved out of that kind of culture.

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And he's noticing in the divisions that are amongst them that that culture is alive too in the church.

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And Paul believes that there has to be another way.

164
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Because if we're going to be an alternative society, there has to be another way to lead.

165
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Paul himself encountered this new way.

166
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 In chapter 3 of Philippians, Paul writes of all of the things that he, if he wanted to boast, could boast about.

167
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Oh, if anybody had confidence in the flesh, oh, it's me.

168
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 I mean, I was born like this. I was part of this tribe. I was raised under this teacher.

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I went to Harvard. I went to Cambridge. I went to Oxford. I got my PhD. I'm awesome.

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Like if anybody had power and privilege, a leader amongst his own people,

171
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 one that was feared by many people, a Pharisee of the Pharisee, it was Paul.

172
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And that was his thinking. That was his leadership style.

173
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And then he's on his way to Damascus. Jesus shows up and everything changes.

174
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And he suddenly realizes that there's a new way to lead.

175
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 That power is immediately redefined.

176
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 That the power that he thought he had, the power that he thought he needed for leadership is completely removed.

177
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 That power is redefined in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And Paul begins to understand that power is not about exerting influence from outside.

179
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Power is all about what God's doing from within.

180
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Like power is the thing that God is doing by His Spirit to change and transform us from the inside.

181
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Because if you want to change a culture and a society and a world, you change its people.

182
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And Paul begins to look at Jesus and talks to the apostles about the life of Jesus.

183
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And he realizes that Jesus came to model a new way of leadership.

184
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Paul hears crazy ideas like this from Jesus.

185
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 That the last will be first and the first will be last.

186
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 That the greatest amongst you needs to be the servant of all.

187
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 That it is the meek that will inherit the earth.

188
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 That there is no more male or female or Gentile or Jew, but we're all one in Christ Jesus.

189
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Paul begins to pull the threads together of this kind of leadership.

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And he's beginning to say there is a new way.

191
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And he's looking at the church in Philippi.

192
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And he's saying if you're truly going to be an alternative society, it's time for you to begin to lead differently.

193
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 So I want to turn to this vision that Paul has for leadership this morning.

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And open this up for us as a challenge to us to think differently ourselves about leadership in our own lives.

195
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Everybody okay? You alright online? I can see the cameras nodding. Great.

196
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Let me read this to you from Philippians 1 starting in verse 12.

197
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 "Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.

198
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 As a result, it's become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.

199
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.

201
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.

202
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in my chains.

203
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 But what does it matter? The important thing is this, that whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached.

204
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And because of this, you know what? I rejoice. Yes, I'm going to continue to rejoice.

205
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 For I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

206
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 what has happened to me will turn out for my salvation, my deliverance.

207
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be put to shame, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always,

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.

209
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 For me to live is Christ, but to die is gain.

210
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 If I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me.

211
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Yet I don't know what to choose. I just don't know.

212
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I'm torn between the two. You know, I desire on the one side to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far,

213
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 but it is more necessary for me to remain in the body for you.

214
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Convinced of this, I will therefore remain.

215
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And I will continue with all of you for your progress and for your joy in the faith,

216
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 so that through my being with you again, your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.

217
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Paul tells them in this passage, he reminds them of where he's at.

218
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 He starts out in verse 12. He says, "There's a palace guard around me. I'm in chains for Christ Jesus."

219
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 He's really clear that his situation is tough.

220
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Now, a couple of things you need to understand about being in prison in the first century.

221
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Prison in the first century wasn't where you went to after you had been judged and the sentence had been given to you.

222
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Prison was where you went whilst you were waiting for the judgment and waiting for the sentencing.

223
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And no one would ever get sentenced to time in prison.

224
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 They would either get sentenced to execution, or they would get sentenced to a fine and to be set free.

225
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Those were the extremes. No one ever went to jail for their sentence.

226
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 They went to jail to wait for the sentence. Does that make sense to you?

227
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 So here's Paul, and he's in a difficult situation.

228
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 He's waiting to find out if he's going to actually be sentenced to death.

229
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 He's finding out. This is why later on in verses 22 and 23, he's writing these words.

230
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 He's saying, "I might die." He has this reflection around life and death.

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 "Is this where I'm at? Am I going to die in the future? Am I going to live?

232
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 There's benefits of both. If I go to Christ, I'll get to have joy with Him.

233
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 If I don't die, I'll get to come back."

234
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And so he's struggling with the reality that the sentence may come that will force him to either into life or death.

235
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 This is a tough situation for him.

236
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And I want you to see something that's really important here.

237
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 In the middle of this tough situation, look at the language that he uses.

238
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Encouraged, courageously and fearlessly. Goodwill, love.

239
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Christ is preached. I rejoice. I'll continue to rejoice.

240
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 My deliverance, fruitful labor, joy in the faith, overflow.

241
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Look at these words. These are not words of a panicked leader.

242
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 These are not words of someone who thinks that he's suffering under the oppression of a system.

243
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And he's trying to fight that system.

244
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 He's trying to get kind of condolences from all the people around him.

245
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 No, this is Paul writing and saying, "It's not actually about my situation that truly matters.

246
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 What actually matters here is what's happening with the gospel."

247
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Paul never writes to the church and says, "Man, the food sucks in prison."

248
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Like somebody cry with me for a moment.

249
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 He never writes to the church and says, "Send me some blankets, Philippi, because it's really cold at night."

250
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Nowhere in the letter. Instead he writes to them.

251
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 He tells them he's in prison. And he has such joy in his heart

252
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 because he points beyond what is happening just around him

253
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 to the reality of what is happening kind of in his ministry.

254
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 He starts to say, "This is what's happening with the gospel."

255
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Notice what he says in verse 12.

256
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 He says, "Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me

257
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 has really served to advance the gospel."

258
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 In other words, he's saying, "It's not about me.

259
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 It's not about what's actually happening to me.

260
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 What's more important is what is taking place for the gospel."

261
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Paul is subverting worldly leadership here and walking in the opposite spirit.

262
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 This is his attitude for leadership. It's this.

263
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 That what happens in us and through us is way more important than what happens to us.

264
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Come on, church.

265
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 What happens in us and through us is way more important than what actually is happening to us.

266
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Paul is like, "Look at what's happening to me. I'm in chains. I'm in prison.

267
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I don't know whether I'm going to live or die.

268
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 They may pass a sentence where I'm executed. It doesn't matter.

269
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Do you want to know what really matters?

270
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Jesus is being preached. Do you want to know what really matters?

271
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 People are coming to Christ. The gospel is advancing.

272
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It's crazy to me that even in prison the gospel is still happening.

273
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 In fact, I'm in chains. Look at verse 14.

274
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 He says, "I'm in chains and because of those chains,

275
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 the brothers and sisters are preaching more courageously, more fearlessly."

276
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 He's like, "This is awesome."

277
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Are you seeing what he's doing?

278
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 See, in worldly toxic leadership, what happens in toxic leadership is

279
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 leaders shine the light on themselves and their circumstances

280
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 in order to secure power and authority,

281
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 but gospel leaders shine intentionally the light away from themselves.

282
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Paul's like, "It's not about what's going on for me.

283
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 What's more important is what the Spirit of God is doing in and through this situation.

284
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Look at how the gospel is growing.

285
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Look at what's taking place around me by the gospel.

286
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 This is amazing. I rejoice. I'm encouraged. I'm in love.

287
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 This is great."

288
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I don't know about you, but if I was in Paul's situation, man,

289
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I'd be asking you for blankets.

290
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Are you with me?

291
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 I would be looking for sympathy.

292
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I'd be trying to retain my power, if you will,

293
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 by having people feel sorry for my situation.

294
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Paul's subverting that whole thing, the ego, the arrogance,

295
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 the manipulation of others because of circumstance.

296
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 He's saying the thing that really matters is whether the gospel is preached or not.

297
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Now, Paul takes this now to another level.

298
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 It's not just about his circumstance and his situation

299
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 that he's trying to subvert and shine the light away from.

300
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 He also then has some things to say about his haters.

301
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 We all have haters, by the way.

302
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 You're a leader. Remember I said at the start of the message, you're a leader.

303
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 That means you're going to have to struggle with some haters.

304
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 You're going to have to struggle with some people that will disagree with you.

305
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 One of the struggles and the trials, but also the important things of leadership,

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 is that there'll be people around you that will question what you do.

307
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Over the last eight years that I've been senior pastor here,

308
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 one of the hardest things I've had to get used to is the fact that people

309
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 don't always agree with me, that they disagree with me.

310
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Sometimes they strongly disagree with me and they let me know that.

311
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Now, one of the skills of leadership is to be able to do what I call

312
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 "chew the meat and spit out the bones," right?

313
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 To listen effectively to the complaints that come about you

314
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 or about your organization, to understand those things.

315
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And sometimes they're legitimate and they're true and you should respond to them.

316
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 So there is that way that we are to humble ourselves under that.

317
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 But then there's also a lot of stuff that comes our way that isn't true, that isn't right,

318
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 that is designed to just pull you down, that actually hurts because it's personal

319
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 and things are said and it's not easy.

320
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And Paul moves on in verses 15 and 17 to talk about this.

321
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 He says it this way.

322
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 He says, "It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry,

323
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 but others out of goodwill.

324
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 The latter do so in love, knowing that I'm put here for the defense of the gospel.

325
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely,

326
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I'm in chains."

327
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 He's talking about two groups of people.

328
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 One group that were preaching Jesus with the right heart, the right motive, in goodwill.

329
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And he thinks that's great.

330
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 But he then points out this other group of people who are trying to stir up trouble against him,

331
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 his haters, if you will.

332
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And he says these people are preaching the gospel out of envy, out of rivalry, and out of selfish ambition.

333
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Now, scholars agree that what Paul's speaking about here is a group of unbelievers

334
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 that were trying to stir up trouble for Paul before his sentencing takes place.

335
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Remember I told you, and this is why this is important, that the sentencing is going to come.

336
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So here's a group of unbelievers that are wanting Paul to be executed.

337
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And in order to sway the judge, sway the magistrate, what these people are doing is they're spreading the word

338
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 about what Paul was preaching on the streets.

339
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 So they were going into the corridors of power before Paul's sentencing,

340
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 and they're going, "Do you know what this Paul was actually saying on the streets of our city?"

341
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 He was saying this.

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 He was saying that there is a God that's come to earth.

343
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 He was saying that a Jewish carpenter from Nazareth is actually the Messiah.

344
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 This Paul was saying that this person was put to death by us in our regime.

345
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 But three days later he was raised from the dead.

346
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 This Paul is claiming that this raised Jewish rabbi from Nazareth is the Son of God.

347
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 He's saying that we should worship this one rather than Caesar.

348
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 He's claiming that this is King, and that if we follow him all of our lives will be right.

349
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 This is what he's trying to say.

350
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 They think they're trying to stir up trouble.

351
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Paul looks at it and he goes, "Here's the crazy irony.

352
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 They're preaching the gospel.

353
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Even though they have envy and rivalry and selfish ambition,

354
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 even though they're trying to actually sentence me to death,

355
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 the crazy thing is they're actually sharing the gospel.

356
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 So whether out of goodwill or out of this rivalry, the gospel is still being preached."

357
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 It's like Paul is saying this.

358
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 He understands that the power of the gospel is not in the person, it's in the message.

359
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And he's saying as long as that message is going forth,

360
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 then it doesn't matter what actually happens,

361
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 whether to me or even the person who's saying it, the power is in the message itself.

362
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Isn't it ironic that even in my chains my haters are furthering the gospel?

363
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Now we look at Paul this way and we suddenly begin to put him on a pedestal.

364
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Man, Paul was amazing.

365
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I mean, how could this guy have such a radical viewpoint in prison?

366
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 With all the stuff that was happening to him, death coming to him potentially.

367
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 He can still look at the people that hate him and slander him,

368
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 and he can look at them and say these words, but it doesn't matter.

369
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 It doesn't matter what happens to me.

370
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 What matters is what happens to the gospel and the spreading of Jesus.

371
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 We look at Paul like that and we think, "We could never be like that.

372
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 We could never be him. He's so awesome. He's so amazing.

373
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 He never put a foot wrong."

374
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 This guy is like on a pedestal.

375
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 It's like, "Ah, Paul."

376
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Like the Holy Spirit just shines on him all the time.

377
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Do you have that?

378
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I have that view of Paul a lot.

379
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 So have a look at what he says in verse 19 and 20.

380
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Is this helping people still?

381
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 No. Great.

382
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Thank you.

383
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 "For I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

384
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 what has happened to me will turn out for my salvation.

385
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 I eagerly expect and hope that in no way I will be ashamed,

386
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body,

387
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 whether by life or by death."

388
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Notice this. He says to them, "Through your prayers."

389
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Paul humbles himself.

390
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 He subverts worldly leadership.

391
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 He doesn't put himself up as this ego guy who knows everything and is the expert of everything.

392
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 He says, "No, I survive because of your prayers."

393
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Like it's through your prayers that this takes place.

394
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And not just your prayers, but also through the help of the Holy Spirit.

395
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 "I could not do this without your prayers or without the work of the Holy Spirit in me.

396
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 I am dependent on both of those things."

397
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 This is Paul bringing himself down to his people and saying,

398
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 "I'm not perfect. I'm not great. I'm not all these things.

399
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 I realize that actually as your leader amongst you,

400
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 I need your support as much as you think you need mine.

401
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 I need your prayers. Oh, I need the Holy Spirit to help me.

402
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Because if the Holy Spirit is not here, I will suffer."

403
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 And then he says this. I love this.

404
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 He goes, "I really hope that I have sufficient courage to do the work that I've been called to do."

405
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Isn't that beautiful?

406
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 "I really hope I have sufficient courage."

407
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 When was the last time you heard a world leader go,

408
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 "You know, guys, I really hope I have sufficient courage to lead well this country

409
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 because I've got some fear inside of me."

410
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Paul's like, "Man, I'm afraid I might die.

411
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 I'm wrestling with that. That's a reality for me.

412
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 But I hope that through your prayers and the work of the Holy Spirit,

413
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 when the time is right, I will find sufficient courage in me.

414
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 I don't know if I will. There's a fear there,

415
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 and I'm just putting myself vulnerably before you.

416
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But I hope that sufficient courage is there.

417
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Oh, that we would learn to lead openly,

418
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 brokenly before the people that we're leading

419
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 so that as one body we could cheer each other on.

420
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 No arrogance, no ego.

421
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Would you pray for me?

422
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Because you know what? I make mistakes,

423
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 and I really hope that there's sufficient courage in me

424
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 when I'm called to stand up for my faith, for the gospel.

425
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Because I'm not sure if there is.

426
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Can we do that together?

427
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 This is Paul at work for his people.

428
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 So let me pull all the threads of Paul's incredible model of leadership together for us

429
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 in one incredible PowerPoint slide. Are you ready?

430
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 You might want to get your phones out and take a photo of this one,

431
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 because it's good.

432
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Here we go. Let me show you.

433
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Toxic leadership by gospel leadership.

434
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Where we saw that toxic leadership is this,

435
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 that first of all it's ego, vanity, and arrogance.

436
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 What Paul teaches in this passage is that we are to subvert the ego,

437
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 be honest and vulnerable before our people.

438
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Where toxic leadership is a deficiency of self-awareness,

439
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 in this passage Paul shows us an acute self-awareness

440
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 about himself through the work of the Holy Spirit.

441
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Where toxic leadership is achievement at all costs,

442
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 no matter who we run over,

443
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 he talks about sacrificial servant heart for others.

444
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Where toxic leadership is power over competency,

445
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 what we see Paul do in this passage is shift power from human hands to divine agency.

446
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 When toxic leadership is about self-interest over the greater good,

447
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Paul stands and embraces suffering for the greater good.

448
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 I'm willing to go through this in order that you might go forward in the gospel.

449
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Could you imagine a society flourishing under this kind of leadership?

450
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Well you should, because it's called the church.

451
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 The church should be like this, because guess who our leader is?

452
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It's the suffering, sacrificial, servant-hearted, ego-deflating,

453
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 incredibly honest, self-aware, and beautiful leader called Jesus Christ.

454
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And so as we see this and we begin to think about what gospel leadership truly might mean

455
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 for Hong Kong, for the vine, for your place and sphere of influence,

456
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 let me challenge you off the back of this with a couple of ways

457
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 that I think practically you might be able to lead in the week ahead.

458
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Deal with your ego.

459
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Be courageous in your vulnerability.

460
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Put people over profit.

461
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Help people who will not have the ability to help you back.

462
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Look intentionally for ways to subvert your own power

463
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 in order to provide a platform for those that don't have power.

464
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Speak the gospel fearlessly.

465
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Love your haters.

466
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Rejoice in the work of the gospel.

467
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Shine your light away from yourself.

468
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Be willing to actually embrace suffering.

469
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Encourage everyone around you, because you can have rejoicing.

470
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 In the reality of that, it is far greater what God is doing in you and through you

471
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 than what is happening to you.

472
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 That, my friends, is a new way to lead.

473
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Can we stand together? Let me pray for you.

474
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Father, we stand together as a church in this moment now,

475
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 both online, as people are watching this, in their own spheres of influence around the world,

476
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 and here in this room as we all recognise the spheres of influence that are in and upon us.

477
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Father, we come to you as not the experts with gospel leadership,

478
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 but those very much in need of your mercy.

479
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Father, I believe that all of us in this room, when we look at the list of toxic and gospel,

480
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 can find ourselves on both sides of that equation.

481
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 We recognise in our own brokenness that so often we're the ones that actually perpetuate that toxic leadership,

482
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 whether it's in our families, relationships we might have, workplaces that we're embedded into.

483
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And the first thing we do, Lord, is we come graciously to you

484
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 and ask you to forgive us for ways in which we've led in ways that are not your gospel, not your truth.

485
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Father, I want to pray for people in this room that have considerable positions of power and authority.

486
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 I want to pray particularly for people in this room that have considerable leadership, mantle and responsibility.

487
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Father, I pray that you would now come by your Holy Spirit and just gently love on them,

488
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 strengthen their hands for the work that you've called them to do.

489
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Lord, you've raised them into places of considerable authority,

490
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 and yet we all understand the seduction that can come in those places of power.

491
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 So Lord, we pray for those online in this room who carry with them considerable responsibilities.

492
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And we ask, Lord, that you would keep them tethered to your humility, your grace, your love.

493
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Lord, we pray for every single one of us because, as we said earlier,

494
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 we are all leaders for your gospel in our spheres of influence.

495
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Lord, I want to pray for that sufficient courage to lead in a different way than what the world anticipates and expects.

496
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Lord, you called us to be an alternative society, yeast in dough.

497
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And Lord, I pray now by your Spirit that you would empower people in this room to lead courageously, fearlessly for the gospel.

498
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And Father, we take this time in this moment to pray for the leaders over us.

499
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Father, we first of all pray for Carrie Lam.

500
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 We pray for her administration in Hong Kong.

501
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Father, we ask that you would just bless her.

502
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 We ask that your presence would be upon her, that your wisdom would be with her.

503
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 We pray, Lord, that for her and her administration,

504
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 that, Father, your Spirit would be at work in the corridors of their power.

505
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 That, Lord God, you would come by your Spirit and, Lord, open up the ways of the gospel in the administration of our government.

506
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Lord, we pray for those who are of faith in the government,

507
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 that they would see themselves as those that can lead forth your kingdom principles and values for our city in this time.

508
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Would you strengthen the hands of them?

509
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 And we thank you for Carrie and her leadership.

510
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Lord, we pray for Beijing, recognizing the increasing power and authority that that has over us.

511
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 We pray for Xi Jinping and for his leaders.

512
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 We also know that you have placed many Christians in government.

513
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 We pray that they would be strengthened, that you would strengthen their hands for the work that you've called them to do in a very difficult thing.

514
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Lord, we just pray for the leaders over us.

515
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Lord, we ask that we would go forth into our weeks with a gospel-centered heart.

516
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Father, help us to subvert our egos because they're ugly.

517
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Help us, Lord, to be aware of our flaws and be willing to admit them and deal with them.

518
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Help us not to put achievement as number one and in that running over the people that got us to the places that we're at.

519
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Help us, Lord, to subvert our power and to give it away, particularly when we realize that we don't have competency in a particular area.

520
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 Lord, would you help us to always put the greater good and the interest of others beyond ourselves, as Paul is so beautifully modeled to us in this passage.

521
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Lord, would you work in and through us in greater ways than what is happening around us?

522
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 And we pray this in Jesus' name.

523
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 Everyone says, "Amen."

524
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Let's continue to worship together.
