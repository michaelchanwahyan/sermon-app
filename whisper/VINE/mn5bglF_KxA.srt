1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 and we pray in Jesus name amen thank you Susanna.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,400
 Good afternoon how's everybody going?

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,880
 Great nice they've been here through three services so that's encouraging Alison.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,560
 I get the privilege of finishing off this series of encounters with God

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:38,720
 and before we start I just want to share with you that if you came expecting a normal just service

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,520
 then you're going to be disappointed because God responds to the desperate. He responds to the

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,440
 longing of our hearts and so if you're sitting here today and you've come longing for something

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,560
 or desperate for something or just in a place of despair then God will meet you in that place.

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,640
 He promises to. Some weeks ago during worship Emma said that the one thing that all of the

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,480
 encounters we've been looking at during this series had in common was desperation.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,960
 Desperation what is it and how does it connect with encounters with God?

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,720
 Today we're going to look at the story of Hannah so strap yourself in because we're

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,680
 going to be reading some passages of scripture. We're going to start with 1 Samuel 1 1 to 10.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,840
 Now there was a certain man of Ramatham, Zohem of the mountains of Ephraim and his name was Elkanah

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:46,560
 the son of Jerahim the son of Elu, Eluhu the son of Tohu the son of Zuv and Ephraimite and he had

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,520
 two wives the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other was Peninnah. Peninnah had children

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,680
 but Hannah had no children. This man went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,520
 Lord of hosts in Shiloh. Also the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas the priests of the Lord were

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,680
 there and whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering he would give portions to Peninnah

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,760
 his wife and to all his sons and daughters but to Hannah he would give a double portion

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:31,120
 for he loved Hannah although the Lord had closed her womb and her rival also provoked her severely

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,720
 to make her miserable because the Lord had closed her womb. So it was year by year when she went up

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,560
 to the house of the Lord that she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat. Then Elkanah

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,440
 her husband said to her, "Hannah why do you weep? Why do you not eat and why is your heart grieved?

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,640
 Am I not better to you than ten sons?" So Hannah arose after they finished eating and drinking in

26
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,320
 Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the Lord

27
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,440
 and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish.

28
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,880
 The writer makes sure that the very first thing that we learn about Hannah is that she has no

29
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:30,640
 children. Elkanah has two wives Peninnah and Hannah. Peninnah we are told has had children

30
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 but Hannah has none. Now why is this significant? In Hannah's day it was considered so shameful to

31
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,680
 be barren that your husband could divorce you. A barren woman could be treated harshly by the

32
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,120
 community she lived in because children were seen as a blessing and if you couldn't have children

33
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,480
 you're perceived as the opposite of being blessed. 1 Samuel 1 8 and verse 10 captures the essence of

34
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:13,680
 desperation. Hannah why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart grieved? And it goes

35
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,040
 on to say in verse 10, "Hannah was in bitterness of soul and prayed to the Lord and wept in anguish."

36
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 Desperation is a state of extreme distress, extreme anxiety or despair caused by a feeling

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,360
 of complete helplessness or absence of hope. Hannah was desperate, she was in despair. Her

38
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,080
 husband's other wife Peninnah severely and deliberately provokes her to make her miserable.

39
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,440
 The Bible tells us that she has endured this for years. Hannah is suffering from

40
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,280
 "merat nefesh" which means a bitter soul and "ani" which means affliction. Let's take a

41
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,400
 moment to examine the reason why Hannah is experiencing affliction. The Bible says the Lord

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:20,160
 had closed her womb. She is childless because of the Lord. She is suffering because the Lord

43
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,800
 is allowing it. In the Bible all forms of fertility are presented as gifts from God,

44
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,720
 so why was God keeping Hannah childless and allowing her to endure ridicule from the society

45
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,320
 she lived in? Now it's important to understand that God doesn't use infertility as a punishment,

46
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:51,120
 but in Hannah's case he was withholding children from her. Before we explore this further we need

47
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,800
 to understand that Hannah's not the only one in the Bible who suffers affliction or suffers

48
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,400
 from a bitter soul. Naomi, after the death of her sons and her husband,

49
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,440
 renames herself Mara which means bitter. Job speaks in the bitterness of his spirit after

50
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,840
 enduring the loss of his family and all that he owned. And yet all these desperate people have

51
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:24,240
 one thing in common. Their desperation drives them to encounter God and to discover that God

52
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,680
 can work through their afflictions to bring them to a place of greater surrender and fruitfulness.

53
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,240
 Hannah's desperation drove her to encounter God. It could have driven her away,

54
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:47,040
 but instead she pushes in closer. She cries out, "Remember me." She chooses to trust and she pours

55
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:55,840
 out her soul to God. Let's hear her words. 1 Samuel 1 verses 11 to 18. Then Hannah made a vow

56
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,880
 and said, "Oh Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your maidservant and

57
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,920
 remember me and not forget your maidservant and will give your maidservant a male child,

58
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,560
 then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life and no razors shall come upon his head."

59
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,080
 And it happened as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli watched her mouth.

60
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,480
 Now Hannah spoke in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore,

61
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,800
 Eli thought she was drunk. So Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away

62
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,120
 from you." But Hannah answered and said, "No, my Lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I've drunk

63
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,360
 neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the Lord. Do not consider

64
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,600
 your maidservant a wicked woman for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have spoken

65
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,800
 until now." Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace and the God of Israel grant your petition

66
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,640
 which you have asked of him." And she said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your sight."

67
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,800
 So the woman went her way and ate and her face was no longer sad."

68
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,480
 Just want to pause for a minute and take a moment to learn something from this passage.

69
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:28,000
 You know, when people are desperate and grieving and in despair, they are not themselves.

70
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,120
 And it can be easy to misunderstand them. And it can be easy to judge them.

71
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:43,760
 But we see in this passage that Eli comes to a place at the end where instead of judging her

72
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:51,840
 like he did at first, he changes into a place where he becomes a source of blessing to Hannah.

73
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:58,720
 And he speaks peace over her. And when she leaves, her face is no longer sad.

74
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,840
 In our life as we walk, at times we will be desperate and at times though we will be

75
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:14,800
 surrounded by people who are desperate. May we learn from this to be slow to judge, not to judge

76
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,640
 at all, but rather to be people who respond in compassion and be a source of blessing to them.

77
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,440
 Hannah's desperation and barrenness prompted her to make commitments and vows that she would never

78
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:35,440
 have made otherwise. Maybe we need to understand just how desperate our condition is, how fragile

79
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,280
 our lives can be. Because unless we do, we are never going to see our equally desperate need for God.

80
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:50,560
 Desperation is characterized by a sense of urgency or a need for immediate relief.

81
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:59,600
 Desperation has a purpose. Desperation is meant to drive us into the arms of God.

82
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,520
 At the end of 2007, my husband Glenn and my four children, we packed up our lives in Darwin

83
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,920
 and we returned to Queensland in Australia to say our final goodbyes to family and friends.

84
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,720
 We were moving to Hong Kong to continue our work with a Christian NGO in China.

85
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,480
 We were moving in response to God's leading. And everything had been miraculous up to this point.

86
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:35,600
 We had been gifted money out of the blue that had covered all of our expenses and all of our plane

87
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:44,000
 tickets. We arrived in Queensland and our planned month stay before we left for Hong Kong turned

88
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,200
 into another month. And then another month. Something had caused a hold up with our visas

89
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:02,160
 and no one could give us a clear answer to what was going on. We had four kids aged between three

90
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:11,520
 and eleven and we were living like nomads, moving between friends and family, sleeping on mattresses

91
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:19,600
 on the floor out on farms. Me trying to teach our kids, because obviously they, we thought they'd

92
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,080
 only be out of school for a short time, but suddenly it was way longer than what we intended.

93
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,280
 And that one planned month turned into eight long months of waiting.

94
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,800
 I distinctly remember when we reached the eight month mark and it didn't seem to be an end in

95
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,840
 sight. We were at my parents' house and I went into the toilet and I just sat in there. Now,

96
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,520
 those of you with kids will know that that's sometimes the only place you can get some privacy

97
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,800
 and maybe not even then. And I remember feeling so desperate and I remember crying out to God in

98
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:06,880
 anguish. I reminded him that it was him that had brought us this far. It was in response to his

99
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,880
 leading that we were in this place, this land of in-between. Do you know that land where you're

100
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,640
 not where you once were and you're not yet where you're going and you're in this, stuck in this

101
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:29,440
 middle place, this land of in-between. I told God I didn't understand why were we having to wait,

102
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,560
 why were we suffering? I couldn't take it anymore. I found myself surrendering afresh,

103
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:45,120
 my family, my agenda, my future. I told God you have to come through.

104
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,400
 It was that same week that we heard that our visa applications had been approved.

105
00:12:52,400 --> 00:13:01,120
 When we arrived in Hong Kong, I saw our kids who had endured such change in those eight months,

106
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:11,680
 quickly adapt. They quickly adapted to Hong Kong, it felt so easy. I can still remember that first

107
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,680
 night in Hong Kong. Up to that point, one of my children had been waking every single night and

108
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,360
 she was five years old. And I remember that first night in Hong Kong, she slept through.

109
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,680
 And I was like, "What? We're in Australia, you know, we're in a new country, we're in a new house,

110
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,360
 she's in a new bed." And she slept through. It felt like perfect timing in a hundred different ways.

111
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:46,640
 You see, desperation has a season and a purpose. Desperation is meant to lead us to an encounter

112
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:54,640
 with God, a place where we discover hope, a place where we discover peace, a place where we discover

113
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:02,960
 we can depend on God, a place where we can experience greater fruitfulness. Hannah's

114
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:11,040
 desperation drives her to God. She prays to the Lord, she weeps bitterly, she makes a vow saying,

115
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,680
 "Lord Almighty, if you only look on your servant's misery and remember me and not forget me,

116
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:26,160
 but give me a son, I will give him to you all the days of his life." Hannah's desperation drove her

117
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:36,000
 to God. Where does your desperation drive you? Is your desperation causing you to try to figure out

118
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,200
 your life on your own? Is it driving you to places that you were never meant to go?

119
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,840
 Or is your desperation causing you to rely on things you were never meant to place your trust in?

120
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:04,160
 You see, there are people in the Bible like Jonah, whose desperation drove them to dark places.

121
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:13,280
 His desperation drove him into the darkness of the belly of a big fish. Has your desperation driven

122
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:22,640
 you into some dark places? When we choose to let our desperation drive us to God, we encounter him.

123
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:33,600
 Why? Because he hears the cries of the desperate and he responds. He promises. He says, "If you draw

124
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:44,560
 near to me, I will draw near to you." God doesn't break his promises. Psalm 107 reminds us that no

125
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,040
 matter the cause of our desperation, when we cry out to the Lord, he hears us and he delivers us

126
00:15:51,040 --> 00:16:00,160
 from our distress. Psalm 147 verse 3 says, "He heals the brokenhearted and he binds up our wounds."

127
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,960
 Hannah cries out to God. Her desperation causes her to encounter God and experience his faithfulness.

128
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,960
 She regains her hope and her life becomes far more fruitful than she could have ever dreamed.

129
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:25,120
 Let's pick up the story from 1 Samuel 1 verses 19 to 28. "Then they rose early in the morning

130
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,200
 and worshipped before the Lord and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew

131
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,760
 Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her. So it came to pass in the process of time that Hannah

132
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:45,120
 conceived and bore a son and called his name Samuel saying, 'Because I have asked for him from the Lord.'

133
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,160
 Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his

134
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,640
 vow. But Hannah did not go up for she said to her husband, 'Not until the child is weaned, then I

135
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:05,120
 will take him that he may appear for the Lord and remain there forever.' So Elkanah her husband said

136
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,240
 to her, 'Do what seems best to you. Wait until you've weaned him. Only let the Lord establish

137
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,200
 his word.' Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him. Now when she had

138
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,280
 weaned him she took him up with her with three bulls, one ephah of flour and a skin of wine

139
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,800
 and brought him to the place of the Lord in Shiloh and the child was young. Then they slaughtered a

140
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:37,520
 bull and brought the child to Eli and she said, 'Oh my Lord as your soul lives my Lord, I am the woman

141
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,520
 who stood by you here praying to the Lord. For this child I prayed and the Lord has granted me

142
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:51,680
 my petition which I asked of him. Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord. As long as he lives he

143
00:17:51,680 --> 00:18:00,480
 shall be lent to the Lord.' So they worshipped the Lord there. Hannah receives a son. She names him

144
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:09,280
 Samuel, meaning God has heard and God redeems all her affliction and redeems all her suffering by

145
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:18,560
 unveiling his wondrous plan. You see Samuel goes on to serve as a priest and becomes the first prophet

146
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:29,520
 and the last judge of Israel. Samuel's life was pivotal in Israel's history. If Hannah had not

147
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,680
 walked the journey she did, would she have been willing to surrender the one thing she wanted

148
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,760
 more than anything in the world, a child? I don't think so.

149
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,720
 Some of you here today are wrestling with God because he is challenging you to surrender.

150
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:01,280
 Challenging you to surrender something in your life that is very precious to you. It might be

151
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:10,640
 your freedom. It might be a dream for a spouse or a dream for a child. He might be challenging you

152
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:18,560
 about an unhealthy relationship that he wants you to let go of. It might be a job that has become

153
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:26,640
 everything to you, all-consuming. And right now you're sitting here and you know what it's like

154
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:36,080
 to feel afflicted, to feel like you have no peace. Let your desperation drive you to God.

155
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,160
 Drive you to surrender all those things into his hands.

156
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:51,600
 Like Hannah, God's plans for you are better and far surpass your own.

157
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,440
 Continue or choose to trust like Hannah did that his plans for you are to prosper you,

158
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:08,560
 to give you a future and a hope. Hannah surrenders Samuel because she understands the source of all

159
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:17,440
 good things is God. There's a lesson here. We should not hold on tightly to the things God gives us.

160
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:27,840
 Be willing to have open hands and a surrendered heart. Hannah in her surrender discovers

161
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:37,200
 that when we surrender, God pours so much more into our lives. Listen to her prayer after she

162
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:45,440
 surrenders Samuel to the temple. "My heart rejoices in the Lord. In the Lord my horn is lifted high.

163
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,240
 My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. There is no one wholly like

164
00:20:52,240 --> 00:21:01,120
 the Lord. There is no one besides you. There is no rock like our God. Do not keep talking so proudly

165
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,960
 or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.

166
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:17,120
 The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength. Those who

167
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,680
 were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry are hungry no more.

168
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,280
 She who was barren has born seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. The Lord

169
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,600
 brings death and makes alive. He brings down to the grave and raises up. The Lord sends poverty

170
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:45,280
 and wealth. He humbles and he exalts. He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from

171
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:52,800
 the ash heap. He seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. For the foundations

172
00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:00,480
 of the earth are the Lord's, and on them he has set the world. He will guard the feet of his faithful

173
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,680
 servants, but the wicked will be silenced in the place of darkness. It is not by strength that one

174
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,840
 prevails. Those who oppose the Lord will be broken. The most high will thunder from heaven. The Lord

175
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,160
 will judge the ends of the earth. He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his

176
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:28,720
 anointed. Hannah worships God because she gets a glimpse of his sovereignty and how everything in

177
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:37,200
 our lives can be worked together for good when we are willing to live a surrendered life. Hannah

178
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:46,720
 goes on to be blessed with five more children. God never intended her to stay barren, and he never

179
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:55,680
 intended her to stay desperate, and neither does he desire that for you. If you are feeling barren,

180
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:05,600
 if you are feeling empty or closed up or shut up or lifeless or hopeless, helpless, unfruitful,

181
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,480
 desperate, in despair, if you've been praying and longing for something for so long and feel as

182
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:23,200
 though God's forgotten you, know that all of this has a season and a purpose. You were never meant

183
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:31,840
 to stay in this place of desperation. Let it lead you to an encounter with God. Like Hannah, pour

184
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,880
 out your soul and cry out, "Remember me." Would you stand with me today?

185
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:47,920
 Would you close your eyes?

186
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,360
 Hannah's desperation was not of her own making. God had woven it into her story

187
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:12,400
 to bring her to a place of surrender, to draw her into his greater story and purpose.

188
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:20,880
 Some of you here today are like Hannah. You are experiencing desperation, but it is not of your

189
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:28,240
 own making. God has woven it into your story to bring you to a place of surrender.

190
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,760
 But some of you here today, you are experiencing desperation,

191
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,120
 deep dissatisfaction, and it is of your own making.

192
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,760
 Your choices have led you into some dark places, some empty places,

193
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,480
 places that lure you with the promise of so much but leave you hollow and ashamed.

194
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,880
 Let your desperation drive you into the arms of God.

195
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,120
 And some today, you are not desperate enough.

196
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,840
 You're complacent. You're letting life just wash over you.

197
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,480
 The words directionless, meaningless, these are words you know well.

198
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:35,600
 Ephesians 5, 14 says, "Awake, you who sleep. Arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light."

199
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:47,360
 Encounter God today. Surrender and receive his light. Receive his presence.

200
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:55,920
 We're going to create some space, and the worship team is going to lead us.

201
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,920
 We're going to create some space to encounter God, and I want to leave this picture with you.

202
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:07,520
 I was reminded this morning on the bus on the way in of a story found in Ezekiel.

203
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:17,360
 In Ezekiel, he sees water coming out from the doors, under the doors of the temple.

204
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,840
 These rivers of water are the presence of God.

205
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:37,040
 And a man calls Ezekiel to walk into the water, and at first he walks up to his ankles.

206
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,320
 And then the man measures some more and calls him deeper, and he walks up to his knees.

207
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,520
 And then the man calls him deeper, and he's up to his waist.

208
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:59,760
 And then he sees to go deeper will mean that his feet will no longer be on the ground.

209
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:08,720
 He'll be completely at the mercy of God's presence, having surrendered all control.

210
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:17,600
 And my challenge to you today is to locate where you are.

211
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,680
 Are you on the bank, far from the presence of God?

212
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,960
 Or are you up to your ankles?

213
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,040
 We were never meant to stay in the shallows,

214
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,960
 and we were never meant to stay on the bank far from God.

215
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:48,960
 He calls us to come close, to walk bravely and deeply into his presence,

216
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,960
 to surrender all the things we rely on, the things that we think keep us safe,

217
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,320
 the things that we think satisfy us, to let them all go,

218
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,760
 and to become be completely immersed and surrounded by his presence.

219
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:15,200
 So as we worship today, I encourage you, just open your hands,

220
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,200
 be like Hannah, say, "God, remember me."

221
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,520
 Choose to walk into an encounter with God today.

222
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:36,640
 He promises that he will meet you there if you come of your own free choice and cry out to him.

223
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:44,960
