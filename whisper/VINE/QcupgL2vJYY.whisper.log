[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   I'm surrounded by people, this is amazing.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.600]   How's everyone doing?
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.380]   If you're new to the Vine, welcome.
[00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.280]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.960]   We're so, so glad that you are with us today.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.320]   When I was 14 years old,
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.200]   I very, very nearly drowned to death.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's actually a moment in my life
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.760]   that still causes me great trauma
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   when I think of water, even to this day.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.160]   I nearly, nearly drowned to death.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.800]   I was at Waterworld at Ocean Park at the time.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.640]   Now, this is not, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.320]   this is not the new Waterworld
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.280]   that you're all familiar with today.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.240]   The Waterworld where they finally realized
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.080]   that there is such a thing
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.920]   as occupational health and safety.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.680]   This was back in the '80s and '90s, right?
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.160]   The '80s and '90s where, as a 14-year-old kid,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.580]   we would go to Waterworld and that place was rugged.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.660]   I mean, that was down to earth.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.880]   This was the OG of water parks.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.560]   And there was a lot of things
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.920]   that you could get up to in that place
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.160]   where it was pretty dangerous.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.560]   But the ride that was the most favorite
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.920]   for everybody was the Raging River.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.960]   Now, hands up if you ever did the Raging River
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.160]   in the old OG water park.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.040]   Come on!
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.400]   You survived.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.920]   I almost didn't survive.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.020]   Let me tell you the story.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.680]   So the Raging River was this crazy water slide
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.280]   where everybody was given a big, large, inflatable ring.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.680]   And you sat in the ring,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.720]   like you sort of jumped up inside the ring,
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.960]   and you sat in the ring,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.400]   and your bum was kind of in the hole, right?
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.020]   And you sat there nice and comfortable holding onto it.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.860]   And the Raging River was basically a network
[00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.920]   of small little pools and slides, big, large slides,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.660]   that went down the side of this mountain.
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.640]   Now, what you would do is you'd sit
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.680]   in your little kind of inflatable ring,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.880]   and you would slide down a slide,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.680]   and then you would end up in the next pool.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.480]   A few of you would gather in the pool,
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.520]   and then you would slide on down to the next one,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.960]   and so on and so forth until you got to the bottom.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   Now, this slide had an inherent danger to it.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.400]   The inherent danger was what would happen
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.800]   when too many people would gather in one of the pools
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.520]   before going down to the next one,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.660]   and there were people up in the pool above
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.840]   wanting to come down into their pool,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.160]   and the danger would be what would happen
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.200]   if somebody slid down and sort of crashed
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.800]   into everybody that was in the pool below.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.100]   And then that was gonna create a problem.
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.440]   So Waterworld realized they had an inherent danger
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.000]   in their mechanism of the slide,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.400]   so they hired a bunch of young men.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.320]   These guys look like triads.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.960]   There's no other way of saying it.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.400]   A bunch of triads basically were hired,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.760]   and they wore dark sunglasses, and they had walkie-talkies,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.860]   and their job was basically to tell you
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.400]   when you could go down the slides and when you couldn't.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.600]   So their job was to kind of go,
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   okay, there's too many people in the pool right now.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.440]   Everybody up there, stop,
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.680]   and then they would let some people down
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.600]   and make some space and that so forth.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.240]   Now, on this one particular day,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.340]   me and my mates were in the raging river.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.680]   Now, one of the things that we loved to do
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   was to be dangerous.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.800]   And how we were dangerous was we would dare each other.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.480]   Like, whichever pool seems to be the busiest,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.040]   I dare you to slide on down,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.080]   even if the triads tell you not to, right?
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.200]   And this was the whole thing.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.880]   Like, we would dare each other all the time.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.280]   Well, on this one particular day,
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.600]   we're up in one of the pools,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.000]   and we're looking down at the pool below.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.540]   Now, we had never seen the pool so full.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.460]   Maybe 15 kind of inflatable rings
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.680]   would have already have filled the pool,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.280]   but there was probably like 20 or so inflatable rings,
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.720]   people in there already in this pool.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.480]   And it was so full that none of my friends
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.560]   had the courage to give it a go, except me.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.280]   And I looked down on that pool,
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   and I was like, this is my time to shine.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.120]   This is my moment of glory.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.440]   This is my moment to show my friends
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.080]   that I'm the bravest and the strongest
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   and the craziest of them all.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.260]   And so although the sun shades, walkie talkie guys
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.040]   were saying to us, don't go,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.920]   I kind of looked left, I looked right,
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.240]   and I grabbed my ring and I jumped down onto the slide.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.180]   I actually went down like this, head first, like this.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.200]   Have you ever had a moment in your life
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.240]   where you start something, and like the momentum kicks in
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.560]   and you realize you can't back out anymore,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.800]   but you immediately realize that you made a mistake?
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.480]   Have you ever had a moment like that in your life?
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.760]   This was that moment for me.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.320]   As soon as I started on that slide,
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.840]   I realized I have made a big, big mistake.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.200]   The guys that were down below in the pool,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.360]   there was this one man, and he was the one
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.720]   who was closest to the slide, right?
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.480]   And so he's sitting there, and he looks up,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.060]   and there's this crazy guilo kid
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.720]   like barreling down at him head first.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.120]   Now, he does something that I did not expect
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.960]   that he would do.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   Normally what would happen when we did this
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.640]   is we would slide down into the full pool below,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.520]   and they would not know what to do,
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.120]   so we would hit them and fly up over the top of them,
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.800]   and it was kind of funny for us, not for them.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   This guy, I don't know whether that's happened
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.880]   to him before or not, but he sits there.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.640]   He realizes there's this crazy kid coming down the slide,
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.560]   so he does this.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.040]   He leans a little bit, and he lifts up his donut like this,
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.640]   lifts up his ring like this.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.600]   What that means is he suddenly creates
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   a little pool of water where Andrew flies in head first,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.280]   and rather than bouncing up on top of them,
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.000]   which is what I was planning to do,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.680]   I suddenly found myself in the pool under them.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.040]   I looked up, and I had a ceiling of bums above me,
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.520]   bums from everywhere, and they were packed in there
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   so much that I realized immediately
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.280]   there was no way for me to escape.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.320]   I mean, there was no way for me to get up and out
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.200]   to get breath, and immediately I was in a place of panic.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.120]   I literally thought this is how I'm going to die,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.480]   and as I'm there, and I'm beginning to panic,
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.820]   and I'm realizing that there's just no way
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.620]   I'm gonna escape this, I notice the smallest of details,
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.040]   the smallest of details that normally
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.560]   you wouldn't even kind of bother with or even see,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   but I recognize the smallest of details
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.820]   that would actually end up saving my life.
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.980]   Do you know what it is?
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.380]   I remembered I had a knife in me, and I could stab,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.380]   no, that's not what happened, I didn't remember that.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.300]   The smallest detail was this.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.460]   As I looked up at this sea of bums,
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.460]   I saw a very, very small one, a really small bottom,
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.900]   and I realized that this was my chance to escape,
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.740]   that if I could somehow position myself
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.500]   in the water underneath this small little bum,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.060]   I'm assuming that a child was sitting there,
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.180]   I might be able to burst up and push the child out,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.380]   and burst up to the middle of their ring
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.820]   and grasp ahold of the air
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.960]   that I desperately needed for my lungs.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.300]   I'm not proud to admit this,
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.340]   but I got under that small little bum,
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.300]   and I pushed up as hard as I could,
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.660]   and the kid went flying, and Andrew burst up
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.820]   through the inside of the ring, (gasping)
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.100]   grasping for air, and I went from death to resurrection.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.400]   Now, thank you, thank you.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.880]   The kid was fine, by the way,
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.060]   I don't wanna get any emails from anyone later on
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.140]   going like, "Hey, child abuse!"
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.260]   Kid was fine, okay.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.180]   But here's the thing I learned that day.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.340]   I learned a very important lesson.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.460]   I didn't learn the lesson
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.100]   that it's dangerous to play with water,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.100]   although that is a good lesson to learn.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.980]   I didn't learn the lesson that you should listen
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.700]   to people in authority with walkie-talkies,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.460]   although that also is a good lesson to learn.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:45.660]   That day, I learned this, that sometimes in life,
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.060]   the smallest of details has the biggest of impact.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.800]   The thing that you probably would mostly ignore normally,
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.720]   the thing that doesn't maybe seem a big deal to anyone,
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.740]   can actually be the thing that opens up for you
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.660]   the greatest of possibilities.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.400]   Case in point is the Easter story itself,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.140]   as presented by John in his gospel.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.160]   The beautiful thing about Easter that we have as Christians
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.120]   is that we get four different versions
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.440]   of the Easter empty tomb narrative
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.460]   from four different writers.
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.980]   And John, writing a little bit later than the other gospels,
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.120]   captures for us a detail that no one else captures,
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.860]   mentions something that no one else mentions,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.980]   a small little thing that when you're reading the passage,
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.020]   you might actually just kind of pass over it
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.940]   and not look at it much at all,
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.900]   but actually when you sit with it for a moment,
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.380]   opens up the beauty and the wonder
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.020]   of what Easter is really all about.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.420]   And so I wanna read you the story,
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.580]   and I wonder whether as I read it,
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.620]   you might be able to capture
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.620]   what this small little detail is.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.780]   This is John chapter 20, just the first eight verses.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.220]   Early on in the first day of the week,
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.180]   while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.080]   and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.740]   So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple,
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.820]   the one who Jesus loved, and said,
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.180]   "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb,
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.900]   "and we don't know where they have put him."
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.900]   So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.700]   Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.180]   and reached the tomb first.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.580]   I love the fact that he wants that recorded
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.620]   for all the history.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.920]   I won the race.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.060]   He then says this,
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.540]   "Then Peter, who was behind him,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.520]   "arrived and went into the tomb,
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.800]   "and he saw the strips of linen that were lying there,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.820]   "as well as the burial cloth, or the burial shroud,
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.200]   "that had been around Jesus' head.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.440]   "The cloth was folded up by itself,
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.580]   "separate from the other linen.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.120]   "Finally, the other disciple,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.780]   "who had reached the tomb first,
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.380]   "also went inside.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.680]   "He saw and believed."
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.920]   The little detail that John mentions here
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.800]   that none of the other gospel writers mention
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.640]   is this thing.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.740]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.740]   He says, "There was a burial shroud
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.660]   "that had been around Jesus' head,
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.740]   "and the cloth had been folded up by itself
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.220]   "and separated from the other linen."
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.720]   John mentions a burial shroud,
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.560]   which again, kind of is a small little detail,
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.260]   but in this small thing comes such wonderful possibilities.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.440]   A burial shroud was pretty much something like this
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.320]   that I have here on the table.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.540]   It was a cloth that was placed over the face,
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.140]   the head and the face, of the person who had died.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.400]   Now, it was usually a little bit of a thicker cloth
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.020]   than the other linen strips.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.840]   Notice that John mentions linen strips
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.860]   that were also there.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.120]   The linen strips were the ones
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.520]   that wrapped around the body.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.880]   They were very thin kind of linen material.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.960]   The burial shroud was a little bit heavier of material,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.120]   and it was placed over the face
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.680]   or the head of the person who had passed away.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.920]   Now, why was this placed over the face of the person?
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.360]   Well, the burial shroud signified
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.720]   a couple of different things.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.240]   It signified, first of all,
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.840]   that it was kind of like covering up the face
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.080]   as a way of sort of protecting
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.980]   or covering the person's identity
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.520]   so that they would have dignity in death.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.940]   So it was like just kind of covering them
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.000]   in a way of providing some dignity for them.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.640]   The second reason why the burial shroud
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.000]   was placed over the face was because in many cases,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.600]   maybe there was an injury to the face
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.280]   or something had happened to the head.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.040]   In Jesus' case, of course, that was the reality
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.920]   with the crown of thrones that had been on him,
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.560]   and so they cover up the head to protect the head wounds.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.720]   The third thing, but the most important reason
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.680]   why the burial shroud was placed over the face
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.040]   was because it signified the reality
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.900]   that that person had actually died.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.600]   The burial shroud was a sacred cloth
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.980]   that was only used in this instance
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.960]   to basically say this person has passed from life to death.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.920]   A little bit like how perhaps in the modern time
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.320]   and in our modern age, we might take somebody
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.200]   who has passed away and close their eyes,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.760]   just kind of do that little close the eyes thing,
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.720]   saying this person has passed from this life to the next.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.780]   That's what the burial shroud represented.
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:11.100]   So when John says to us that there is this burial shroud,
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.160]   he's wanting to draw attention to the fact
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.460]   that death has occurred.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.360]   Now this is really important
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.120]   because when John's writing his gospel,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.000]   remember it's later than the other gospel writers,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.240]   and by the time John's writing his gospel,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.920]   the people, the Jewish people of the day
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.380]   are basically saying, we don't think Jesus ever died.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.220]   Maybe he was on the cross and maybe he sweated that blood
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.380]   and maybe all that happened, yeah,
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.560]   but maybe he didn't actually die on the cross
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.000]   and so when he got put into the tomb,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.720]   he was actually still alive.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.040]   And that's the reason why he was able to get up and escape.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.680]   Or other rumors that were spreading at the time was this,
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.220]   oh, maybe he faked his death.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.080]   Yeah, the disciples, they faked the whole thing.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.060]   It wasn't really true, it wasn't real,
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.200]   no one really saw it, no, he escaped and ran off.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.280]   And John says, no, you need to understand
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.320]   that there is a burial shroud
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.960]   that was around this man's face
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.480]   and no one placed a burial shroud on anyone
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.040]   unless they had confirmed that they were really dead.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.780]   So for John, this is a big deal.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.760]   It might seem like a small detail to us,
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.580]   but it's a much bigger impact than what we might realize.
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.800]   This is saying, no, Jesus was dead
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.180]   and it was important for John and his audience
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.740]   to understand that that had taken place.
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.140]   But then he mentioned something else.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.760]   He doesn't say that the burial shroud was there.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.520]   He said it had been taken up,
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.300]   that it had been folded up,
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.820]   and it had been placed separately
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.420]   from the other strips of linen.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.980]   Again, another small detail we might easily pass over
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.560]   when we've read this a million times,
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.480]   but John is trying to communicate something
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.020]   that's gonna help the people connect
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.140]   to something that was significant on the Easter story,
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:56.900]   folded up and separated from what they think else.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.480]   And the question John wants you to ask
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   as you're reading his narrative is, why did that happen?
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.260]   Well, to understand that, I wanna unpack for you
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.320]   actually a bigger story,
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.160]   not just a story of the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.360]   but a story that goes way back
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.440]   to the beginning of all things.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:20.220]   700 years before the empty tomb experience that John has,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.120]   something happens for Israel, the nation.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.560]   At that moment in history, Babylon,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.880]   which was the largest empire of that time,
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.540]   who lived on the east side
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.020]   of where Israel's land was at the time,
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.920]   came in and actually attacked the Jewish people.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.760]   They stormed into Jerusalem,
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.080]   they destroyed the temple that was on Mount Zion,
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.440]   they killed many of the Jewish people at that time,
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.520]   and they took a remnant of the people
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.360]   out into captivity and exile in Babylon itself.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.640]   And the Bible tells us that for 70 years,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.200]   the Jewish people were in exile in Babylon.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.920]   And this was the darkest time for Israel
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.080]   in maybe all of their history.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.200]   This was a time where they were wrestling
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.080]   with the realities of so many things
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.620]   that were going through their mind.
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:06.480]   They were wrestling with,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.760]   why has God allowed this to happen?
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.120]   Why has God come and done this?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.960]   What has taken place?
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.640]   And now that the temple is destroyed,
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.200]   where is God's presence on earth?
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.760]   'Cause that's where they believe God's presence dwelt,
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.240]   and the Babylonians had come in and destroyed the temple,
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.640]   and suddenly they were asking these questions,
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.400]   where is God then?
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.120]   'Cause if God doesn't reside in his temple,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.760]   where now is our Lord?
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.120]   And they're in exile in Babylon,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.060]   and so much of the writing at this time
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.480]   is them crying out and saying,
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.080]   why have you forsaken us, God?
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.320]   Why have you left us?
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.720]   Why have you parted from us?
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.960]   And as they're beginning to think this,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.700]   they also have this other revelation.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.160]   They realize that the reason why they're in exile
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   in the first place is because of their sin,
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.880]   their brokenness.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.520]   Because they had acted and done,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.080]   and had treated their God in ways
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.200]   that they should not have done.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.780]   And this has placed them in a place
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.860]   where they now are in exile,
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.220]   and they realize that this is largely
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.880]   because of the brokenness found within them.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.460]   Which opens up for us another big story,
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.720]   the story of humanity's brokenness itself.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.200]   The Bible explains that story by linking it
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.080]   to the first humans, Adam and Eve,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.440]   created by God to be in relationship with Him,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.840]   relationship with themselves,
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.280]   relationship with one another,
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.040]   relationship with His creation.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.920]   Genesis 1 and 2 pitches us this beautiful picture
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.120]   of what Shalom looks like
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.880]   between God and humanity perfect together.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.240]   And God tells Adam and Eve just one thing not to do,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.680]   just like a little 14-year-old boy,
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.520]   the one thing you're not supposed to do
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.120]   is go down that slide into the next pool.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.580]   The one thing He told them not to do,
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.400]   take of the fruit of the knowledge of the tree,
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.340]   and good and evil.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.120]   Well, we all know the human story, don't we?
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.840]   Us humans, if you tell us not to do something,
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.640]   it's the first thing we're gonna do.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.120]   Adam and Eve take the fruit that they should not have done.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.680]   The Bible tells us that this story
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.720]   of humanity's brokenness begins at that point.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.960]   And the Bible's very clear that that brokenness happens
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.400]   in basically those four essential relationships,
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.840]   our relationship with God,
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.480]   our relationship with ourselves,
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.680]   our relationship with the others around us,
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.160]   and even our relationship with creation.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.180]   And there's a brokenness and a heaviness
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.560]   that's now come into all spheres of that area in our lives.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.640]   And the Bible says from Genesis 4 onwards,
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.360]   it's the story of humanity
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.240]   wrestling with the heaviness of the sin,
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.760]   knowing what it is to breaking that relationship
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.760]   with God, themselves, with others in the world,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.880]   and the heaviness that comes on them in that reality.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.300]   And the rest of the biblical narrative's a fascinating story
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.140]   because it's a story of God's people
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.560]   wanting to be back in relationship with Him,
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.460]   and yet realizing that their own efforts
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.380]   and their own ability to do that will never be enough.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.980]   They realize that they're the ones
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.980]   that broke that relationship, but they can't restore it.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.980]   That's only gonna be God.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.180]   God's gonna have to do something
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.900]   to help restore that relationship
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.660]   because it's way beyond their ability.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.820]   And this brings us back to that moment 700 years
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.580]   before the tomb was empty,
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.100]   where Israel's in captivity in Babylon,
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.780]   and it's there for the first time they go,
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.000]   we need God to do something new.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.140]   We need Him to step in.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.060]   We can't try to create this in our own strength anymore.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.200]   We are useless.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.500]   No, God has to come in His compassion and His love
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.120]   and change it all.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.700]   So it shouldn't surprise us that in this moment,
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.820]   700 years before Jesus' empty tomb,
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.660]   God begins to speak through prophets,
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.100]   and He tells these prophets a vision
[00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.740]   and a dream of what's gonna happen.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.580]   And each prophet has a different perspective
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.100]   and a different, broader and wider dream.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.520]   And in this moment, God calls one prophet.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.300]   In this incredible, dark time of Israel's history,
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.500]   one prophet named Isaiah.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.900]   And Isaiah begins to get this amazing vision
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.420]   of what the world might be like when God comes
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.180]   and steps in and changes everything.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.240]   And I wanna read to you the vision he gets
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.000]   right at this time of exile for the Jewish people.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.580]   It's found in Isaiah.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.820]   It starts in chapter 25,
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.060]   and I wonder if you can hear this as I speak it.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.860]   He says, verse seven, Isaiah 25.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.900]   "On this mountain, He will destroy the burial shroud
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.780]   "that enfolds all the people,
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.620]   "the sheet that covers all nations.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.860]   "He will swallow up death forever,
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.540]   "and the sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.660]   "from all faces.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.040]   "He will remove the distance from people
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.140]   "from all the earth,
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.140]   "for the Lord has spoken.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.180]   "In that day, they will say,
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.940]   "'Surely this is our God.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.320]   "'We trust it in Him, and He saved us.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.800]   "'This is the Lord.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.100]   "'We trust it in Him,
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.180]   "'and we rejoice and be glad in His salvation.'"
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.620]   Can you hear what Isaiah says
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.460]   700 years before the resurrection of Jesus?
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:06.220]   God gives him a picture of what sin for humanity is like.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.740]   And here's how Isaiah describes it.
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.660]   He's like, "It's like a burial shroud
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.580]   "has been placed over us,
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.720]   "like a sheet has come and been placed
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.100]   "over all of humanity."
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.340]   And in this prophetic vision,
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.960]   he sees humanity shrouded in death, essentially,
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.980]   with that burial shroud over their faces,
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.100]   over their heads,
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.580]   covering them like you would someone who's died.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.640]   And it's Isaiah's beautiful prophetic way of saying,
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.460]   "Don't you realize that this is what sin does to us?"
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.820]   The Bible in the New Testament would say it elsewhere.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.860]   It would say that the wages of sin is what?
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.460]   Is death.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.820]   And so the burial shroud,
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.620]   which had always signified the passing of something,
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.580]   Isaiah sees it over all of humanity,
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.780]   like that heavy cloth placed upon us,
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.200]   which makes it hard for us to see anything.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.520]   We can kind of make out vague shapes,
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.820]   but not really see as we were supposed to see,
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.420]   the weight of it over our heads, pulling down upon us,
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.660]   this beautiful poetic imagery is what Isaiah is saying,
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.440]   "Humanity's sin and brokenness is like."
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.740]   So stick with us for a moment,
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.020]   'cause I think that's something
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.780]   that we can all resonate with, right?
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.220]   I think in many ways,
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.860]   no matter what kind of life you may have led,
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.680]   we can all recognize the heaviness
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.080]   that life creates for us at times,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.820]   the brokenness that is so present for us.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.060]   And perhaps for some of you, as you've come in today,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.980]   this resonates with you.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.980]   You know what it's like to wear a bit of a shroud
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.040]   over your head, if you will.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.460]   You know the heaviness of life,
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.760]   the hardship and the challenges.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.700]   Perhaps for some of you,
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.340]   it's because of what others have done to you.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.060]   Perhaps you've been hurt.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.460]   Perhaps somebody else's brokenness has broken you.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.340]   Perhaps words have been shared, things have happened.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.860]   Maybe someone's done something to you
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.460]   that's caused a lot of trauma and hardship in your life,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.180]   and it feels like there's a filter now over your life.
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.100]   Or perhaps for some of us, we resonate with it
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.000]   because we know of our own actions.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.060]   We know that we've hurt others.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.940]   We know that despite the fact that we didn't want to,
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.040]   words came out of our mouths, or actions happened,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.420]   or things took place,
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.720]   and we know we've broken others because of it.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   I think we all resonate, don't we,
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.860]   with the reality that the shroud can cover us,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.140]   that the heaviness of the cloth can be around us,
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.060]   that the weight of it can push down upon us.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.900]   We can all wrestle with that.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.940]   I think we can all connect with it.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.820]   And this is why Isaiah is sharing it,
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:44.660]   because he's like,
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.940]   "This image kind of fits for all of us, doesn't it?"
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.860]   But then he says this beautiful thing.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.980]   He says, "I see a time in the future
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.460]   "when God will act, and the burial shroud,
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.880]   "the sheet that covers all peoples and nations,
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.700]   "will be destroyed.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.740]   "It will be removed."
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.180]   The word destroyed there, guess what it means?
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.460]   Actually, if you look at it in the Hebrew
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.860]   and you break it down, it means to be set aside.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.300]   He says, "There's a time coming in the future
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.340]   "where the burial shroud will be set aside,
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.620]   "where it will be destroyed once and for all."
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.940]   And he says this is gonna happen
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.540]   for all peoples and all nations.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.380]   I love that.
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.660]   You see, Isaiah could have just played to the crowd.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.500]   He could have just said,
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.020]   "Hey, this is gonna happen for us Jewish people.
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.540]   "This is good news for all of us Jewish people."
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.820]   But he doesn't say that.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.420]   He says, "This is for all people.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.060]   "For all nations."
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.820]   Like no matter what other cultural background,
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.140]   no matter who you are, if you're a human being,
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.980]   this is good news for you, Isaiah is saying.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.780]   He's saying God has taken the burial shroud,
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.700]   that heaviness that weighs upon you,
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.860]   and he's removed it and he's placed it away,
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.500]   and you can have fresh life, all peoples on earth.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.560]   You see, the liberation of God is not a half liberation.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.520]   You know, a liberation just reserved
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.020]   for the special few of us.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.740]   It's a liberation for all people and all nations.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.020]   The sheet has been removed.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.620]   Anyone who trusts in him, it is gone.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.020]   That is the powerful message of Easter.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.500]   That's the wonder and the beauty
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.300]   of what we sit in this room today
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.020]   to praise and to be thankful for.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.980]   Not something that happened some 700,000, 2,000,
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.140]   2,500 years ago for other people,
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.860]   but something that's happened for all of us
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.860]   right here and right now.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.300]   This is why Isaiah fills this with beautiful imagery
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.580]   in terms of the liberation that comes for us all.
[00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.480]   Notice what he says.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.740]   He says, "The sovereign Lord will wipe away every tear.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.740]   "He will remove the disgrace from his people.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.700]   "He will save us."
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.020]   Oh, what beautiful thoughts.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.780]   He's gonna wipe everything away.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.220]   He's gonna liberate the shame and the disgrace
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.100]   that sits on us because of the things that we've done
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.380]   that we're not proud of, and he's going to save us,
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.060]   bring us that salvation.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.740]   It's a call to the wonder of a God
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.060]   who can change everything.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.980]   So stick with us all and come back to me
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.800]   and come back with me to John chapter 20.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.660]   Notice what John says.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.620]   He says, "When I walked in there,
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.160]   "when I arrived in the tomb,
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.260]   "I saw the strips of linen lying there
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.280]   "as well as the burial shroud
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.580]   "that had been around Jesus' head,
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:25.160]   "and the cloth now was folded up by itself
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.720]   "and separated from the other linen."
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.720]   John is giving us a very small detail
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.300]   that has a massive impact.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.400]   He's saying that that shroud that was around Jesus' head
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.980]   has been folded up and set aside,
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.080]   not just 'cause it says something about Jesus,
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.140]   because it says something about the biblical story
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:42.980]   of all time.
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.300]   It actually links to what Isaiah had prophesied
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.940]   700 years before that God's people had been longing
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.660]   for the day when God would step in
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.380]   and deal with sin once and for all,
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.660]   that the burial shroud that was around us all
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.700]   would be lifted off and separated and destroyed
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.620]   so we would know the fullness of love,
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.660]   the fullness of forgiveness, the fullness of life.
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.320]   And he says, "I saw it and I believed."
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.980]   He said, "I made the connection
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.120]   "between Isaiah's prophetic vision
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.680]   "and God's work in Jesus,
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.780]   "and I no longer saw Jesus as just a good moral leader.
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.420]   "I no longer saw him as just some prophet of old.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.380]   "I now see him as the Son of God."
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.500]   The burial shroud has been set aside.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.160]   I love the word he uses here in the Greek.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.140]   It's the word folded.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.300]   He said, "It's folded," which interestingly is the same
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.260]   if you read the Old Testament in the LXX,
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.280]   which is the Greek version of the Old Testament,
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.700]   the word that Isaiah uses to speak of the unfolding
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.540]   of the shroud around all people.
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.140]   It's the same root word.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.220]   So here's John making this beautiful theological connection
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.680]   to the language he's using.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.780]   What was once enfolded over all of humanity
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.660]   has now been folded and separated and set apart.
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:56.500]   Destroyed.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.460]   And where the Bible says that the wages of sin is death,
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:06.140]   Easter tells us that death is not the final story.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.320]   That death is not how this thing's all going to end up.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.960]   That actually, here's what's gonna happen.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.500]   Every tear is gonna be wiped away.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.900]   All that shame is gonna be removed.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.340]   The salvation will come for anyone
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.060]   who would put his trust in him.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.020]   The beauty of Easter is the celebration
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.300]   of a new time has embarked in this world.
[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.420]   A new time has come.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.740]   This is why Jesus, when he's on the cross, cries out,
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.880]   it is finished.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.140]   That old story is done.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.380]   The shroud has been lifted.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.540]   Death is not a definition of humanity anymore.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.300]   Yes, we will all die at some point,
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.780]   but death is not the full stop.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.660]   It's merely a comma because Jesus rose again.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.660]   And you're gonna rise again.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.580]   And you're gonna be filled with new life
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.340]   and have eternal hope and salvation and joy
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.660]   in the presence of God.
[00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:56.740]   John enters the tomb and believes
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.720]   because he sees the shroud has been destroyed.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.700]   It's a beautiful, powerful, poignant picture
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.940]   of what can take place through the resurrection power
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.880]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.480]   And I love this because it welcomes us into a thought.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.160]   A thought that this kind of freedom and liberation
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.020]   is not reserved for just those
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.620]   that have done something special throughout all of history,
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:28.500]   but it's actually something available for all.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.880]   Our baptism candidates in just a little bit
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.080]   at 4.30 this afternoon, that's what they're celebrating.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.200]   They're celebrating that their burial shroud
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.800]   has been removed.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.220]   And they're going down publicly
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.280]   into the waters of Repulse Bay,
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.480]   the beautiful, dirty waters of Repulse Bay.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.020]   And they're gonna be washed clean
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.060]   by the waters of the Spirit of God, amen?
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.780]   And it's not just our baptism candidates
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.140]   that are celebrating this.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.920]   Millions of Christians around the world
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.080]   are celebrating this on this very day,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.280]   that their own burial shroud has been removed
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.340]   because of what Jesus has done on that cross.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.260]   And I want you to know this,
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.860]   that that's also what has happened for you too,
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.260]   whether you've ever realized it or not.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.660]   Perhaps for some of you here, this is a new story.
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.580]   It's a new idea, but you resonate and connect with it
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.900]   because you felt that heaviness
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.740]   and you know what that burden of life can feel like.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:22.580]   And maybe this is the first time you're ever hearing
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.740]   that something has taken place
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.740]   that has removed that heaviness and that burden from you.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.660]   Jesus put it this way in the gospels.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.780]   He said, "Anybody who's weary and tired,
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.080]   who's overburdened, who's worn down,
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.300]   you can come to me and I will give you rest."
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.100]   And he says, "My yoke is light, my burden easy."
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.060]   In other words, the heaviness of that shroud
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.660]   has been lifted, it has been removed,
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.160]   and therefore there's a new story for you.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.060]   What is that new story?
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.660]   Well, interestingly, if you actually go back
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.020]   into the Isaiah passage,
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.880]   you'll see something quite beautiful.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.660]   See, Isaiah doesn't just speak of this moment
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.180]   where the burial shroud was lifted.
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.460]   In the very same passage, he speaks about something else.
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.820]   Let me read this to you in verse six.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.780]   He says, "On this mountain, the Lord Almighty
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.820]   will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples,
[00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.300]   a banquet of aged wine, the best of meats,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.320]   and the finest of wines for all the people."
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.620]   You see, the imagery that the Bible uses
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.580]   to talk about the fact that the burial shroud
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.700]   has been lifted is a table filled with harvest,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.860]   a place of abundance that anyone can come to
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.780]   and partake in a meal that will give them life.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.980]   Isaiah, having seen the burial shroud getting lifted
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.300]   some 700 years before the work of Jesus on the cross,
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.100]   then sees a picture of a banqueting table
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.460]   filled with the finest of food and the greatest of wine.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.820]   And he says, "Isn't it amazing that the end of our story
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.000]   is not the burial shroud, but a table filled with abundance,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.760]   that we get invited into a greater narrative
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.500]   than the one that we thought our humanity
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.780]   had invited us into?
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.460]   The table has been set."
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:13.420]   And this imagery of a table that's filled with abundance
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.920]   and fruitfulness and wonder and looks really good to eat,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.940]   that story becomes the central narrative
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.840]   that the Bible uses to talk about the work
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.020]   of salvation in Christ.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.260]   Jesus himself, at the beginning of the gospel,
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.260]   in his announcement of himself as more than just a prophet,
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:39.060]   he starts his ministry at a wedding in Cana,
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.700]   and a wedding banquet is there, and they run out of wine,
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.220]   and Jesus says, "Bring me, just bring me the ceremonial pots
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.420]   that are filled with water."
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.820]   And he's like, "I will show you that the greatest
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.540]   of all wine will be poured out for anyone to enjoy."
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.460]   And this beautiful picture of what this wine is like
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:00.140]   is really Jesus already before he sheds his blood
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.220]   on the cross saying, "This is what it's gonna be like.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.580]   We're all gonna gather around an incredible table,
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.400]   and we're gonna feast for all eternity,"
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.460]   because this is the picture of what God is.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.420]   God is not an angry despot who's filled with wrath
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.380]   and wanting to punish everybody.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.180]   No, God is an abundant, glorious, loving, faithful father
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.540]   who sets the table for any prodigal son and daughter
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.880]   to come and partake with him.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.180]   The burial shroud has been destroyed.
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.020]   Let me put it this way.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.340]   The burial shroud has become a tablecloth,
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:36.940]   and that tablecloth now is a welcome to anyone
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.060]   who would put their trust in him.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.440]   In fact, at the end of the biblical narrative,
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.660]   right at the end of the story,
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.060]   this is how the Bible finishes.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.260]   Let me read this to you from Revelation 19.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.980]   I love how this puts it.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.040]   "Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude,
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.620]   like the roar of rushing waters
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.820]   and like the loud pearls of thunder, shouting,
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.940]   'Hallelujah, for our Lord God Almighty reigns!
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.620]   Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory,
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.060]   for the wedding banquet of the Lamb has come,
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.460]   and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.740]   Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear."
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.580]   I love this.
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:13.200]   Revelation pitches the endable things,
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.980]   and they picture this wedding banquet of the Lamb,
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.320]   and it's saying that there's a great multitude of people
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.860]   who are welcome to this.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.160]   And notice what it says.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.700]   It says, "The burial shroud,"
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.540]   basically it doesn't say this,
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.140]   but the burial shroud has been set aside,
[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.000]   "and new linen has been given."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.800]   Because the bride is the church.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.360]   The bride is those that have put their trust in Jesus Christ,
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:37.320]   and we're now wrapped up in fresh, bright, clean linen.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.660]   Burial shroud destroyed.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.160]   New linen, and a banquet given.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:49.400]   So for you, the smallest of details
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.820]   can actually create the biggest of impact.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.980]   A burial shroud set aside that actually draws us
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.240]   into the wonder of what this whole celebration is all about,
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.760]   and a table set in abundance for you.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.640]   Let me challenge you here if you're a Christian.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.160]   If you're a Christian,
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.980]   this whole thing is a challenge, I think.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.440]   Because I think it's easy sometimes for us Christians
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.260]   in our relationship with Jesus
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.300]   to have those ups and downs that we have with Him,
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.540]   and sometimes think that He's the God of the no,
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.720]   that He's a God that holds back,
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.500]   that He's not coming through with the things
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.460]   that we want Him to come through for.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.520]   And we might have a picture of the table
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   that He sets before us, and it's barren.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.000]   And if you feel a little bit like that as a Christian,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.500]   that your relationship with Jesus
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   is a little barren right now,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.300]   that maybe because of some disappointments,
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.980]   or because you thought something would happen,
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.580]   or He would do something and it didn't feel like He did it,
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.540]   when you look at the table,
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.660]   you don't see a lot on that table at all.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.900]   You look at a table of lack.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.180]   I think the challenge of Easter is to tell you
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.540]   that actually it's a table of abundance.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.380]   And perhaps for some of you
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.840]   who have been Christians for a long time,
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.760]   this is a challenge to you.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.780]   Can you see your picture with the Lord?
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.780]   Can you see the table like this for you?
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.660]   If you're not a Christian here, we're so glad you're here.
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.460]   And I hope that maybe something that I've shared
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.420]   this afternoon or this morning has really challenged you,
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:14.900]   or maybe just opened yourself up
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.740]   to thinking about life slightly differently.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.820]   And this invitation maybe has resonated with some of you.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.940]   Maybe like me, you know what it is
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.740]   to feel the heaviness of life and the burden of things.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.540]   Maybe that brokenness has been there for you,
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.460]   and maybe it's even resonating for you in this moment.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.060]   And the wonder of Easter is that
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.460]   that burial shroud has been removed,
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.620]   and that just simply through trust in Jesus.
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.340]   Remember John standing on the outside of the tomb,
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.340]   and he knows, man, if I go inside there,
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.740]   and if I see the thing that I think I'm gonna see,
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.060]   then I'm gonna have to believe.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.180]   Perhaps for some of you in this room,
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.580]   you're feeling it in your spirit right now.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.620]   You're feeling your heart beating.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.220]   You know that this might be the moment
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.580]   where you've come to a place
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.260]   where you're willing to put your trust in Him,
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.360]   your life in His hands.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.200]   I'm not gonna promise you
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.520]   that life is suddenly gonna be easy.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.980]   It's gonna be rainbows and butterflies.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.620]   No.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.500]   Sometimes when we give our lives to Jesus,
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.940]   things get challenged even more.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.300]   Jesus described walking with Him like a narrow path,
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.300]   not a big, broad one.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.900]   But He says it's a narrow path that leads to life,
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.260]   eternal life, the hope of forgiveness
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.860]   and the glory of restoration.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.300]   And so I wanna pray for you.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.620]   I wanna pray that perhaps
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.420]   that might be your journey here today.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.740]   So I wonder whether we would all just bow our heads
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.380]   as we come into a time of prayer.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.820]   Father, I'm so grateful for each person
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.660]   that's here in this room,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.620]   that those that are watching online,
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.140]   those in our overflow.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.580]   Lord, I'm grateful that we get
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.580]   to come around the table today together.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.540]   And Lord, first of all,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.780]   we thank you that the burial shroud has been removed.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.580]   We thank you, Lord, that it's been set aside.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.420]   It's destroyed.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.180]   And Lord, we thank you that in the fact
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.420]   that you did that in the death and resurrection of Jesus
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.860]   now provides for us a open tomb
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.300]   that asks us whether we will enter and believe.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.100]   Father, for the Christians here
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.860]   where perhaps they feel like their table is not abundant,
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.900]   perhaps they struggle to see the overflow
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.460]   of what's on this table in this moment
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.140]   in their relationship with you.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.340]   I wanna pray that this Easter
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.980]   would be a breakthrough for them.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.740]   I wanna pray that you would, Lord,
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.220]   bring them back to the abundance of your love
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.260]   and your heart and your grace.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.740]   Lord, I wanna pray for breakthrough
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.100]   for those Christians here
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.820]   who need to see the table more full.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.020]   And I pray that they would see
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.500]   that you have done everything
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.620]   and you've wrapped them in white, fresh linens.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.420]   And I pray that they would find great joy
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.380]   in their relationship with you again here on Easter Sunday.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.820]   And Father, I pray for anyone here
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.780]   who perhaps when they came in today
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.740]   would say that they weren't a Christian.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.380]   And if that's you, I just wanna invite you
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.500]   just to this moment of just reflection.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:05.740]   Lord, God loves you so much.
[00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.100]   No matter how hard things have been,
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.780]   no matter how difficult life is,
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.340]   he's here for you in this moment.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:18.820]   And his invitation is the same as it was for John
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.140]   some 2,000 years ago.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.300]   He's welcoming you in to believe.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.300]   And he's saying, will you come in and believe today?
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.220]   And I know that for some of you in this room
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.340]   and watching online right now,
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.860]   this is gonna be a life-changing moment for you.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.820]   As you come to just put your trust in him,
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.300]   the Bible says that we come into relationship with God
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.940]   as we repent and believe.
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.700]   The word repent just literally means
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.260]   to ask for God to cover us in his love,
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.740]   to recognize that we've hurt people
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.180]   and hurt ourselves at times,
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.100]   to even recognize that we've hurt him
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.620]   and to ask for forgiveness.
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.580]   And then out of that place of just recognizing
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.300]   the forgiveness that we have in a loving, merciful Lord,
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.780]   we then have the celebration and the joy
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.420]   of knowing that eternal life is before us.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.660]   And so I wanna pray for any of you here today
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.020]   where that might be your journey.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.340]   And what we wanna do is in a moment,
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.540]   we're gonna pray a prayer all together.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.380]   And if you're praying that prayer for the first time,
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.020]   we want to invite you to come up
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.500]   and connect with us after the service,
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.820]   myself or other team members.
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.300]   We'd love to just talk with you about next steps
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.220]   and what living a life with Jesus is.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:33.020]   You know, a life with Jesus is not just a decision
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.500]   you make in a service, that's the starting point.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.020]   But it's actually a discipleship journey
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.540]   of great abundance and love and joy.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.540]   And we wanna come around you and help you with that.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.060]   So as we're all just heads bowed, eyes closed,
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.580]   I want us to all to pray this prayer.
[00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.700]   And if you wanna invite Jesus into your life
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.300]   for the very first time,
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.460]   then this is the prayer that you're praying to do so.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.100]   But we're all gonna pray it as an encouragement together
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.340]   as the body of Christ.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.380]   So let's pray this prayer.
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.940]   Pray after me, Lord Jesus,
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:05.860]   I wanna thank you for dying for me and for raising again.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.580]   I thank you that the tomb was empty.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:15.780]   And Lord, we thank you that the burial shroud
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:21.300]   that has been over me has been set aside.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.780]   Set aside because of Jesus.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:31.540]   Father, I ask that you would forgive me in this moment.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.980]   Forgive me for the ways that I've hurt you,
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:42.380]   that I've hurt myself and that I've hurt others around me.
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.140]   And I thank you that you forgive me.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.900]   And in this moment, I pray you would give me now
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:56.540]   your spirit, your Holy Spirit,
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:02.980]   filled with love, grace, strength for life ahead.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:08.980]   And I thank you that I now have eternal life in you.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:16.020]   Help me to walk every day in the humility of your service.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.820]   Your service.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.420]   And I pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.620]   Can we put our hands together for anyone
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.420]   that may have prayed that prayer for the very first time?
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.740]   (congregation applauding)
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.940]   The beautiful thing.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.340]   Would you stand with me?
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.820]   And we're gonna finish our time together
[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.100]   with just one more response in worship
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:37.460]   as we celebrate the beauty and the wonder
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.300]   of what the Lord has done amongst us.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.900]   (gentle music)
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.500]   (gentle music)
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:54.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
