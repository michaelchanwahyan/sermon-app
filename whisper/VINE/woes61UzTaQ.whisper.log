[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   As I was listening to that testimony, I was like, "Wow, he's just preached my whole word.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.560]   We can go home."
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.560]   No, we won't.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.720]   It's such a privilege and an honor to have been on the board of directors for Branches
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.680]   of Hope for the last three and a half years.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   And today, being given the privilege to talk about something I'm passionate about, the
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.360]   work we do at Branches of Hope, and something I'm really passionate about, the work of compassion,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.880]   such a privilege.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.000]   My husband is here, day 11, and his name is KK.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.440]   I think Andrew spoke about it.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.080]   So if you hear him screaming, "Amen," he's just here to encourage me.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.080]   Amen.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.680]   So, yeah, I need all that encouragement.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   Thank you, everyone.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.240]   So we're going to read from Matthew 22, 37 to 40.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.320]   So turn with me to Matthew 22, 37 to 40.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.760]   And Jesus replied, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.000]   and all your mind.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.720]   This is the first and greatest commandment.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.200]   A second is equally important.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.440]   Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   So if you look at your neighbor, you're meant to love them, even if they're not your spouse.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.560]   So love your neighbor as you love yourself.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.680]   The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.480]   That means this is a very important piece of scripture that we're looking at today.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.200]   Today is Branches of Hope Sunday, and it's no surprise that we're going to be speaking
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   about love.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.000]   Because, like mentioned before in the testimony, the people we are serving in Branches of Hope
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.360]   have experienced the very opposite of what we're talking about, this love.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.040]   They have experienced a brutality, most of them, that we can't even think or imagine.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.920]   What is worse is that they are far away from the loving families that could be helping
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.040]   them heal from the traumas that they've experienced.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.160]   But I believe this community, you and I, God has placed us in this community to be that
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:10.080]   love, to be that church of hope that wraps its arms around those who are in need.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200]   This reminds me of a dream I had a few weeks ago.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.560]   And in this dream, I was shown a scripture but without the words.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.000]   So I knew this was a scripture, and I sensed God was saying in the scripture, "The first
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.920]   part you're doing really well, but the second part you're not doing well."
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.880]   So the whole day, and this never came up, you know, Matthew 22.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.080]   So the whole day I was thinking and agonizing, and I came to worship.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.800]   Usually God speaks to me in worship.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.360]   So I came to worship, I was agonizing, "God, you've got to tell me, because if you don't
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.760]   tell me, then I can't repent."
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   Nothing.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.060]   Then after that, the whole day I was really like, "God, you need to tell me," you know.
[00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.160]   And just before I went into a prayer meeting with some ladies, God began to reveal it.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.840]   I think the suspense had to come for me to really weep for what God showed me.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.960]   I then realized the second dream I'd had the same night was connected to the first.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.280]   Because in the second dream, God had shown me someone who was in need.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.960]   God had shown me somebody who needed hospital fees.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.320]   God had shown me the need of this person, but I had not called that person, I had not
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.920]   provided for that person, and I had certainly not prayed for that person.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.440]   God called me out and weeping, I told the people I was in the prayer meeting with, and
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.840]   we're all weeping and repenting, because every single one of them realized they had done
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   the same.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.440]   In the busyness of life, especially in Hong Kong, we can sometimes be so too busy to even
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.320]   look at the need around us.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.280]   But I believe God has even created today, this Sunday, for us to pause a little bit
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.740]   and see the need around us.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.160]   The last two weeks, Pastor Andrew has really been unpacking what justice is, and it's been
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   amazing.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.880]   I'm not theologian, but today I'm going to unpack as well what branches of hope needs,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.800]   and we believe all of us need, and that is love.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.440]   In the first week, Pastor Andrew spoke about four key relationships.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.200]   Us with God, and it seems from the dream I was doing well with that.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.780]   Us with ourselves, I'm not sure about that because it wasn't revealed.
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.360]   But us with others, I wasn't doing so well there, and then us with creation.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.280]   Today we're going to focus on us with others, and in particular with branches of hope.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.160]   Last week, Pastor Andrew mentioned that you cannot call yourself a Christian and remain
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.220]   distant to the injustice in the society around you.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.640]   When the plight of the asylum seekers and refugees in our church became so glaring,
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.340]   we could not keep quiet.
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.880]   We had to step forward.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.200]   We had to see.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.960]   We had to weep and begin to speak about what people were experiencing in this church.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.800]   And not only that, branches of hope and the ministry of Arise was birthed from this need.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.880]   And year after year, the voice of branches of hope has become louder and louder and louder
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.400]   because of the love, the prayers, and the generosity of the people in this room.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.480]   The love, prayer, and giving of you has changed many lives and given hope to those in a dire
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.600]   situation.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.880]   We also learned last week that the local church, the body of Christ, is always called to walk
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.440]   towards the community and love it.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.520]   But in order for us to know what this love is really about, we're going to unpack a little
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.000]   bit of the Greek word for love in Matthew 22, verse 37 to 40.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.360]   There are actually four Greek words I want to speak about, and the last one is what we
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.480]   see in Matthew 22.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.940]   So philia love, this is a brotherly love.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.920]   This is an affectionate kind of love based on feelings and proximity.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.160]   And then there's storge love, which is the family love.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.000]   This is a bond created in being a family.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.100]   When I look at storge, nowadays I've got a teenage daughter, and she seems to be leaning
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.040]   more on philia than storge, but that's okay.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.140]   Then there's eros love.
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.080]   This is a love normally based on feelings and passion for each other.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.700]   But today we want to focus on agape love.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.280]   This is a sacrificial and unconditional love.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.240]   While philia, storge, and eros are basically primarily a love of emotion, agape is not
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.320]   primarily an act of feelings, though it can be involved, but a love of devotion and acts
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.840]   that flow from God.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.720]   This kind of love in Matthew 22, verse 37 to 40 is agape.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.440]   Today we're going to also look at some scriptures related to agape, because in the New Testament,
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.520]   agape is mentioned over 100 times.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.120]   That means it's very important.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.200]   But today we want to look at some of those scriptures, not all 100, but some of those
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.840]   scriptures in order for us to see what the definition of agape really is.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.040]   So turn with me to 1 John 3, verse 16 to 18.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.540]   We know what real love is, because Jesus gave up his life for us.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.980]   So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.560]   If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister in need but shows
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.440]   no compassion, how can God's love be in that person?
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.840]   Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.760]   Let us show the truth by our actions.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.360]   This is a real scripture, everyone.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   Maybe sometimes you're like me, and I sometimes skip through some of these scriptures and
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:49.640]   think, "Oh, I know what God wants me to give," until God calls me out in a dream and says,
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.640]   "Pause.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.680]   You need to look around you and really see."
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.460]   It is selfless, unconditional, and it flows from God.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.520]   This is what we see from the scripture.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.420]   It flows from God.
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.420]   It is selfless.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.960]   It's looking at others.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.760]   It is purposely looking for the need around us.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.400]   God gave us his best, so we should also give our best.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.220]   The love that God has poured in us during when we got saved is the same love he feels
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.040]   we should pour into other people.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.800]   The primary way we share is action-oriented.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.600]   The primary way God showed his love was action by sending Jesus Christ.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.080]   The primary way he wants us to show our love is an action-oriented thing, by giving our
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.120]   time, by giving our resources, by giving our energy, by giving our prayer, and yes, by
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.920]   even giving financially to those who are in need.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.440]   It is expressed through actions and deeds and not just words like we've just said.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.840]   Turn with me to James 2, verse 8 and 18.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.120]   It says, "Yes, indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the scriptures.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.840]   Now someone may argue some people have faith, others have good deeds, but I say, "How can
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.960]   you show me your faith if you don't have good deeds?"
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.560]   I will show you my faith by my deeds.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.160]   Agape is a doing word.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.120]   Well, the other three are primarily nouns.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.120]   If you don't remember, you can go back to your English.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.320]   Agape is a doing word.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.980]   To truly live out the word agape, we must partner our words with our actions.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.580]   We must also move forward with our deeds.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.400]   It is also a work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.640]   Recently, we were having the Holy Spirit series and Galatians 5, verse 22 to 23 came up, but
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:52.640]   the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives, love, joy, peace, patience,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.880]   kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.400]   There is no law against these things.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   When we were learning about the fruit of the Spirit, the word love in that verse is agape.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.920]   We cannot agape in and of ourselves.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:15.440]   We need the Holy Spirit to help us to agape because it is countercultural to agape.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:22.680]   Where a culture says we give to get something back, agape says I would disadvantage myself
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.720]   for the good of others.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.480]   I recently came across a friend sent me the story of Yvonne Roberts, the Welsh revivalist.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.120]   He was a revivalist, a leading part of a revival in Wales in 1904 to 1905.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.240]   Through the work of the Holy Spirit, there was a lot of prayer during that revival.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.200]   There was a lot of people getting saved during that revival.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.940]   The prisons were emptied during that revival.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:56.280]   But the most amazing thing was there were no more people in need in Wales during that
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:01.720]   time, during that revival because everybody was led by the Holy Spirit to begin to go
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.700]   to the churches and begin to give whatever the Holy Spirit was compelling them to give.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:16.600]   What a beautiful view of how God wants us to meet each other's needs.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:29.960]   "It should flow from us to others just as it flowed from us to God, from God to us.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.800]   It should flow from us to others just as it flowed from God to us."
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.720]   In John 13, 34 to 35, "So now I am giving you a new commandment.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.680]   Love each other just as I have loved you.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.600]   You should love each other.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.360]   Your love for one another will prove to the world that you're my disciples."
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.880]   And the love should not stop with us because there are other people who need to see this
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.040]   love.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.400]   God pours it into us so we can pour into other people.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.740]   In Branches of Hope, we serve some people who don't know God.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.680]   And the only way they will want to know God is when they see the love flowing from us
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.720]   to them.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:18.160]   So with these four verses, we will go to an extended definition that I came up with.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.880]   And the new definition for agape is, "It is an unconditional, sacrificial love that flows
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:31.640]   from God through the Holy Spirit and leads us to acts of selfless love for others."
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.140]   Essentially, it is what Andrew spoke about and described in the first week, being willing
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.600]   to disadvantage ourselves for the advantage of our community.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.320]   I truly believe that if everybody gave what God asked us to give, there would be no lack
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.840]   in the church of God.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.800]   There would be no lack in the kingdom of God.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.440]   This is a beautiful picture of how God has equipped each and every one of us to meet
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440]   each other's needs.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.320]   It's like a God community where no one lacks anything, whether it is prayer, whether it
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:09.520]   is fellowship, whether it is resources or anything, because at any given time, we probably
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.760]   need one of those.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.240]   And at any given time, we probably can give one of those.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:20.080]   Allow me to share some of the acts of love that have been expressed to some of our clients
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.600]   through Branches of Hope recently.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:29.120]   Our stop program recently helped a man called Saul, a father of three from Indonesia, who
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.880]   had sold his most prized possession, a rice field, to cover a broker's fee who had promised
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.680]   him a high-paying dishwashing job in Hong Kong.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:44.080]   When he arrived in Hong Kong, his dreams were shattered when he discovered the job was a
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.080]   lie.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:50.160]   His tourist visa expired, and his limited English made it difficult for him to navigate
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.120]   the immigration requirements to go back home.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.240]   Thankfully, Stop's Indonesian caseworker, Dedi, accompanied him from the immigration
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.680]   office to the shelter and through the courtroom.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:08.000]   Dedi interpreted and guided him through the complex administrative and legal processes.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.960]   Saul was ultimately given a non-custodial sentence in order to return to Indonesia.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.280]   Stop bought his ticket and helped him secure business startup funding from the International
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.280]   Organization for Migration.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.800]   At the airport, Saul was overjoyed and grasped Dedi's hands tightly, his eyes shining with
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   gratitude.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:38.400]   The assistance Saul received not only sent him back home to safety, but it gave him a
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.320]   new lease of life.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.920]   You might have also read the story of Lisa, an asylum seeker from Russia, in the Branches
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.480]   of Hope article published on World Refugee Day.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:55.640]   Lisa is one of the 200,000 people in Hong Kong that Andrew spoke about last week who
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.120]   live in a 100-square-foot home.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.360]   She lives with her son, James, in a subdivided flat in Hong Kong.
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.120]   As she waits for her case to go through the lengthy process, she cannot work and has to
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.960]   survive on the limited government allowance.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.600]   Through the generous donation of someone through the Branches of Hope Star Program, which provides
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   an allowance for utilities, we will hear more about it later, Lisa and James can now use
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.960]   their fan and have the lights on for longer.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:33.120]   This has not only provided a more comfortable environment for them, you know the heat in
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.080]   Hong Kong, now they can turn their fan on.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.960]   But it has given them a space for learning for James.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:49.120]   So we're not only meeting the current needs, but we are speaking into destiny and the future.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:55.840]   Through the Road and Star Programs, our clients, they feel seen by us.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.960]   They feel heard, that somebody cares.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.540]   They feel cared for.
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.460]   They feel comforted.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.320]   They feel covered.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.600]   They feel hopeful.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.680]   And essentially, they feel loved.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.760]   They feel agapid.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:20.120]   They feel agapid by us, just like we want to feel agapid by the community around us.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.720]   The impact of other people's giving to Lisa and Paul and Saul have far greater impact
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.960]   on their lives than the people giving no.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.080]   They are giving more than money.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.440]   They are letting them know that they're not alone.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:42.080]   What may be a meal for us is destiny for someone else.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.280]   Last week, Andrew gave us a model of engagement.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.400]   And in that, he talked about Jesus weeping.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.000]   And that was a key part for Jesus.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.560]   He had to weep before he could speak.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.600]   I believe for us, it's also very key for us to be able to really see and not just weep
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:08.080]   physically, but maybe weep emotionally, connecting to the situation, not just mentally connecting,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.200]   empathetically connecting to the needs of the community around us.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:19.600]   Today we're going to play a four-minute audio video in order for us to approach and really
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.360]   see.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:28.440]   Just a warning, there are sounds of violence for those who are sensitive in this audio.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   But this is not a story told by pictures and words, but it is by the sounds one might encounter
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.800]   along the perilous journey to safety.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:45.080]   We invite you to close your eyes or even look at the subtitles on the screens.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:53.200]   Whatever you feel will make you immerse in the situation and the experience.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.760]   And imagine yourself walking in their shoes.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.080]   At the end of the audio, Alex, the executive director of Branches of Hope, will come on
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.280]   stage to lead us through a collective exercise to drive home just how odious this journey
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.200]   from struggle to hope is.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:16.640]   So please have the resource packs placed on your seats ready, and let's listen together.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.520]   >> Everyone, my name is Alex.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.360]   I'm the executive director at Branches of Hope.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.920]   How was that?
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:33.680]   I wonder if it was a way for you to approach this community a little bit more.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.440]   The audio journey that we just heard is based on real stories that community members have
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   told us over the years.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.560]   And of course, it reflects primarily the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers, but those
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:53.360]   that we serve through the Stop Trafficking of Persons program are no less terrifying
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   and traumatic.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.600]   Even if your eyes are not filled with tears at this point, what we hope is that your hearts
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:10.400]   are ready to weep for the injustice that this experience symbolizes, and that we can collectively
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.800]   move from empathy towards compassion.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.600]   As Taz mentioned, to do that, we're going to go through a little bit of an exercise
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   together.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.560]   All of you should have gotten a little bit of a card on your chairs when you came in.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.100]   This is a resource card.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.000]   And these resources reflect the resources that were needed along this audio journey
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.920]   that we just heard to get from one stage to the next.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.600]   There's eight resources in total, but not everybody has all eight resources.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.000]   And so to demonstrate ultimately how difficult this journey is, I'm going to ask all of you
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.280]   please to stand.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.520]   Please stand with me.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   Don't be shy.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.680]   We're all doing it together.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.100]   And basically what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out these resources one
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.540]   by one.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.080]   And if you have that resource, well done, you get to keep standing.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.960]   But if you don't have that resource, I'm going to ask you to sit down.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.200]   So we're going to start off with the first one.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   If you remember in the story right after, you know, the interruption of violence, they
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.520]   had to pay a bus driver to get out of there.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.440]   If you have on your resource card the money for the bus, you can stay standing.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.320]   But if you don't, please sit down.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.840]   Check your resource card.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.040]   Oh, Pastor Stephen's out already.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.760]   My goodness.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.640]   Now, if you have on your resource card, if you have passports for yourself and your family,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.640]   stay standing.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.880]   But if you don't, sit down.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.880]   If you have on your resource cards the savings to pay for flights, you may stay standing.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.960]   But if not, please sit down.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.780]   If you're one of the lucky people that on arrival to Hong Kong has a visa, you can stay
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.100]   standing.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.400]   But if not, please sit down.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.560]   If you are able to communicate in Hong Kong with English or Cantonese, you can stay standing.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.520]   But if you don't, please sit down.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.000]   You can see that slowly but surely we're all starting to sit down.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.040]   If you have money for food and shelter, you can stay standing.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.000]   But if you don't, please sit down.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.920]   And if you have local connections and resources, you may remain standing.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.440]   But if not, please sit down.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.520]   At this point, there's only a handful of people remaining standing.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.080]   And those who are standing should have all eight resources on their card, the final one
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.520]   being having your claim as an asylum seeker accepted and receiving refugee status and
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.800]   being resettled to a third country.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.600]   If you can see around the room, the only ones who are left standing at this point, that's
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.400]   about 1% of the total auditorium capacity.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.320]   99% of you are sitting down.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.560]   99% of you have not actually made it to this point of protection.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.040]   You have been thrust back into the turmoil that we heard.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   Thank you, you guys can sit down.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.280]   Thank you so much.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.320]   I think, honestly, this is what makes my heart reap the most.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:29.560]   This idea of like being so close to ultimately safety and thriving your life and to just
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   then being sent back.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.760]   And the fact is that not only is it hard to get to Hong Kong, you need all of those resources
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.200]   to get here, and not everybody has those resources.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:48.440]   But then in Hong Kong, less than 1%, over 99% of those who actually come to Hong Kong
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:23:00.540]   ultimately fail in their seeking of protection and get sent back to their home countries.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:06.000]   Like branches of hope, what we try to do is we try to come alongside the community and
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.800]   we try to cut through the noise and the anxiety of what we just heard and ultimately support
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.600]   them along their journey from struggle to hope.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:21.240]   We provide them with the care and the empowerment that is necessary to lead them to better futures.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:27.040]   Without organizations like ours, the time in Hong Kong would be much more difficult.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:34.600]   A life caught in existential conundrums and the only room for personal growth being daily
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.600]   survival.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.640]   That's it.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.960]   And let's be brutally honest for a moment.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.240]   For the majority of the people we serve, the vast majority of the people we serve, there
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.680]   are no straightforward solutions.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.360]   It is a life in perpetual limbo.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:58.080]   But this is why the work of branches of hope is a conscious and radical act of sacrificial
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.880]   love of agape, what Taz was mentioning and what Ed had referenced just earlier when he
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.880]   was sharing.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.360]   Thank you so much, Ed, by the way.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.200]   That we carry out every single day.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.920]   I want to reflect on the powerful messages we've heard over the past three weeks about
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:19.400]   justice, compassion, righteousness, and the call to love one another.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:25.240]   Each sermon has reminded us that our faith is not just a private matter, but a communal
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:32.320]   calling, a calling to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our God.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:39.440]   At branches of hope, we share that calling and we will continue to pour agape into others,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:45.780]   God willing, as long as he pours love into us and into all of you.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.780]   The communities we serve might not be our flesh and blood and they may certainly not
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.200]   be in a position to reciprocate in the season that they are in, but that's not the point.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.240]   We can still and we must still love them regardless.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.820]   We must show them more than just empathy.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.880]   We must practice compassion.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.300]   We must act.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:13.760]   It is this conscious, radical, and continuous act of love of agape that is the linchpin
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.480]   connecting everything that we do at branches of hope with this day, once a year with all
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:23.440]   of you, to the message that Taz shared today, to Andrew's sermons before that, and to the
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.360]   whole social justice mission of Divine Church.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:33.400]   If God has poured his love into you, I pray that nothing should restrict the onward flow
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.840]   of that love.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:41.160]   And if I may dare be so bold, I pray that you direct some of that flow to helping us
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.080]   serve the communities God has put on our hearts.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:51.160]   I pray that agape brings you to approach these communities, the refugees and asylum seekers,
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.960]   those who have experienced trafficking and labor exploitation, the vulnerable, the marginalized.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:03.520]   And I pray that as you approach, you do not just see their needs, but your heart is broken
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.600]   for what breaks God's.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:15.280]   And that this is what causes you to weep, not just for, but with our brothers and sisters.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.760]   If these prayers are answered, if your agape overflows, and you approach, and you see,
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.160]   and you weep, and if it is genuine, I know in the depths of my heart that the only God-ordained
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.680]   outcome of this is that you will be compelled to speak and to help us speak for the communities
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.080]   we serve.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.200]   That is the only logical conclusion.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:44.520]   I'm asking you to pour out some of what God has poured into you, to support us in our
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:50.520]   conscious and radical act of love, and to help us speak for the communities we serve.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.720]   Last year on Branches of Hope Sunday, your tithes and offerings provided the casework
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.880]   support for hundreds of people every single month.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:05.520]   Your outpouring of love allowed us to run dozens of workshops for migrant workers.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   And your prayers have sustained us as a team and as individuals to keep doing the work
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.120]   that we do.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.960]   Your generosity laid the foundations for the launch of our STAR program, which is a monthly
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:25.920]   financial assistance program providing rent and utility support to hundreds of people.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:31.640]   Your support has also made it possible to weather fluctuations in donors.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.820]   With your help, over the last few months, we have been serving over 240 people every
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.520]   single month with this assistance.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:46.000]   And as amazing as that is, it only represents a third of all the people who have been asking
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.680]   and applying for this assistance.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.640]   A third.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:59.600]   Together, we can do more.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.200]   With your support today, we hope to continue providing the casework support so essential
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.940]   to our communities, and we hope to increase the post-secondary education assistance to
[00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.360]   cover five students for their tertiary education.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:16.400]   With the help of a new team member, we hope to revive our adult education and development
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.080]   services.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.440]   And besides supporting us with your tithes today, you can also sign up to become a monthly
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.860]   donor, a monthly supporter at our booth outside.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.200]   You can choose for whatever purpose you want to have your support going to, whether it
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:38.380]   is the STAR program, or whether it's our education programs, or even our general service fund.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.720]   The bottom line, though, is that any regular amount will help us provide financial stability
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.680]   to hundreds of people.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.000]   Let me give you an example.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.960]   If just ten people from this service today make a commitment that every month you will
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.500]   donate $250, that's maybe two lunches worth.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.980]   If you donate $250 every single month, ten of you, that would be enough money for us
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.760]   to be able to provide the STAR program assistance to five more people.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.040]   If we have ten people from every service today to sign up to do that, we're supporting 15
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   more people.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.560]   It's that simple.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.260]   And if you feel truly overwhelmed with compassion and the agape of God, then maybe the time
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.880]   has come for you to prayerfully consider a career with Branches of Hope.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.520]   We always have opportunities and are looking for Christians to serve alongside us to do
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.500]   the work that we do.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.880]   For all of these things, for all of the things that might catch your interest, please speak
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.000]   to my colleagues outside.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.980]   They're very, very friendly and very happy to help you out.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:48.720]   To those of you who have been walking so faithfully alongside us and the communities we serve
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.360]   all of these years, we cannot thank you enough.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.220]   And to those of you who may only just be getting to know us or have not felt necessarily the
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.240]   call to support us yet, I pray that today is an encouragement to you to embrace our
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.120]   mission.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:09.560]   I pray that the Holy Spirit moves among you to give and give generously out of compassion
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.980]   and conviction.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.260]   May your love be like the water gushing from the rock in the desert.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:21.400]   May God bless and multiply your offerings so that we may continue his work and together
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:27.380]   support the communities we serve in their journey from struggle to hope.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:33.060]   Most importantly, though, I pray that these past three weeks have been a blessing to each
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:39.580]   and every one of you and that it has offered restoration in your relationships with God,
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:45.860]   your relationships with yourselves, your relationship with each other, and your relationship
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.300]   with creation.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.740]   May we all continue to grow to be big people.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.740]   Thank you.
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.740]   Wonderful.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.540]   I wonder if you could all stand with me.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:04.720]   And we're going to now move into a specific time together of agape-ing through our giving.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.300]   And I want you to understand something really importantly right now.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:13.740]   100% of what is given in our tithes and offerings across our service today, whatever is given
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.460]   in this moment across our services today, are going to Branches of Hope.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.820]   So none of this is going to the vine.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.620]   It's not going to our normal upkeep.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:26.460]   100% of what you give right now is going to give immediately to Branches of Hope and the
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.800]   work that you've been hearing about today.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.100]   So your tithes and offerings today are connecting directly with that need.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.300]   In a moment, you'll have the opportunity to give like you would normally do.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.620]   You'll have our hosts pass out the buckets amongst us.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.860]   On your chair, there's the usual giving envelopes that you see every week.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.580]   You can fill that in and whatever.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.620]   Again, all of that money is going to go directly to Branches of Hope.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.700]   Behind me in a moment, you'll see the digital ways to give like normal.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.060]   100% of that goes to Branches of Hope.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.260]   That's what we're going to do right now.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.500]   This is a practical way for us to support this organization.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.380]   Then after the service, you can by all means connect with them more, have a look at that
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.940]   merchandise, maybe sign up for that monthly support as well.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.300]   I wonder whether we could do this in a place of an attitude of just the Spirit being amongst
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:15.100]   us, the joy of what it is to be a part of the gospel, to serve in this way.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.740]   So would you just close your eyes with me and bow your head?
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.500]   Father, we are grateful that we are a worshiping community.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.740]   By a worshiping community, we're not just singing songs to you.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:29.780]   We're living lives that reveal the gospel to the world.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.980]   We thank you for what Taz has beautifully shown us out of scripture today.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.340]   That's agape love that is not a feeling but an action.
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:43.900]   We thank you that as we've heard from Alex, that there are very practical, direct needs
[00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.860]   that are within this community that our giving today is going to support.
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.580]   Lord, I want to pray now.
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:53.660]   I want you just to take a moment.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.420]   This is the part of the services just between you and God.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.740]   But just take a moment.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:04.780]   Just ask the Holy Spirit to impress upon you how you are to react and act today.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:10.940]   What is it that the Lord might be calling you to give as your tithes and offerings?
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.700]   And what is it that he might be asking you to do to continue to support the work of Branches
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.140]   of Hope in the months ahead?
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.220]   So we just invite you to come Holy Spirit.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:25.660]   Come Holy Spirit.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.260]   And we're going to do this act of offering through a moment of worship.
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.840]   Our band are just going to lead us in a time of worship and the hosts are going to hand
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.860]   out the buckets to you.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:39.180]   Let's celebrate together as we give joyfully and cheerfully to the work of Branches of
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.420]   Hope.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.000]   (gentle music)
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.580]   (gentle music)
