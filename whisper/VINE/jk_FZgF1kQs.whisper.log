[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   Yeah, actually, Philip, why don't you come up here?
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.200]   So this is Pastor Philip.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.680]   He's, let's welcome him, yeah?
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.640]   He's a colleague and a friend,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.360]   so he's the young adult's pastor in one tribe.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.360]   And you know, one thing that always strikes me about Philip
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.200]   is sometimes you meet people who just have
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.080]   a genuine, deep, personal relationship with Jesus.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.240]   You know, and that's something that I always see in Philip,
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.960]   just when he talks, when he prays for me, when we share.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.880]   You know, it's somebody that lives in that intimacy.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.920]   And so I'm always blessed, so I know we'll be blessed also
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.640]   by what God has spoken to him.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.360]   Also, his wife, Christina, and Cyril are here as well,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.840]   so we're excited to have all of you,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.160]   but I would love to pray for you and for us,
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.280]   so let's stretch our hands and let's pray.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.920]   Jesus, thank you so much for Philip,
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.480]   for your work in his life, for your calling,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.080]   for your anointing.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.760]   Pray that, Holy Spirit, you strengthen him,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.000]   empower him today to deliver what you have spoken to him.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.440]   And Lord, I also pray for us as a church
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.760]   that you would open our hearts, our minds,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.000]   for what it is that you wanna speak,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.120]   and that we would be ready to respond to what you say.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.720]   We pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.120]   - Amen, thank you, Tim.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.640]   Hello, exciting to be here.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.360]   So, you know, if you do see me in Yuen Long or in Wan Chai,
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.440]   just call me Philip.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.960]   I feel the more endearing term is just Philip, you know.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.800]   Anyway, we're back in this Longing for Healing series,
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   and I am so excited, particularly because I also possess
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.520]   a chronic health condition.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.160]   Some of you might know of it from our January devotions.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.280]   I'm gonna share a little bit more about it.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.680]   But, you know, starting in my youth,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.400]   I was always circling and marking places in the gospels
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.800]   where it talks about Jesus's healing,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.360]   as I prayed for that healing to also take effect
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.400]   and take place in me.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.040]   And so today I'm just gonna share what God's heart
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.760]   is on healing for all of us,
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.040]   and maybe there is something for all of us to learn.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.880]   The over the past few weeks,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.720]   there was one important point that we learned about healing
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.480]   and that God's healing is universal.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.280]   God's healing is for all.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.120]   And as I was mincing these words,
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.960]   two things really draw out.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.920]   One is that when we say that God's healing is for all,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.040]   we're talking about the non-discriminatory nature
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.240]   of God's healing.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.040]   God wants to heal regardless of our status,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.960]   regardless of our condition,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.480]   regardless of what religion we have, what gender we are.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   So it's regardless of what disposition it talks about worth,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.560]   he doesn't care, he gives healing in that way.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.720]   This is very important because we, as Pastor Tim shared,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.440]   we also play a part in each other's healing.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.000]   We are agents of healing,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.120]   and we don't wanna get in the way of God's healing
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.560]   just because we have a different opinion
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.920]   about who should get healed and who shouldn't get healed.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.120]   Okay, so I talked about the non-discriminatory nature
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.120]   of why healing is universal.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.960]   Now I wanna talk about the breadth of healing.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.080]   It is for those who are seeking physical healing like me,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.120]   it is to those who are seeking
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.540]   under the service kind of healing,
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.960]   some deep psychological, mental, social,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.040]   any types of healing that we can't really see in the outside.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.640]   And if we go even one step further,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.800]   and I'm talking about the breadth here,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.440]   we're talking about people
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.840]   who aren't necessarily seeking healing as well.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.520]   Healing is also for them.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.320]   Healing is for those who think,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.040]   actually, I'm quite fine on a perfectly fine day.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.680]   There isn't much or any to heal from.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.520]   And we believe that God's breadth of healing,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.200]   also there's healing taking place for them.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.580]   Healing is discipleship.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.200]   And so if we draw together the non-discriminatory nature
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.280]   and the breadth of God's healing and why healing is for all,
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.000]   we come to this message today.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.680]   We arrive here and we can say, hang on,
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.200]   maybe that this message is also for all.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.840]   Healing is for all, this message is for all,
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.940]   and nobody could actually be complacent here
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.180]   to say, actually, it doesn't apply to me.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.680]   And so with this, how about we go into today's message?
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.480]   Notice here in today's message,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.480]   Zacchaeus, which we're gonna be talking about in Luke 19,
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.160]   he wasn't necessarily seeking healing as well,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.320]   if we notice it.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.420]   If we know the story,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.400]   he was trying to get on the tree to see Jesus,
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.880]   and he wasn't after anything.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.160]   And yet, the irony of picking this story today
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.720]   for the Longing for Healing series is making this point,
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.900]   that this message and that healing is for all of us.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.900]   So why don't we read together Luke 19, verse one to 10.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.280]   You can follow me on three, one, two, and three.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.680]   Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.320]   A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.480]   He was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.000]   He wanted to see who Jesus was,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.600]   but because he was short, he could not see over the crowd.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.200]   So he ran ahead and climbed the sycamore fig tree
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.400]   to see him.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.600]   Since Jesus was coming that way,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.120]   when Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him,
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.840]   Zacchaeus, come down immediately.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.440]   I must stay at your house today.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.440]   So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.520]   All the people saw this began to mutter.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.560]   He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.160]   But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.320]   look, Lord, here and now,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   I give half of my possessions to the poor,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   and if I've cheated anybody out of anything,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.960]   I will pay back four times the amount.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.560]   Jesus said to him, today salvation has come to this house
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.120]   because this man too is a son of Abraham.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.840]   For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.960]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.440]   So as we read the passage, it doesn't take a fine eye
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   to notice that something is quite not pleasant with Zacchaeus.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.000]   We know everything that Luke writes about
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.760]   has been handed on to him by eyewitnesses.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.600]   And so as we are Luke's audience,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.520]   we can really gauge the sentiment in the room.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.560]   We can exactly visualize what's happening here
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.320]   that nobody really likes Zacchaeus.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   The first descriptions already tell us how far off
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.760]   he fared in his own people's estimate.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.400]   He's a tax collector, and assumedly,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.040]   he was made very wealthy from tax collecting.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.160]   And it wasn't just that the people didn't like pay taxes.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.160]   My green envelope just came in this April.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.840]   I guess none of us gladly anticipate the green envelope
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.160]   that comes in our mailbox every year.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.520]   And yet, we know that the tax collected
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.400]   actually goes into the public system
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.520]   for at least some sort of good.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.760]   And so we don't have a personal kind of hatred
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   on the officers and the inland revenue.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.360]   And yet, for Zacchaeus, the people had it going against him.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.320]   It was very personal.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.680]   And the reason is that the tax collected
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.400]   didn't just go back into the local public systems.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.560]   Instead, it was a tax Zacchaeus collected
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.480]   in collaboration with the Romans.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.440]   Whatever money that was collected,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.320]   and after meeting the Roman quota,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.040]   Zacchaeus could pocket this money as his own.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.680]   And he was able to do so on his own people
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.480]   because the Romans had afforded him the authority.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.200]   So in effect, Zacchaeus betrayed his own
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.880]   with the national enemy at the time
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.360]   and made a living out of dishonest gain.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.920]   The tax collector, the term the tax collector,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.960]   is so detested in Jewish society that it
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.520]   is used in conjunction with another term, sinner.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   And all sorts of foul language one could think of,
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.040]   you would use it and mix it all with the term tax collector.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.080]   And think about this.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.040]   Out of all of them, Zacchaeus was chief.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.880]   He was chief tax collector.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.720]   OK, we're going to top up some more unpleasantness
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.360]   on the image of Zacchaeus.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.920]   Verses 3 and 4 makes mention of his stature,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.400]   that the crowd was too tall for him,
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.200]   and that Zacchaeus had to go up a tree just to be
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.720]   able to see Jesus come through.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.720]   So Luke is not just simply passing on information
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.120]   as objective facts here, but he needs us to read the room.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.000]   When do we ever see short people climb trees?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.680]   Can you just detect the sour negativity here?
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.000]   It's not just facts here.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   It's not how many centimeters, but actually a short person
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.560]   climbing a tree.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.200]   He also wasn't just short like how Pastor Tim kind of towers
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.400]   over us and how he sees all 90% Hong Kong people.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.720]   But he is abnormally short.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   Zacchaeus was like a dwarf.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.440]   He had a dwarfism stature, someone
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.280]   who was abnormally short.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.200]   And the crowd is not just too tall for him physically.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.520]   The crowd is not simply just physically towering
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.080]   over Zacchaeus and overshadowing his sight for Jesus.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.480]   That is just the face value of the reading.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.760]   Sure, sometimes things can just physically
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.520]   get in the way of us meeting with Jesus, missing a bus.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.720]   That's a physical thing.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.440]   And yet the debilitating thing here
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.840]   is that Jesus was unnecessarily kept out of reach and sight
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.120]   because of the social stigma and perception
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.960]   that the crowd had placed on Zacchaeus.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.800]   And so we see it in verse 7 with the people's
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.200]   whinging and muttering.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.000]   Jesus has gone to be the guest of a sinner.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.880]   Again, in this verse, it's not an objective fact here.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.000]   They're actually grumbling and moaning
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.360]   that somebody, a sinner, is actually
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.840]   tagging alongside a moral teacher in those days.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.920]   So if we are honest to ourselves,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.440]   at times we have been like the crowd, whereby
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.760]   we choose to serve our emotions on who should rightfully have
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.920]   access to God's grace and mercy, rather than playing ball
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.120]   in the spirit's leading.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.160]   In the past years, depending on political sides,
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.760]   we have seen different people groups and nationalities
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.240]   and occupations fall from faith and grace
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.040]   because we have associated with one side of the opinion.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.800]   We have consciously or unconsciously
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.560]   viewed these people groups and nationalities and occupations
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.520]   in a lesser light.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.520]   And what this means is that by virtue,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.520]   we have given up on God's very opinion about people
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.640]   and adopted, because we were serving our own emotions,
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.480]   adopted our own instead.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.200]   We have become the very tall crowds
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.040]   that have gotten in the way of letting people see Jesus.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.960]   Has that got anything to do with a healing perspective?
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.720]   Yep, it also applies.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.920]   Even when Jesus is very powerful and Jesus is sovereign enough
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.480]   to decide to heal anyone at his disposal,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.240]   we are supposed to be partners of Jesus.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.640]   And the way that we can get in the way
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.400]   is that people don't want to seek healing
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.720]   in the first place.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.200]   They're overshadowed by this social stigma and perception
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.360]   that they don't even want to have healing in the first place.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.560]   And so today, if you just find two minutes
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.960]   and if you find that this really applies to you,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.240]   maybe just spend two minutes with Jesus
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.840]   just to reclaim his opinion.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.280]   It could just be like, Jesus, I know
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.240]   that your healing is universal and irrespective of worth.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.480]   Sorry, I was wrong about this particular person or occupation
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.880]   or people group.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.920]   And I wish to partner in your activity
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.920]   again of letting the person see you and your church
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.240]   in the right light.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.600]   OK, we're going to move on.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.160]   And we're going to do a little bit of forensics.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.440]   We're going to do some internal investigation on Zacchaeus.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.320]   We're going to investigate and name the deeper
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.720]   wound inside of Zacchaeus.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.160]   What was the problem with Zacchaeus
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.520]   that had caused him to essentially turn
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.680]   against his own people?
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.800]   And as I was finding answers, I simply
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.240]   couldn't help but realize that Zacchaeus is actually
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.000]   a brother of ours.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.560]   And so any speculation made against him, it has to be fair.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.800]   But it also has to be for identification's sake.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.600]   Identification is not judgment.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.480]   Identification is saying, I can identify
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.000]   with this person.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.280]   I can share in the feelings.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.400]   I really understand what this person means.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.480]   Because that's what Jesus's incarnation was about.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.280]   Jesus came into this world, and he identified with humanity.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.040]   He didn't judge humanity.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.520]   God is growing a very compassionate church globally,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.880]   but also here in Yuen Long.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.040]   And our motives need to be holy as we probe
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.680]   into the lives of others.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.720]   And we can start doing that in our scripture reading
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.080]   when we come across the tax collector, or Judas,
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.920]   or this person, Zacchaeus, or the Levites
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.600]   who passed about the Samaritans and just walked through.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.280]   Actually, spend a moment just to identify with these people.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.680]   Why are they doing these things instead
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.960]   of the normal Sunday school children's school routine?
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.040]   Oh, he was a baddie.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.200]   He did this, and this, and that.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.680]   I think that's going to nurture us
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.120]   into a very compassionate church that Jesus would like to see.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.920]   Anyway, back to Zacchaeus, something is not quite right,
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.560]   not quite coherent with him internally, emotionally,
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.720]   morally, spiritually.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.840]   And if we were using contemporary language,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.560]   we're going to say he's a broken mess.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.720]   How can somebody make it a living deeply hurting
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.960]   his own kind without feeling guilty?
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.640]   There are possible reasons here.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.560]   Either Zacchaeus didn't regard his ways of tax
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.520]   collecting being wrong, which is quite doubtful because he can
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.640]   really read the sentiment in the room,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.880]   or he wants to justify this action
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.240]   and rationalize this decision because people
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.440]   have bullied him.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.760]   And so it was a time for him to dominate and assert power
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.840]   over those who had bullied him, or those he otherwise couldn't
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.240]   because of his short stature.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.760]   Or possibly a third reason, and it's just indifference
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.040]   and apathy.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.120]   Zacchaeus was so hurt that there was just
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.200]   a lack of moral concern over what he did.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.480]   So out of all these examples, anyway,
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.580]   out of all these possibilities, we
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.560]   don't see a lot of guilt in Zacchaeus,
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.160]   but we see a lot of shame in Zacchaeus.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.080]   Now, as Hong Kong people, we might use these words
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.800]   interchangeably and not knowing the difference.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.200]   Pastor Tim gave some really good definitions of Brene Brown
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.160]   the other day.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.280]   I'm not going to go and dwell on it,
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.600]   but I want to talk about the difference here.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.200]   Different from guilt, shame actually
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.760]   focuses on the negative evaluation
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.880]   of the whole entire person rather than the single
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   perceived offense that we do when we're guilty.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.200]   And in effect, this inward turn to negative self-evaluation
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.520]   left Zacchaeus so stuck in a cycle of humiliation
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.440]   and idolatry where holding on to money and power,
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.480]   even at the expense of his own people,
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.200]   was the temporary antidote to deal
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.920]   with his ostracism and pain.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.640]   And this is why we see people going
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.200]   to very obsessive and addictive regimes
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.320]   when they navigate around shame.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.600]   And for Zacchaeus, his way of dealing with shame
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.720]   was to amass and accumulate wealth and power.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.400]   Shame is so detrimental to a person's holistic health.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.000]   It clouds out every judgment.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.080]   The way we see ourselves, the way we see right and wrong,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.080]   shame leads us into a life of sin, addiction,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.800]   and unhealthy living.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.360]   We only need to turn a few pages into the second story
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.680]   of the Bible, and we know that because of sin
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.080]   and because of rejection, Cain had turned against
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.120]   and actually killed his own brother, Abel.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.320]   Shame leaves us so isolated from God and others,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.360]   and it is so dangerous because we were never
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.160]   called to be on our own.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.920]   We were called in the first place
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.600]   to be in a loving community, just like our triune God.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.880]   So at the very beginning, I shared a little bit
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.040]   about my condition.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.280]   And for some of you who don't know,
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.280]   or the many of you who don't know,
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.640]   I have lived with eczema for the majority of my life.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.040]   And when we say chronic, what we mean
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.280]   is that the condition is long lasting.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.640]   It doesn't really have a cure to.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.000]   And for the longest time, I've prayed against it.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.480]   I've prayed for it to go away.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.960]   And we know with eczema, if you know about eczema,
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.720]   it doesn't really fall off.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.360]   If you pass adolescence age and you still have eczema,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.680]   you pretty much have eczema, and you can expect
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.760]   to have eczema forever.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.360]   And I prayed for it to go away because it has
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.160]   all sorts of problems in me--
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.920]   the pain, the sleepless nights, the itch, very itchy skin,
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.920]   and attributing to all these problems,
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.840]   I actually also carried a lot of shame in me.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.040]   If you think about the names and the labels
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.840]   that I had when I was in school from teasing schoolmates,
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.280]   if you think about my daily commute to work
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.080]   or to the groceries, and I was always
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.200]   hoping that I'm not getting stared at for shedding off
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   my flakes.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.680]   To the people, maybe even you guys who really love me
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.120]   and yet still fail to understand why this guy can't
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.080]   stop itching.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.640]   And so all these kind of things and experience and events
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.800]   just spiraled off to shame, and it also
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.500]   spiraled off to a lot of unhealthy living inside of me.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.120]   I remembered a time in my undergraduate--
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.760]   and there was one year in my undergraduate university life
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.040]   where my attendance was at a mere 4%.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.720]   Think about it.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.760]   I remember that year so clearly.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.440]   Not actually sure when it was day or night
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.360]   because I had my curtains shut.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.840]   And it didn't really matter anyway
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.160]   because I wasn't turning up to lectures.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   But this pain and this shame just
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.080]   led me into just hiding in my dormitory,
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.680]   just binging on the screen or binging on movies and games.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.480]   And after that, I would just fall back into sleep,
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.160]   and it just rinses and repeats.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.960]   What I didn't know, why God didn't take away
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.720]   the physical healing, although I was blaming him
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.960]   on the physical healing, I even told him,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.480]   hey, couldn't you just give me a condition that
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.760]   isn't shown outside, in the outside?
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.880]   But what I didn't know is that God actually
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.360]   wants to do a deeper healing in me.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.640]   And without that experience all till today,
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.280]   I wouldn't have received such deeper holistic healing.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.520]   And I would have just sufficed on maybe a clear skin.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.640]   And maybe internally, I would still have a very poor image
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.880]   about myself.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   So we know that shame has such a negative impact on us.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.280]   So what are we to do?
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.440]   Wretch people that we are.
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.520]   Paul says, wretch people that we are.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.560]   What can we do?
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.320]   Thankfully, that's the wrong question
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.040]   to be asking because it's not something that we can do.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.880]   And it is only Jesus who could do something and save us
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.680]   from this problem.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.800]   On our own, we can't come out of shame.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.480]   And we see this clearly here in the slide.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.800]   It is Jesus who initiates Zacchaeus in this story.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   It is he who came to seek and to save the lost.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.000]   It is he who must enter our empty and lonely homes
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.280]   and to get rid of the shame off of us.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.640]   So in the Bible, there are actually two ways
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.040]   where Jesus deals with shame.
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.400]   The first one we can see here, Jesus
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.600]   is repeatedly portrayed as somebody
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.520]   who refuses to buy into the culture of shame.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.840]   He befriended those whose society labeled as sinners.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.440]   He defied social customs around the notion of who's holy
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.880]   and who isn't holy.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.280]   He pronounced God's blessing upon those
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.000]   who had been stigmatized.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.200]   He also tells a lot of parables and stories
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.600]   about people with no social standing or religious standing
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.440]   being ushered into God's kingdom and presence.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.040]   And this is the story that we see.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.080]   This is one way of Jesus dealing with shame.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.480]   Moreover, Jesus deals with our shame by carrying it.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.920]   When Jesus faced death by crucifixion,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.520]   by dying on the cross, he was publicly
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.520]   shamed in every possible way.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.800]   He was stripped naked.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.800]   He was mocked.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.520]   He was physically abused.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.840]   He was labeled a blasphemer and a traitor.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.120]   He was nailed onto a cross.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   And the biblical accounts of Jesus's death
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.160]   attach great significance to the fact of this public shaming.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.120]   Because Jesus was, in a sense, carrying this shame
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.440]   on our behalf and in our place, shared the burden of this shame.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.240]   And in bearing this, he had robbed the power of shame.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.320]   Such a debilitating power, he robbed it away
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.440]   through carrying it for us.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:20.640]   And this is why Apostle Paul would later say, "From now on,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.960]   and therefore, we don't see anyone
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.760]   from a human point of view.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.400]   For in Christ, there is a new creation."
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.360]   That's a verse that we always go back to whenever
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.440]   somebody is baptized.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.880]   And I was just wondering, are we seeing ourselves
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.720]   in a human point of view here?
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.160]   Brothers and sisters, are you seeing each other?
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.240]   This is the best place to learn about this.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.000]   Are we seeing ourselves in a person point of view,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.960]   in a flesh point of view?
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.120]   Or in Christ, a new creation point of view?
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.640]   Husbands and wives, are you doing the same in your houses?
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.880]   Are you looking at each other as new creations?
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.520]   So when sin and shame and all sorts of deep wounds abound,
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   we can know that God's grace abounds even more.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.000]   I'm borrowing Paul's language here.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.280]   Experiencing such profound acceptance and healing
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   from Jesus, there's only one appropriate response.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.040]   And the response is one of repentance.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.760]   We might like to think of repentance
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.120]   as somebody goes off their very high horse,
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.920]   saying sorry for what they've done,
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.800]   an offense that they have created or made.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.400]   But that's only repentance in part.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.840]   Repentance, if we go back to the original language,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.640]   means turning towards God, a turn towards God,
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:50.160]   and also another turn, a turning away from wrongdoing.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.600]   And Psaki has fully embodied repentance
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.000]   because firstly, he turned to Jesus.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.640]   Look, Jesus.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   He said that.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.200]   But he also turns into his actions later on.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.320]   So essentially, he's saying, look, Jesus,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.720]   I've put a lot of emphasis in finding security and comfort
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.960]   in holding and amassing this money and power.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.280]   And that is idolatry.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.600]   I should be seeking that comfort and healing and security in you.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.320]   And yet, I've looked on it.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.880]   I try to look for it in money and power.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.720]   And so letting go of these idols,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.160]   it also means that he is seeing Jesus in a new light
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.080]   with worship and with praise.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.240]   The turning in repentance also means turning away
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.360]   from wrongdoing, as I said.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.560]   And as I said, with shame, there's
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.360]   not much we could do in our own selves, this negative feeling.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.200]   But if we have guilt instead, there's
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.920]   something that we can do.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.960]   As long as we are turning Godward,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.960]   there is a positive effect, feeling guilty sometimes.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.480]   And it is for our repentance.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.520]   The feeling of guilt, if we are turned Godward,
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.920]   it can potentially lead us to wanting
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.160]   to make up for the offense.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.440]   And for Zacchaeus, to make up, it
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.280]   means to make up the broken relationships that he
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.160]   has with his own countrymen.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.000]   Regardless of what is perceived of him, what
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.160]   was said and done to him, Zacchaeus
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:30.400]   initiates and he lets go of escalating this old offense
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.840]   with a 180 degree turn.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.080]   He turns money extorting into charity giving.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.600]   And such radical liberation is found
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.720]   in a man who is met by the love of Jesus
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.520]   and healed from of his inner wounds.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:50.080]   In the end, Jesus leaves no room for doubt.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.160]   There was no second guessing on where Zacchaeus now
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.080]   fares in Jesus' eyes, in God's eyes.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.720]   If Zacchaeus was still unsure the moment Jesus locked eyes
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.560]   with him, called him down the tree, called his name,
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.080]   and without any upfront judgment to say that he
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.520]   has to go to his house, by verse 9,
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.280]   Zacchaeus could put this to bed.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.720]   He can put this doubt to bed.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.640]   Jesus really loves him.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.360]   And if we were to paraphrase verse 9,
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.240]   I would paraphrase it this way, that Jesus just
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.720]   assured Zacchaeus that he is one who belongs to him.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:36.240]   So I wonder whether we can leave today's message knowing
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.480]   that God also has assurance for us.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.920]   No matter how we deem and evaluate our own selves,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:50.320]   no matter what we think of in terms of our distance from God,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.600]   or no matter what we've done, actually, last year, last month,
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.760]   or last week, regardless of all this,
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.600]   we can know that Jesus is very close to us.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.440]   Or in a healing perspective, regardless
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.280]   of whether we are cured, regardless of whether we're
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.440]   waiting on healing, regardless of whether healing has not
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.840]   come yet, or for those who have given up on healing altogether,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.200]   Jesus gives his assurance today that he is very close to us.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.160]   And that is his estimation.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.240]   And we better ought to start applying that estimation
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.200]   on ourselves as well.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   God brings his final verdict.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.080]   And it's not because of what we have done,
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.000]   but because of what Jesus had accomplished
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.560]   in his humanity and divinity.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.400]   Can I welcome the band up again?
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.440]   I just want to do a bit of ministry time.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.560]   So as you guys get ready, can we all
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.320]   stand as we go into a time of ministry?
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:02.560]   So with the message that we just preached,
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.680]   I'm mindful that there are a few ways that we can actually
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.120]   go about this.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.360]   Maybe there are friends here who are yet to be Christians.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.240]   Jesus wants us to know that he is very close to us.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.800]   And despite our brokenness, he insists
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.080]   on knocking on that heart door and hoping
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.360]   to come into your homes, your heart homes.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.640]   And so like Zacchaeus' story, I wonder
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:34.480]   whether we could, in repentance, start a relationship with him
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.040]   today.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.160]   It could just be, sorry, God, for the things
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.040]   that I've done up to this point, the sins that I've committed.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.720]   Thank you for loving me in such a way so that I am one of yours.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.160]   I am a child of God.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.540]   And then for those of us who are in Christ,
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.280]   we can also have a moment welcoming Jesus
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.200]   through our repentance.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.660]   First, we are going to turn to God.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.680]   And then we're going to talk about some of the wrongdoings
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.920]   that we might have committed.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.640]   Notice that repentance isn't just the moment
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.840]   that we get saved, the sinner prayer,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.560]   but repentance is this every frequent now and again thing
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.560]   that we do every so often for discipleship, for healing.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.440]   We know that God has a very longstanding care and affection
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.400]   for us.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.100]   And we can trust that actually in the repentance,
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.980]   there's also healing that is coming through.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.320]   When we lock eyes with Jesus and we hold on to that loving gaze,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.520]   we know that we are far from his standards.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.360]   And there is some shame and there are some guilts
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.960]   that he wants us to address.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.760]   So firstly, it's the shame.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.200]   God, I'm just so sorry for not seeing myself
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.000]   in the way in the estimation that you see me.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.320]   Notice that I can't take this away.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.200]   Notice shame.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.660]   It's just so detrimental to me and that you
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.600]   need to take it away.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.160]   Lord, would you let me see the new creation in me?
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.960]   And now God wants to address our guilt as well.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   Jesus, I'm so sorry for the things that I've done
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.440]   and also the things that I've not done,
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.560]   which I know that I shouldn't be doing or I should be doing.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   And the gift that you've given us
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.200]   allows us to know right and wrong.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:38.680]   Lord, I want to hold on to that, hone in, and really use it
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.320]   as my compass again.
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.040]   Lord, I obviously, through these offenses and these wrongdoings,
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.360]   I've also mucked up in some relationships.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.480]   And I need you to heal me.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.080]   And I need you to lead in these relationships.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.600]   And I need you, Holy Spirit, to give me a new revelation
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.000]   how to lead me in these new relationships.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.240]   So we're going to pray.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.640]   And we're going to talk about these three things, OK?
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.120]   Everybody, let's join.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.280]   Let's not just leave it to non-Christians
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:20.040]   to do this welcoming Jesus in our life prayer.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.720]   So if you repeat after me, Heavenly Father,
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.160]   thank you for loving us.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.760]   Thank you that you have met with me today again.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:38.080]   And I know that you're knocking on my door.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.960]   So I just wish to fall into your lap.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:50.160]   I want to start a relationship with you.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   I also want to confess my sins.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.360]   Notice I've done something that I'm not proud of.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:09.400]   But in your loving and forgiving,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.640]   I know that I am a child of God.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.240]   And so I want to thank you for letting
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.640]   me become your own children.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.080]   OK.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:27.680]   And if we follow after me again to address those categories
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.640]   again, the shame and the guilt. Father,
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.400]   I have such a poor image of my own self.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.120]   If you do.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:42.480]   Lord, I try to use other ways to navigate around this.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.720]   But it's always temporary.
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.640]   And so Lord, would you remind me of how you take away our shame?
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:03.040]   So that I can see myself in a new light.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:14.080]   Thank you for dying on the cross for me, bearing my shame.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.440]   And it is no longer for me to carry.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.720]   Father, I'm also guilty.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.400]   I've hurted others.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.840]   I've done something wrong.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.600]   Lord, thank you for the fact that I know that I've
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.480]   done something wrong here.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.440]   The fact that I know that I've done something wrong.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:46.400]   Lord, I want to turn to you and turn away
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.560]   from these wrongdoings.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:58.440]   Install a new law in me so that I don't need
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.720]   to do these things anymore.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:10.320]   And Lord, if there is anything that I've mucked up,
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.440]   Lord, would you restore them?
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.480]   Especially relationships, because they
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.800]   matter to you the most.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:29.200]   Would you lead me in these relationships
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.240]   as we see healing come through?
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.320]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:37.800]   Amen.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.640]   (water splashing)
