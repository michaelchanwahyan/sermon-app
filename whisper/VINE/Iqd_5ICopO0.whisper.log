[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   No one likes waiting.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   I was in the MTR last week at Thim Sa Chui.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.800]   I ran down the escalator to get my train to Central.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.000]   I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the platform sign.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.400]   The train will arrive
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   in four minutes.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.400]   Aiyah!
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   Four minutes!
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:48.600]   But what about the 400 silent years?
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.400]   The time between the last writings of the Old Testament
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.400]   and the appearance of Christ is known as the Intertestamental Period
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400]   or Between the Testaments.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   It lasted from the prophet Malachi about 400 BC
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.400]   to the ministry of John the Baptist
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   whose birth we look forward to today as we kick off our Advent series, Surprising Joy.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:33.400]   Because there was no prophetic word from God during the period from Malachi to John,
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.800]   some refer to it as the 400 silent years.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:49.200]   To set the scene, I want to read a couple of verses from Luke chapter 1.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.600]   Verse 13, "But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.000]   Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.'"
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Good name, that one.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.600]   Verse 63, "Zechariah asked for a writing tablet."
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.000]   No iPads in those days.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   "And to everyone's astonishment, he wrote this.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.400]   His name is John."
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   His name is John.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   Now the story of Zechariah and Elizabeth is quite personal to me.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.000]   My father was 51 years of old when I was born.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And I was actually his firstborn.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.600]   My mom had been widowed.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.400]   Could you imagine the excitement of having your first child at that age?
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.600]   My father's name was John Henry Snellgrove, to be precise.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:11.000]   But I was born on the 23rd of April, which in the UK is known as St. George's Day, our patron saint.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So my mom decided to call me George.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   But dad had other ideas and promptly went out to register me, I guess after a celebration drink or three.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You guessed it, he said, "His name is John."
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   John Henry Snellgrove, Jr. made his entry into the world.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And by the way, no calling me George after the service.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Anyway, let's get back to the sermon.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I think sometimes in church, in our sermons, we are guilty of what I call verse picking.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Reading only verses that suit our sermon story.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   But today in our Advent series, and Chapman has already told us about the first coming and the second coming of Jesus,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   we ask ourselves three questions.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   The first one is this, what does Advent mean?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And the answer is coming.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Who is coming?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Jesus.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   What are we to do?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Get ready.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So as part of getting ready, I'm going to read the whole passage, 21 verses in one go.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I'm reading from Luke chapter 1, starting from verse 5.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   In the time of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   His wife, Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commands and decrees blamelessly.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But they were childless, because Elizabeth was not able to conceive.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And they were both very old.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Once, when Zechariah's division was on duty, and he was serving as a priest before God,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   he was chosen by Lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple and to burn the incense.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshippers were praying outside.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Then, I love that word, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   He will be a joy and a delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or any other fermented drink.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   to turn the hearts of the parents to their children, and the disobedience to the wisdom of the righteous,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Zechariah asked the angel, "How can this be? I'm an old man, and my wife, well, she's well along in years."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   The angel said to him, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and I have been sent to speak to you and tell you this good news.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   because you do not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time."
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   When he came out, he could not speak to them.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   but remained unable to speak.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   When his time of service was completed, he went home.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   After this, his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   "The Lord has done this for me," she said.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   "In these days, he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace amongst the people."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   So quite a long passage, and there are three key themes in this passage.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   The first theme is Zechariah and Elizabeth's long years of barrenness.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   We can assume that Elizabeth and Zechariah are well past childbearing age.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   We're not told their exact age, or John's birth would not have been considered a miracle.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   We are told in verse 7, "But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   and they were very old."
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Anecdotally, they would probably be in their 60s, and if they were in Hong Kong,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   they would qualify for a Joy-U card and pay $2 for travel.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The second theme, the key theme, is the silence of God after centuries of prophetic absence.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I've already described it, the 400 silent years.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   The announcement of John's birth breaks the silence, bringing unexpected joy.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Not only for Elizabeth and Zechariah, but also for Israel.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   This leads me to ask ourselves,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   have you ever experienced a significant desert season in your life?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Let me repeat it.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Have you ever experienced a significant desert season in your life?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I've chatted to a few people recently who have described to me a long season of doubt,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   confusion, spiritual dryness, or a long season of waiting for God to come.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   A long season of waiting for something that they long for in their life.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Using my MTR analogy, most of us don't even like the experience of short waits.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   If you've ever been to McDonald's, you go in and you go, "What's the shortest queue?"
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   "Can I get in the shortest queue?"
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   "Oh good, that you've actually got in the shortest queue until the guy in front of you orders 14 Big Mac meals."
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   I read that collectively people spend about 67 billion hours a year waiting in lines.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And even this small task can be a test of our patience most days.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Even in the short waits, the feeling of uncertainty about their end,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   and the feeling of it being unfair, like the guy with the 14 Big Mac meals, makes us struggle.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   But then there are experiences in life that involve not just minutes, but months, and even years of waiting.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   It can feel like a desert, or like barrenness.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   This kind of waiting doesn't just test our patience, it tests our hope.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   As pastors, Sandra and I have walked with countless couples wrestling with childlessness.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It's so hard, especially those who are desperate to have a family of their own.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   But barrenness can take many forms.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   It can look like eight dryness in your life, a loss, loneliness, rejection.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   It can be some relationship not yet reconciled, or something you've been asking God to do in your marriage or in your singleness.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   It can look like a pain or injustice you've endured, and are asking for healing and restoration.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Or some, and I know this is many of us, struggle like depression.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   You keep asking God to do something.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   God, do something new!
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   But the change hasn't come yet.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   For many of us, the waiting changes us.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And yet somehow, some of us are able to keep our hearts alive in the barren places.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Zechariah and Elizabeth were among a people who had experienced a lifetime waiting in desert circumstances.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   The nation of Israel was waiting for the promised Messiah.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And Zechariah and Elizabeth, who were very old and barren, were longing for a child.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Their story shows us two ways of responding when God shows up in those dry, hopeless places in our lives.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   One is skeptical.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   The other is full of wonder.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And we ask the question, what is the difference between them?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   How can we keep our hearts soft and hopeful so we don't miss God when He shows up?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I wonder, for Zechariah, if maybe the experience of God with him in his waiting wasn't personal for him anymore.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I can't imagine what it was like for him.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   All the years, all the years of asking for a child.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   The waiting, the possible stigma of unfaithfulness that others would have felt towards them.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Oh, God hasn't blessed you because you're not faithful enough.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Even though they had lived incredibly faithful lives.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   My friends, waiting without answers and without an end in sight can be excruciating.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I think of some of our Asylum Seeker friends here at the Vine.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I was speaking at the Arise Fellowship last week and I noticed some of them who've been with us for up to 15 years
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   without their case getting settled and, to be honest, nowhere near their case being settled.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   In a foreign country, no access to an ID card and limited benefits and even more limited prospects.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Waiting is so difficult and often the waiting changes us.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Maybe Zechariah had changed somehow in the waiting.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   He clearly kept going through the motions. He was faithful in his duty.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   He continued to pray for the redemption of Israel and to believe that God would send Messiah.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   But, maybe he'd lost hope that God would show up in his own personal desert.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   So, when God shows up in, I have to say, an incredibly theatrical encounter to get his attention
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and give this personal announcement that he would indeed have a son.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   At first, Zechariah misses what God is doing.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I don't know if you know, but there were nearly 18,000 priests who were each on duty two weeks a year.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   They cast lots to see who would burn the incense and offer prayers.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   If you get chosen, you can never do it again.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It's a once in a lifetime opportunity and some people would never get chosen.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Let's read what happened as Zechariah gets chosen.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Verse 8.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   What we're going to see is while he is there performing this holy, ancient service for Israel,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   an angel of the Lord shows up to tell him he's going to have a son.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Then the angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are called him John."
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   God shows up and Zechariah, you can see it, can't you? He's wondering, "How can I be sure?"
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   He says this, "How can I be sure of this? I'm an old man.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   My wife is getting on a bit as well. Went along in years."
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   He's scepticism. He has everything he needs to believe that God could do a great thing for him.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Firstly, he's a priest. He holds the stories of God's faithfulness to others like Abraham and Sarah.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   He has the stories of his own life and this supernatural encounter.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It's pretty statistically reliable evidence that if an angel shows up and says that God is going to do a thing, God's going to do that thing.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   But what he experiences is scepticism.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   It's almost like he stopped believing that God will do anything like this for him.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   It's not personal anymore.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Maybe under all of our struggling with the deserts of our lives is this fear.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   This loss of faith.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   "Oh, we can believe that God's going to come through for other people."
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   But maybe not just for us anymore.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   On the other hand, Elizabeth responds differently.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   She hears the news in a very different way.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Possibly just her old, mute husband scribbling a note to her or making hand gestures.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   She probably also notices a few changes in her body.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   But there were no sonograms or ultrasound.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   There was no way to be certain.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   She could have thought she was crazy or maybe just ill.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   But somehow she believed not only that God could do such a thing,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   she believed He would do such a thing for her.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Can you see that?
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It's one thing to believe that God could do it.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Another thing, that God will do it for me.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And she said this, verse 25, I'll put it on the screen.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   "The Lord has done this for me."
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It's personal to her.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   It's not just about the redemption of Israel.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   But it is also about God showing up in a very personal way for her and Zechariah.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   It has a feeling of intimate worship as we read how she stays in seclusion for five months.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And then later when Mary visits her, a song of worship pours out of her heart.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   But it leads us to the question, what about us?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   What about us?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   The story of Elizabeth and Zechariah makes me wonder,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   how can we keep our hearts soft and hopeful when we encounter deserts in our life?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   What are a few ways we can keep our life with God personal?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I want to suggest a couple of things.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Number one in this Thanksgiving week, remember and be thankful.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   It helps to remember ways He has shown up for us before and for those around us.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Being thankful is a way of acknowledging His active work around us
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   and reminds our hearts that He is not far away.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Passively watching our lives evolve.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   He is close and He is acting on behalf of those He loves.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   To be honest, if I had unlimited time today, I would go around the congregation
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   and ask you all to say one thing that you are thankful for.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Maybe just think about that now.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   What are you thankful for?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Remember it and be thankful. That's number one.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Number two, nurture an intimate friendship with God.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Everyone does this differently.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   But any relationship requires time and presence,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   listening and learning in order to grow.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Reading or listening to scripture, praying,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   learning to listen to the voice of God,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   finding ways to glimpse how good and just how faithful God is
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   often leads to worship because it's our natural response to be in awe
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   and we are reminded of God's greatness and His love.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And the third one is be around spiritual family.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   When the desert is hard and testing our hope,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   we need people in our life who will remind us
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   that God still knows our name.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   He still sees our life and that He will come through to us.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   If you're not in a community group or a small group, get in one now.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Be around spiritual family.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   We may not get to encounter with an angel,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   but Jesus is always showing up in our lives.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And if Jesus is always personal for us,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   we can find flourishing even in the desert.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Let me finish with an illustration.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   There are parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   where no rain has ever been recorded.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Scientists believe that portions of the region
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   have been in extreme desert state for 40 million years,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   longer than any other place on earth.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And yet, more than 1 million people live in the Atacama currently.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Farmers have found ways to extract enough water
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   from underground water supplies and snow melt streams
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   to grow crops and raise llamas and alpacas.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   In 2015, a portion of the desert received a historic rainfall,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   just under one inch of rain in one day.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It may not seem very much,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   particularly those of us who come from England,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   but it was the equivalent of 14 years of rainfall
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   for this region all in one day.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   And this desert that had already found a way
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   to thrive and sustain more than 1 million people
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   was now also covered in a beautiful layer
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   of pink and purple bloom after the rain.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Let's look at the picture.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   My friends, this is a picture of your life.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Yeah, take it. Share it. Post and tag. Go on.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   This is in the driest place on the whole earth.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   What a picture.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   My friends, the message of this Advent
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   is that Jesus has come to take away the barrenness of the world.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   He can make us flourish and bring beauty
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   even in the deserted places of our lives.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   If you are in a season of waiting,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   how is the waiting changing you?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Maybe today, yes, today,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Jesus wants to renew your hope
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   that he is showing up in the barren places of your life.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   As I ask the band to come up,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   I'm going to ask you just to close your eyes for a moment.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   (Pause)
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   We're going to pray now as a church
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   for anyone here who is waiting.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   I suspect it's many of us.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Maybe you're like Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   You're a couple waiting for a baby,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   waiting to get pregnant.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   It hasn't happened.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Maybe you're waiting for that relationship.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   When is God going to bring that person into my life
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   that will allow me to walk through life with?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Maybe you're waiting for a job or a job opportunity.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Maybe you're waiting for a time
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   just to get out of the depression you're in.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   You've got that sort of mood around you
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   and it's around you the whole time.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   How long is this going to go on for, Lord?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   When am I going to see joy again?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Whatever it is, if you're waiting today,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   we're going to pray for you.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Keep your eyes closed for a moment.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   If you're waiting for something, whatever it is,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   just put your hands up and we're going to pray for you.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   If you're waiting for something.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   (Pause)
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Just open your eyes, everyone.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Keep your hands up.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   If you're around these people, just go and lay hands on them.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It's not too late.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   People who have got their hands up, can you just go around?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   This is not me praying for everybody.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   This is not the way we do church.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   The church prays for the church.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Find a person with their hands up.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   There are people all over the place.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Please look.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   If you haven't got your hands up, go and pray for someone.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   (Pause)
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Come on, guys, I need you to be part of this.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   (Pause)
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   If you're waiting, I'm not going to ask you what you're waiting for.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   It'll be different for each one of us.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   There's a lady at the back waiting.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Some people at the back waiting, can people go and pray for them?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   (Pause)
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Come on, this is part of us growing as a church, growing as a family.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   When we see people in our family struggling with something,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   to go and reach out to them.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Just reach out your hands to them.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   You don't have to pray the most wonderful prayer.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   But just lay your hands.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Just say, "I care.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   You're my family.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Divine, you and Long.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   We're building a family here."
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And if you're waiting, we're waiting with you.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   We believe that God is going to come through.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   (Pause)
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.840]   continue to pray.
