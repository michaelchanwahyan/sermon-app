[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   We pray for us, we pray for our hearts to be open
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.520]   to hearing from you God, and we give you glory
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.600]   for what you're about to do in this sermon.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.000]   So in your name we pray, amen.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   - Amen.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.760]   - Promise I didn't tell you, him and I are also
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.120]   remaking Rush Hour 4 soon, so that's what's really going on.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.360]   Well, good morning, it's good to be here as always,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.960]   and an honor to start a new sermon series together.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.320]   I wanna tell you a story, another story before we start.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.240]   So before I became, joined Full Time Ministry,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.120]   I used to be a kindergarten teacher.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.720]   And so as a kindergarten teacher, of course,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.040]   we told a lot of stories, story time,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.640]   circle time with our children.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.960]   And so I'm gonna tell you one of the favorite stories
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.040]   I used to share with my kindergarten class, okay?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280]   It's called Tadpole's Promise.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.160]   All right, so crisscross applesauce,
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.360]   if everyone's sitting comfortably,
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.760]   I'm gonna tell you a story.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.260]   Once upon a time, on the edge of a beautiful pond,
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.300]   where the willow met the bay,
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.340]   lived a beautiful tadpole and a caterpillar.
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.020]   They were best friends, the tadpole and the caterpillar,
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.500]   and were deeply in love with each other.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.220]   The tadpole would call the caterpillar his beautiful rainbow,
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.260]   and the caterpillar would call the tadpole
[00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.660]   her beautiful black pearl.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.220]   "I love everything about you,"
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.380]   the caterpillar would say to the tadpole.
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.940]   "You are my beautiful black pearl.
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.540]   "Promise me you'll never ever change."
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.540]   And the tadpole said, "I promise.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.540]   "I promise you that I will never change."
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300]   But the next time they met,
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.140]   the tadpole had grown two little legs,
[00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.780]   and the caterpillar was heartbroken.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.700]   "You broke your promise to me, tadpole.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.980]   "You said you would never change, but now you have legs."
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.100]   And the tadpole said to the caterpillar,
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.220]   "I'm sorry, I don't want these legs at all.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.380]   "All I want is my beautiful rainbow."
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.460]   And so the caterpillar said, "OK, I'll forgive you,
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.860]   "but promise me you will not change anymore."
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.100]   And the tadpole, "I promise.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.980]   "I promise you I will not change."
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.940]   But sure enough, the next time they met,
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.980]   the tadpole changed again.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.340]   He had arms, then he had lost his tail,
[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.140]   and each time he would make a promise not to change,
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.660]   he could never keep his promise.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.860]   He kept on changing.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.620]   And so in the end, the caterpillar said to him,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.220]   "You have broken my heart too many times, tadpole.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.540]   "You are not my shiny black pearl anymore."
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.540]   The tadpole thought to himself,
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.580]   "But you will always be my beautiful rainbow.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.100]   "I'm sorry.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.020]   "You've changed too much.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.060]   "I never want to see you again."
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.660]   And with that, the caterpillar crawled up
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.100]   onto the highest branch she could find,
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.100]   and she cried and cried.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.940]   She cried so hard and so long
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.140]   that she formed a cocoon around her
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.460]   and fell asleep for a very long time.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.740]   Now, some time passed,
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.860]   and when the caterpillar woke up,
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.500]   everything had changed.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.020]   She was now a butterfly with beautiful wings.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.260]   The season had changed.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.420]   The sun was shining.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.460]   The grass was green.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.820]   The flowers had bloomed.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.980]   But what didn't change was what she had in her heart
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.820]   for her shiny black pearl.
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.500]   And so she decided to fly down to the river
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.620]   to find him and to forgive him.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.020]   And as she flew down to the river,
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.900]   a frog was sitting on the lily pad.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.940]   "Excuse me, Mr. Frog, have you seen my..."
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.140]   But before she could say, "Beautiful black pearl,"
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.860]   the frog jumped up and ate up the butterfly
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.260]   in one big gulp.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.060]   Emotional damage, huh?
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.580]   Wow.
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.340]   What a story.
[00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.820]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.460]   Well, what a story, right?
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.940]   In those two minutes,
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.300]   we went on a rollercoaster of emotions, right?
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.300]   You guys were listening.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.700]   There was love, friendship, cuteness,
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.020]   heartbreak, shock, and horror.
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.900]   You were drawn in.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.460]   You were listening to the story.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.540]   Why?
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.860]   Right, because stories carry power.
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.260]   Stories are powerful, right?
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.780]   Which is often why when people want to teach something
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.700]   or explain something, they do so through stories, right?
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.620]   We have not just this story, fairy tales,
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.900]   countless fairy tales, right?
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.780]   These cute little stories
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.380]   would often have a deeper meaning behind them.
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.220]   And Jesus knew this.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.100]   In fact, a lot of how Jesus taught,
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.820]   Jesus chose to teach through stories
[00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.380]   because he knew they had power.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.140]   And the stories Jesus told are known as parables.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.460]   And if you read through the Gospels
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.620]   in the Matthew, Mark, and Luke,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.260]   Jesus taught through these parables to draw people in,
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.820]   to get them invested, but to make them think about truths,
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.620]   truths about his message,
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.460]   truths about the kingdom of heaven,
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.460]   and to declare him who he was and the character of God.
[00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.820]   These parables, as people heard them,
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.540]   invited hearers into a new reality
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.380]   that Jesus was trying to open their eyes to,
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.300]   the fact that the kingdom of heaven
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.300]   is surely but slowly taking over this earth.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.700]   But the difference is that Jesus' stories
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.780]   weren't just supposed to be like cute little tales
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.780]   that he told with a little moral truth.
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.780]   They were actually meant to shock and to shake our world.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.300]   In fact, one of the reasons why Jesus
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.820]   had to use parables to teach
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.060]   is because some of the things he was talking about
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.700]   were so countercultural, so shocking,
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.860]   and so different from what other people were saying
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.700]   that if he had said it directly,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.020]   people would have arrested him straight away.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.500]   Which is why Jesus told parables and stories.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.700]   But then it's also why then he had to explain them,
[00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.460]   tell them what is this story really about.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.660]   Again, because they were so powerful and so dangerous.
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.420]   He had to veil them with a story,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.540]   but then he would go on and explain the truth of them.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.180]   And these stories, even though they're over 2,000 years old,
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.060]   still ring true today.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.780]   So like Promise told us earlier,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.540]   over the next four weeks,
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.020]   we're gonna look at some of these beloved stories of Jesus.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.820]   And together we're gonna study them,
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.980]   we're gonna wrestle with them,
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.460]   and we're gonna ask ourselves how these ancient stories
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.180]   continue to speak truth into our life
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.400]   and our journey with Jesus today.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.420]   It's gonna be good, I really hope so.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.780]   And today we're gonna start with the parable of the sower.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.260]   The parable of the sower.
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.220]   Now, do you guys remember what chia pets were?
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.060]   Are they still around?
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.180]   Chia pets, right?
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.260]   Chia pets were like these potato-looking lump
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.300]   that you soak them in some water,
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.140]   and you water them,
[00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.060]   and then you put them against a windowsill.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.020]   Or maybe that's the first sign experiment
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.180]   some of you guys did, get that little seed, right,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.500]   and put it in the cotton.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.560]   And then sure enough, right, after some time,
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.660]   the seed sprout or the chia seed grows green hair,
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.340]   and that's how they grow, that's how things work, right?
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.500]   Seeds are meant to bear fruit.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.300]   Seeds grow, that's what they're supposed to do.
[00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.860]   In fact, it's all in a part of God's design
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.280]   of how he created this world to work.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.540]   On the third day of creation, God said,
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.140]   "Let the land produce vegetation,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.660]   "seed-bearing plants and trees on the land
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.860]   "that bear fruit with seed in it,
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.980]   "according to the various kinds."
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.540]   So seeds are supposed to grow,
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.900]   seeds are supposed to bear fruit.
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.760]   But in order for seeds to grow and to bear fruit,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.900]   they need good soil.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.280]   In fact, you could even say that soil
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.540]   and fruit-bearing seeds are essential
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.060]   for our survival as humans on this earth.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.880]   Maybe it's not something we think about all the time,
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.580]   but next time you go into a supermarket or something,
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.820]   you're at a parking shop or Welcome or whatever,
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.660]   take a look at all the products, right?
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.420]   Or when you go to the wet market.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.860]   There's fruits, there's vegetables.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.820]   Now, they're all neatly laid in front of us.
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.260]   You know, we can just go and buy them
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.140]   and bring them home and prepare our meals and stuff.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.900]   But think a bit further sometimes.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.980]   Where did this stuff come from?
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.900]   Right, the shelves that are fully well-stacked with products.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.420]   It's easy to forget that all this
[00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.680]   is actually a produce of farming, of agriculture,
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.360]   where seeds had to be planted, were sown into soil,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.160]   and then these seeds bear fruit that becomes our food,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.820]   or it's the food our food eats sometimes, right?
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.820]   The entire world is reliant on seed and good soil.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.600]   In fact, I wrote a little poem, a little haiku, okay,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.740]   to describe this.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.600]   Listen, if the soil is bad, the seeds do not bear us food.
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.780]   Without food, we die.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.600]   Hey, right, it's to the point, shortened to the point.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.760]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.120]   Now, like I said, for us, you know,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.720]   we're a bit detached from this reality.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.800]   But the realities and difficulties in agriculture
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.080]   were a lot more obvious for the people in Jesus' time.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   They would have understood immediately
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.440]   the importance of good farming and seeds
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.600]   that produce a fruit, which is perhaps why often
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.440]   Jesus used farming and agriculture
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.320]   as a way to illustrate his point, right?
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.400]   Seeds and conditions of soil, and what bears fruit,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.400]   what doesn't bear fruit.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.800]   And so this is the heart behind Jesus' parable.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.020]   So we're about to read it, and then after that,
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.640]   we're gonna walk through the parable
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.640]   to learn what Jesus has to say about his kingdom
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.700]   through this story.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.640]   Starts in Luke chapter eight, verse one, it says this.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.780]   After this, Jesus traveled from one town and village
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.000]   to another, proclaiming the good news
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.980]   of the kingdom of God.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.660]   The 12 were with him, and also some women
[00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.720]   who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.320]   Mary called Magdalene, whom had seven demons, had come out.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.440]   Jonah, the wife of Huzah, the manager of Herod's household,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.640]   Susanna, and many others.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.080]   These women were helping to support them
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.320]   out of their own means.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.880]   While a large crowd was gathering,
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.040]   and people were coming to Jesus from town after town,
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.200]   he told this parable.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.480]   A farmer went out to sow a seed.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.460]   As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.360]   It was trampled on, and birds ate it up.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.040]   Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.100]   the plants withered because they had no moisture.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.640]   Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up with it
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.520]   and choked the plants.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.840]   Still, other seed fell on good soil.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.160]   It came up and yielded a crop 100 times
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.620]   more than was sown.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.400]   Now, on the surface, it seems like
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.920]   a pretty straightforward story.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.400]   A farmer goes out, does his thing,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.960]   sows his seeds with various results.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.440]   But when we think about it, when we look a bit deeper,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.440]   there are some unusual elements to this story.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.080]   Firstly, the method of planting seed,
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.100]   the method the farmer used, was a bit unusual.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.240]   Normally, care was taken to make sure
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.960]   that seed wasn't just scattered
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.120]   and the name for doing this in farming
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.360]   is called broadcasting.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.840]   So normally, farmers wouldn't just scatter seed
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.440]   all over the place, but rather, usually,
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.720]   intention was taken to put seeds in a place
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.140]   where it had the best chance to grow.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.280]   Remember also, Jesus started by saying,
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.720]   "I'm talking about the good news of the kingdom of God."
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.820]   So within this context, people were listening to this story
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.260]   thinking, well, what do seeds and birds and thorns
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.540]   and hard ground, all that kind of stuff, have to do?
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.000]   What does that have to do with God's kingdom?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.300]   Now, here's what's important for us today.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.840]   You have just heard this parable, right?
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.240]   You've heard this story, it's drawn you in.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.960]   Maybe as I was reading, you had pictures
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.420]   of farmers throwing seed everywhere,
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.120]   pictures of seed landing in different types of ground.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   But with listening to what we're about to say,
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.600]   we're gonna talk about the explanation.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   And so in listening to explanation,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.060]   there is also gonna come expectation and responsibility.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:30.100]   This is why Jesus says, "Whoever has ears, let them hear."
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.280]   His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.320]   He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of kingdom of God
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.620]   "has been given to you."
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.960]   And so we are gonna look into the secrets
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.280]   of the kingdom of God,
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.620]   explanation that Jesus has given to us.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.560]   We're about to get into the meaning of this parable.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.160]   If you have ears today, you're about to hear.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.960]   You're gonna see and you're gonna understand, hopefully,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.840]   what Jesus is trying to teach us.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.000]   Now, but like I said,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.780]   this comes with expectation and responsibility.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.840]   But because you're about to hear,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.420]   you're about to see and understand,
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.460]   this is going to, it should change your world.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.080]   Because we're talking about understanding God's heart
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.960]   and his kingdom.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.000]   And it's gonna challenge us to do something
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.160]   with the message, with the seed we're about to hear today.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.960]   We're talking about revealing secrets of God's kingdom.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.760]   Once you've seen, once you've heard,
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.160]   once you've understood, you have no excuse.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.520]   And so what I'm saying right now is
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.160]   if you don't want that responsibility,
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.560]   maybe it's best for you can put in some AirPods right now,
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.960]   okay, or I won't even be offended
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.880]   if you go downstairs to PCC, grab a coffee or something.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.760]   It's half-price coffee today, by the way, right?
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.880]   Because Hong Kong won the gold medal, right?
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.960]   So yeah, congratulations, Hong Kong.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.800]   Amazing.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.680]   But honestly, if you wanted to leave right now,
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.120]   I wouldn't be offended.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.080]   But I hope you will stay.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   Because what I've said,
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.480]   through understanding these parables,
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.640]   we are gonna get to know more about who Jesus is
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.040]   and how he's called us to live.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.280]   And this is what being a follower of Jesus
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.440]   is all about, isn't it?
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.120]   This is what our lives should be about.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.040]   So if you're ready, let's hear the explanation.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.960]   Well, Jesus says it himself.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.040]   "This is the meaning of the parable.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.480]   "The seed is the word of God."
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.760]   The seed is the word of God.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.120]   So there's our first reveal.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   It seems that this is a teaching
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.640]   about how God's word works in the different types of soil.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.000]   Now notice this, though.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.800]   The interesting is that throughout the story,
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.640]   the seed is the only consistent thing.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.400]   The seed is consistent.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.800]   The soil changes, but the seed never changes.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.000]   As it says in Scripture,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.200]   "The grass withers, the flowers fail,
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.760]   "but the word of God endures forever."
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   Now, the way the farmer's sowing the seed
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   is through scattering.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.840]   Like I said just now, scattering was an unusual practice
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.600]   because it was seen as wasteful.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.320]   In a time where food was scarce
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.840]   and needed to be grown properly,
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.400]   you wouldn't wanna waste your seed like that.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.840]   The seed was a precious commodity for the farmer.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.920]   So the usual practice would be make sure
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.480]   the seeds were put in places
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.280]   where they had potential for growth.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.120]   So why the scattering of the seed?
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   Why is Jesus telling the story this way?
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.600]   Well, I think what he's trying to tell us is this,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.920]   that the scattering of seed,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.080]   remember the seed represents God's word,
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.120]   the scattering of the seed highlights the fact
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.760]   that the word of God is everywhere and for everyone.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.120]   There is an unusual sense of generosity
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.960]   about how the farmer is scattering his seed.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.440]   There's almost like a joy about it.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.280]   You can almost picture him doing,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.000]   "Yeah, I'm just gonna spread it everywhere.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.880]   "It doesn't matter where it lands.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   "My aim is to spread it as far and wide as I possibly can."
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.080]   He's not eking our living,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.840]   being really stingy with the seed.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.760]   He's not thinking about the seed running out
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.120]   because he knows there is more than enough.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.480]   It will never run out.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.880]   This is what Jesus is trying to say.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.680]   He's trying to say that God's word is abundant.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.560]   And God's heart, his desire is for everyone
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.200]   to be able to encounter it, to be able to hear it.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   God's desire is that nobody shall perish,
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.440]   but everyone has a chance of hearing his word.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.760]   And what do we know about his word?
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.120]   His word is powerful.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.360]   The seed carries with it the potential for growth.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.440]   And the potential of God's word that we carry
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.320]   is also the truth of his love, his salvation,
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.360]   and the great potential to bear fruit.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.760]   Disciples making more disciples.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.000]   But see, this is what happens.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.080]   What happens to the seed, though,
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.520]   depends on the condition of the soil it lands in.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.040]   And there's a few different types of soil.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.440]   The first one is this.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.360]   Those along the path are the ones who hear.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.560]   And then the devil comes and takes away
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.920]   the word from their hearts
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.720]   so that they may not believe and be saved.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.600]   Okay, so this is the second reveal.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.800]   The seed is God's word, and the soil represents people
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.640]   and the condition of our hearts.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.440]   And so for the seed that falls along the path,
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.000]   it tells us it's trampled on,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.320]   and the devil snatches the word away.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.640]   The devil snatches the rest of the seeds away.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.160]   It's important to notice, though,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.280]   that these people have heard God's word.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.320]   It's not the hearing that they've heard God's word.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.680]   The problem is that they don't put their belief in God,
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.640]   and so they don't receive salvation.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.800]   They're not saved.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.240]   They don't believe, therefore they're not saved.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.360]   The heart that is hard, a hard heart,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.440]   will never be able to receive God's word.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.960]   In addition to this, we have an enemy,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.200]   like we said a couple of weeks ago,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.960]   that is actively trying to stop the word of God
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   from taking root and bearing fruit in people's hearts.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.640]   But the enemy's aim is the complete opposite
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.720]   of what God is trying to do.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   Now again, notice, it's not God that stops the seed
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.320]   from taking root.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.520]   It's the hardness of the path.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   It's the bird that snatches it away.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.120]   And Jesus is not shy in telling us
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.040]   the consequences of a hardened heart.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.040]   Because the heart is hard and does not believe,
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:50.840]   these people are not saved, so that they may not be saved,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.080]   meaning they are not rescued and brought out
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.800]   of the consequences of sin and darkness.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.400]   They do not have the life now and the eternal life
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.040]   that Jesus promises for those who follow them.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.360]   Now, if you look back at the story of Luke,
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.320]   until this point, Jesus has actually met a bunch of people
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.600]   with hard hearts.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.960]   People like the Pharisees and the religious leaders
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.880]   who refused to listen to Jesus.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.600]   The villagers in his own hometown of Nazareth
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.240]   who drove Jesus out and even tried to throw him off a cliff
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.160]   and kill him.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.880]   The hardened heart will always reject Jesus
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.840]   and the life and salvation only he can provide.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.400]   So here's the question today as you're listening.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.720]   Has your heart been hardened?
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:46.280]   Scripture tells us, if you hear his voice,
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.040]   do not harden your hearts.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.320]   And one of the first things I wanna say this morning
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.920]   is that for those of you who have heard God's word,
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.720]   but not yet let it sink into your hearts,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.160]   I really urge you today to really,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.160]   really consider this question.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.800]   Have you let the word of God sink into your hearts?
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.200]   Have you received it and not just heard it,
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.840]   but received it and started to put your belief in it?
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.120]   Because if you haven't, the consequences is literally
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.840]   one of eternal life with Jesus
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.480]   or eternal separation from him in darkness.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.800]   So that's the hard heart.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.640]   But there's also those on the rocky ground.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.240]   These are the ones that receive God's word with joy
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.360]   when they hear, but they have no root.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.960]   They believe for a little while,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.720]   but in the time of testing, they fall away.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.520]   So the second group of people are called the rocky ground.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.560]   Like we're saying, right, the seed will grow,
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.160]   but only if the conditions are right.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.680]   And so in the same way,
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.040]   unless God's word actually takes root in your heart,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.000]   it will not be long lasting.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.200]   It's like getting a gym membership at the cost of a new year,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.760]   going for a few weeks and giving it up again.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.840]   Or like the instrument that you swore you'd pick up
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.680]   and practice every day, but now the guitar
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.600]   just sits in the corner gathering dust
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.960]   and you don't know it's out of tune,
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.800]   you don't know what to do with it anymore.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.560]   The same thing happens when it comes to our faith.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.200]   Receiving God's word is an exciting moment.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.880]   Maybe even getting baptized, that moment is so exciting.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.800]   So excited, think back to a time
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.840]   when you first put your faith in Jesus.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.480]   Joy is such a perfect word to describe that moment.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.800]   The hope that you felt,
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.760]   no troubles of this world have finally been lifted.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.760]   Yes, I believe in Jesus now, everything's gonna be okay,
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.920]   I feel great.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:53.320]   But then the adrenaline wears off and the moment passes
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.680]   and the reality of life starts to hit you again.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.320]   You start to face struggle and testing
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.160]   and then your faith, you find sometimes, begins to shrink.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   This is a word for us in this room
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.320]   because there is a danger that this could be us.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.720]   This could be us in this room today
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.520]   and we do not want to be in this category.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.760]   Most of us in this room,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.080]   the majority of us have received God's word.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.600]   We might not even have believing in it for a while.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.760]   The question is, has it taken root in your heart?
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.200]   Because if it has not, Jesus says,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.240]   "When testing comes, you will fall away
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.600]   "and falling away from your faith
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.920]   "is as though you'd never believed in the first place."
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.080]   The consequences of people in this category
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.720]   are the same as those with a hard heart.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.800]   Now this perhaps is one of the most difficult truths
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.040]   about following Jesus.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.320]   Following Jesus does not automatically make life easier.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.880]   A relationship with Jesus is not a magic pill
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.320]   to take away life's problems.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.160]   In fact, many times, believing in Jesus
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.960]   will bring testing into your life
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.240]   and testing comes in different forms, right?
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.960]   Sometimes it comes from temptations,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.840]   the desires of the world, the lust of the flesh,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.120]   the lust of the eyes, the pride of life
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.240]   as scripture describes it.
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.200]   And when these things come knocking on your door,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.360]   when they come to test you,
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.120]   we give in when God's word
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.320]   hasn't fully taken root in our lives.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.560]   Despite the moment of joy that we felt,
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.840]   the temptations overwhelm us and we fall away.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:52.080]   Sometimes though, this testing is even orchestrated by God.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.640]   Scripture also tells us very clearly
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.360]   because the Lord disciplines the one he loves
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.960]   and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.280]   But this is the kind of testing
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.960]   that is designed to refine us,
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.200]   to burn away and cut away things of our life
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.400]   that are not of him, that are not of Christ
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.240]   so that we can live more like Jesus.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.640]   But sometimes when these testing comes too,
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.520]   we reject them, we resent them,
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.760]   we refuse to believe and we refuse to be changed
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.040]   and disciplined and discipled.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.920]   And so we too fall away.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.480]   But Jesus is asking too much,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.000]   like Jethro was praying just now.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.920]   He's demanding too much of my life.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.000]   Only a heart that is deeply rooted in the Lord
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   will withstand all the testing of life.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And we need to be sure
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   that we're not just fair weather Christians
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.200]   because there is no such thing.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.040]   Faith that only appears for a short time
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.080]   is no faith at all.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.920]   Church, this is a warning, this is a pleading.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:04.640]   Do not abandon the love that you first had.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.160]   We don't wanna be like dogs that return to their own vomit.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.760]   We are called to be a people
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.400]   that endures and endures to the end.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.640]   We are called to have a joy in our hearts
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.960]   that is there to stay no matter what comes.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.600]   And for this to happen,
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.000]   the root of God's word must set in your heart.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.120]   Now there's another group of people.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.960]   This is the seed that falls among the thorns.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.080]   And these stands for those who hear,
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.720]   but as they go on the way,
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.520]   they are choked up by life's worries
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.520]   and riches and pleasures.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.720]   And so they do not mature.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.160]   The third group of people are likened
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.320]   and their hearts are likened to seed
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.720]   that grows up amongst the thorns.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.280]   All right, the thorns of life's worries,
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.800]   riches and pleasures.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.720]   And just like the seed before,
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.200]   there is some growth,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.640]   but this growth is stunted.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.040]   It's like an arrested development of these seeds, right?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.080]   They are stunted because of the things of this world.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.720]   Now you don't need me to tell you,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.880]   but the worries in this life are plenty.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.720]   We wanna put on a brave face all the time.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.400]   We wanna walk around and appear as though
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.240]   as nothing has happened.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.880]   Everything is fine,
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.920]   but life is full of worries, right?
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.800]   In this season, I can testify,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.000]   I'll say to you right now,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.600]   worrying is probably one of the biggest struggles right now.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.800]   I worry for, my worries look like these days
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.680]   for my family about able to afford
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.640]   sending our children to school, right?
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.680]   Pay the school fees.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.640]   School bills are expensive, okay?
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.400]   Schooling in Hong Kong can be expensive.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.640]   Whilst trying to save money,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.000]   whilst trying to save for retirement,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.800]   put food on the table, pay the rent,
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.760]   all this kind of stuff.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.800]   This kind of stuff keeps me up at night sometimes.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.640]   At the same time,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:57.000]   my two sons have a genetic condition inherited from me,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.800]   right, that requires constant,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.080]   it's a long-term thing for the rest of their lives.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.840]   They're gonna have to have doctor's visits and observation.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.200]   Day to day, they're doing fine, okay?
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.640]   But it's a worry
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.920]   because each and every doctor visit we have,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.440]   I never know what the doctor is gonna say, right?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.920]   Some of these doctor visits have been great.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.160]   Oh yeah, he's doing fine.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.640]   Some of these doctor visits have been like,
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.480]   ooh, what's that?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.080]   We've gotta keep an eye on that.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.800]   And those things worry me.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.640]   That's a reality in my life.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.560]   I'd be lying to you if I said
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.520]   I wasn't worried about these things.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.000]   What about you, though?
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.960]   What are some of the worries,
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.440]   things that keep you up at night?
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.760]   Do you ever feel these are in danger
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.920]   of arresting your faith in Jesus?
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.280]   All right, well, I have the answer.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.800]   What do we do when we worry, right?
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.000]   Just pray more, right?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.760]   Just pray more and everything will be fine.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.560]   You just pray, ask God to take out these worries
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.800]   and take them all away,
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.400]   and then pray for blessings, riches, and pleasures.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.360]   And when you have those things,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.520]   then everything will be fine
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.320]   and your faith in God will be great.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.200]   Now, the interesting thing about this part
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.280]   is that riches and pleasures are also included
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.160]   in the list of things that can choke out
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.600]   your relationship with God.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.600]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.520]   Proponents of the prosperity of gospel
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.800]   will certainly have you believe
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.000]   that riches and pleasures are always
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.960]   what God wants to lavish on us.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.240]   And can God bless us in this way?
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.440]   And has he blessed us before in this way?
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.920]   Absolutely.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.520]   But beware, we see the problem of worry,
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.040]   but there is also the problem of pleasure.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.000]   And it works itself out in two ways.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.160]   Firstly, we might spend all our time just chasing pleasure.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.120]   That's all we ever pray about when we talk to God.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.480]   We want God to bless us, take away our troubles,
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.280]   take away our worries,
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.720]   give us the most comfortable life that we can have,
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.160]   the least amount of pain, the most amount of resources.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.560]   And we only go to God when we're seeking these things.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.440]   He becomes like an endorphin, like a pleasure machine,
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.000]   like a slot machine that we put our hope in.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.400]   Please God, give me a healing now.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.960]   Oh no, not this time, okay.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.840]   And we keep on pulling that lever,
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.600]   and when we don't get the pleasures,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.880]   our faith falls away and it doesn't grow.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.000]   Or on the other hand, some of us have these things,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.200]   we're living that life,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.160]   and our life has become so sufficient
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.480]   and so self-sustaining and resourceful,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.160]   we don't even think about God anymore.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.080]   Or everything we need, everything we have,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.160]   I can get, I have access to,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.440]   and our lives become like the rich young ruler.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.080]   Oh, I want to follow you, Jesus,
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.760]   and Jesus challenges the rich young ruler.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.200]   Well, okay, give up all your stuff,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.760]   and then you can come and follow me.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.400]   And in the end, he doesn't.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.200]   He can't take Jesus intruding into his life.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.440]   And we don't want to be the ones
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.760]   to have to sacrifice our pleasures
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.960]   in order to follow Jesus.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.920]   And the consequence is the same.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.560]   Our faith doesn't mature.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.440]   It doesn't mature because we want Jesus on our own terms.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.280]   And we're either constantly distracted by worries,
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.240]   or we're constantly distracted by the riches and pleasure.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.720]   And look, in the end, with these people,
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.800]   there isn't even a mention of faith whatsoever.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.960]   There is no faith.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.840]   Church, I pray that as a body,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.160]   as believers, as followers,
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.320]   we will not get choked out by the realities of life.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.400]   And the one thing I'm working on in this area,
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.000]   the thing I feel like keeps me grounded
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.600]   and closest to Jesus in this time
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.120]   when I'm worried about things,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.760]   or things of this life overwhelm me,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.840]   or when things get a bit too comfortable,
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.440]   is the word contentment.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.000]   Like Paul says, "I have known what it's like
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.840]   "to have little.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.160]   "I have known what it's like to have more than enough.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.520]   "But in every situation, I am content.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.360]   "I can do all things in Christ who gives me strength."
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.200]   It's like Paul saying to,
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.200]   to begging Jesus, "Jesus, please take this thorn away
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.400]   "from my flesh."
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.480]   Three times he begs, and three times Jesus says no.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   Instead he responds, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.920]   And that was enough for Paul.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.920]   Contentment is how we keep ourselves close to Jesus,
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.800]   to keep our faith nurtured,
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.280]   to keep God's word rooted in our hearts
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.920]   when we're faced with the worries
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.640]   and the pleasures of life.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.560]   Okay, no good news so far, right?
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.080]   Okay, it's been a bit heavy.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080]   I understand that.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.600]   It's coming, all right?
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.120]   These soils, because, have not allowed the seed
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.600]   to do what it was supposed to do,
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.920]   which is to grow, to mature, to take root,
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.040]   and to bear fruit.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.040]   In other words, I think what Jesus is trying to say
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.400]   is if your life and your heart represents
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.240]   soil that is hard, or is rootless, or gets choked out,
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.800]   you have not yet really, truly stepped
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.640]   into a relationship with me.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.280]   Because if you had, this is what life would be like.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.560]   This is the kind of heart, this is the kind of people
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.640]   that Jesus is looking for.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.400]   The seed on good soil stands for those
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.080]   with a noble and good heart,
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   who hear the word, retain it,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.840]   and by persevering, produce a crop.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.480]   Notice how God defines noble and good.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.360]   People who hear and retain are noble and good.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.560]   This is what happens when seed meets good soil.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.400]   These people don't have hard hearts.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.280]   They have hearts that are noble and good.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.320]   These are the kind of hearts that don't fall away,
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.000]   or don't get choked out by worries and pleasure,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.520]   because they persevere.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.360]   This is the kind of heart, when the seed meets the soil,
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.720]   the seed is able to fulfill its potential
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.680]   to do what it's meant to do, and to produce a crop,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.480]   to bear fruit.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.440]   This is the point of discipleship.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.320]   This is the aim of following Jesus with your life.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.320]   True discipleship, a true sign of whether or not
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.560]   you really have a heart that follows Jesus,
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.120]   is to see whether or not you have fruit to show for it.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:18.200]   But the key word here is this, perseverance is the key.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.320]   Because crop, fruit, doesn't just pop up overnight.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.720]   Those chia pets, as gimmicky as they are,
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.000]   takes time to grow.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.040]   The only way this crop grows, the only way the fruit comes,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.160]   is through time, is through persevering.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.520]   In other words, it's not that the enemy hasn't maybe tried
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.320]   to snatch the seed away.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.120]   It's not that the good seed and the good soil
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.200]   is free from testing and temptations.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.120]   It's not that the seed is free from worries,
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:50.000]   of riches and pleasures, and everything that comes with life.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.760]   This soil probably had to deal with
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.480]   all these things as well.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.240]   But the key difference is, is that they persevere.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.040]   They don't give up.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.920]   It requires a lifetime of response to consider
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.160]   what one's soul looks like to a slowly developing crop.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.360]   Fruit does not appear overnight.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.040]   Neither does the harvest of our heart.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.280]   Which is why the Bible tells us time and time again,
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.440]   be strong and courageous, endure.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.800]   It is the one who endures to the end who will be saved.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.240]   We will reap what we sow when we don't give up.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:33.600]   Run with endurance the race that is set before you, church.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.840]   A fruitful life looks like a life alive with faith.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.000]   That's when we see the crop.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.960]   That's when we see the fruit of a heart
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.680]   that has God's word taken root in it.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.240]   So again, what does this look like?
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.760]   Luke actually gives us some examples.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.560]   Just as he gave examples of people
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.120]   that didn't listen to the word of God
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.360]   and didn't take in their hearts,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.840]   there are good examples of this too.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.600]   So a fruitful life looks like the woman
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.560]   who were with Jesus at the beginning of our story.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.720]   When I began reading this message,
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.560]   I began in Luke 8, verse one intentionally
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.680]   because it describes a group of women
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.440]   whom Jesus had healed, cast out demons, healed from diseases.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.880]   And but look what their response is.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.160]   Luke tells us that Jesus helped these women.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.600]   He had healed them, but now their response was
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.960]   these women were helping to support Jesus' ministry
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.720]   out of their own means.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.120]   They didn't let their resources,
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.240]   they didn't let the pleasures and the comfort
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.040]   that came with what they had stop their faith in Jesus.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.000]   Rather, they used it to serve him and his ministry.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.560]   Luke shares the story of the Roman centurion
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.880]   who had so much faith, he told Jesus,
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.120]   "You don't need to come to my house.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   "I'm not worthy of you coming to my house
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.460]   "for you to heal my servant,
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.080]   "but just say the word and my servant will be healed."
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.480]   That's what fruit looks like.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.840]   The faith on display is the sinful woman
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   who broke open, perfumed the most precious thing she had
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.620]   in order to honor and anoint Jesus' feet.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.960]   A faith on display is John the Baptist
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.560]   living a life in the desert, eating locusts and honey.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.080]   People thought he was crazy, people thought he was mad,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.860]   but he dedicated his life to proclaiming the word of God,
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.140]   to prepare the way of the coming of the Messiah.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.860]   That was what his life mission was about
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.500]   and nothing could stop him from doing that.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:37.820]   And so here's the surprising end of this passage.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.140]   Actually, it's not a coincidence
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:43.020]   that Jesus' teaching about a lamp on the stand
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.900]   actually comes at the end of this parable.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.080]   Because the lamp on the stand
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.380]   is actually another mini parable,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.740]   Jesus trying to explain what he has just said.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.560]   A lamp is meant to what?
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.580]   Shed light and not be hidden.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.940]   A seed is meant to bear fruit
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.420]   and not to be snatched up or growthless.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:07.620]   A follower of Jesus is meant to live a life of faith,
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.960]   rooted in the word of God
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.340]   and then inspires others to do the same.
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.540]   Church, if you have ears today, then we need to hear.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.520]   What kind of soil do we want to be?
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.740]   You know, as I was thinking about this,
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.500]   it brought me all the way back to Genesis
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.540]   and it sounds like Andrew, I know, okay,
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.660]   but it brought me back to Genesis.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.700]   Because when God created human beings,
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.300]   how did he create us?
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.040]   He created us from the soil.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.300]   God formed us out of the soil
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.660]   and breathed his life into us.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.100]   God created you to be that soil,
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.340]   to be that soil where once his word is planted in you,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.740]   would take root and bear fruit,
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.780]   to make a difference in this world,
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.700]   to make a difference in your life.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.620]   Because we have a world out there
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.220]   that is starving and hungry
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.820]   and they need to know who they are
[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.740]   and who God sees them and how much God loves them.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.740]   And without seed that bears fruit,
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.080]   this whole world is gonna be hungry and die without him.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:22.580]   And that's not the world we want to see.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.180]   That's not the society we want to build.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.780]   That's not what God's kingdom looks like.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.620]   God's kingdom is about bearing fruit
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:30.820]   and fruit that bears even more fruit,
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.140]   a thousandfold, a hundredfold.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.940]   Church, what kind of soil do we want to be?
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:43.160]   May we be the kind of soil that God's word can take root
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:48.340]   and grow and bear fruit for ourselves, for our lives,
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.220]   for this city and for the world
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.860]   that so desperately needs him.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.340]   Would you pray with me?
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:09.660]   Now as a community, as a body of Christ here,
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.020]   we talk about our vision for ourselves,
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.900]   the vision that we feel like God's given to us
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.780]   is to grow big people.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.380]   Like we've been talking about,
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:23.040]   in order for growth to happen,
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.220]   God's word has to first of all take root.
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.940]   And so maybe right now it's just a time
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.940]   just to quieten down and think about,
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.540]   has your heart been hardened?
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.900]   Are you sitting here maybe with a hard heart right now
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.340]   and there's lots of reasons for that,
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.660]   but you feel like I've heard God's word before,
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.260]   I just can't bring myself to believe in it.
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:53.420]   I pray that today that that hardness would be broken
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.380]   and that you would allow God's word to,
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.980]   the seed to take plant in your heart
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.460]   and begin to take root.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.900]   For some of us, we have testings
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.780]   and we've been through a lot and we're going through a lot
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.700]   and we're at the verge of giving up,
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.260]   like I can't take anymore, if I'm tested,
[00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.340]   if there's one more thing that comes up,
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.060]   I don't know where I'm gonna be.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:30.100]   Take heart, trust in the Lord.
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.340]   His word is faithful and it's true
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.700]   and he will, he is with you,
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.980]   he is walking beside you,
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.420]   he is using those things for your good
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.740]   and for the glory of his purposes.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:47.900]   Maybe for some of us, we are worried about life
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.020]   or we've been so caught up with the good things
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.940]   that life has presented us with
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.980]   that we've barely given a thought to the Lord recently.
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.940]   Again, come back to the Lord.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.020]   Don't let those things distract you
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.860]   but keep your eyes focused.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:12.460]   Speak contentment over yourself,
[00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:17.460]   knowing that with Jesus, we have more than enough
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.620]   so that we can bear fruit,
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.620]   we can be that good soil that Jesus talks about at the end.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.100]   And for those of us who are there,
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:29.660]   who want to get there,
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.340]   our prayer is to persevere, to press on,
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.700]   to endure, to push through
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:40.740]   so that we can see God's faithfulness in the end.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.460]   Give him the praise, give him the glory,
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.500]   live our lives for him and inspire others to do the same.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.300]   So Jesus, may you make us the good soil
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.300]   that you've called us to be.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:58.140]   May your word take root and bear fruit in our lives
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.540]   as individuals, as family, as a community,
[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.340]   as your church here in this city.
[00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.740]   We pray in your name, Lord.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.580]   Amen.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.180]   (gentle music)
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.780]   (gentle music)
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.360]   (gentle music)
