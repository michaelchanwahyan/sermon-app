1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Church, once again, it's good to see this room filled.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 My name is Justin, one of the pastors here, and I just want to, on behalf of the church,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 welcome everyone, especially if you're tuning in for the very first time.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 This is your first time. Welcome.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Likewise for everyone here, if you came with a friend, if you're curious, you came.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 If for a miraculous reason you're here, we're glad you're here.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I want to give a special shout out to our youth. Flight is here.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I know you guys are all around.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And so every Sunday, Flight joins us for service, so it's awesome to have you guys with us.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Yeah, so I just want to welcome everyone.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And can I see a show of hands if you were here last week,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 whether you're watching online or you tuned in, were you guys here?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Can I see you? Higher, higher. Yeah, don't be shy.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 All right, that's almost everyone.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Hey, Pastor Andrew's going to speak into this, but I just want to say last Sunday was beautiful.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Now, it might have been a bit hard at the beginning. What? Like pray for people?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But actually, you know what? This is what church is supposed to be.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 This is the normal Christian life.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 So if you missed last Sunday, I want to encourage you to go back last week,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 and you can re-listen to Pastor Andrew's message, but also just watch till the end,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 because what we did together, what we experienced is the norm.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And it is our prayer that together we can build and rebuild a culture out of the fifth wave

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 so that we can live out what we read in the Bible. Amen?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Okay, so if you're new here, this is the church that we want to continue to be.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And for everyone else, if you are curious, if you have questions,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 there's many ways that you can connect with us.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 You can email us, info@divine.org. We'll answer you.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 The best way, I always say this, is to ask the person sitting beside you.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 If you have questions, if you want to know, we are a big church.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 If you have questions, you want to get involved, you want to know our history,

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 maybe they can--I hope you guys can share enough, you know, that will get our new friends curious.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But also, we have a Connect Hub outside.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 We are there just to connect you. If you want to get involved, if you want to serve,

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 then please stick around.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 And today, you know, in the last while, we've been exiting through the fire escape.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And I just want to say that last Sunday was the last time you'll ever do that.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So we want to just remind you not to rush.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 We don't actually want you to rush out of here.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Even if you have plans, we don't want you to rush out.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 But basically today, we're all going to exit the church the same way you came up.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And one of the reasons why is we want you just to stick around.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 We want you to chat.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Because sometimes, like, leaving through the fire escape just feels like we need to leave immediately.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And we want to change that once again. We're trying to change our culture.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And so I think that is--oh, yes, and also serving.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 You know, in the last few weeks, we've been asking you if for those of you who are looking for a place to serve,

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 we actually have many opportunities throughout the service and also throughout the week.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But going back to what I was just saying, you know, like we're trying to just live out the word together.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 We're trying to just regather what it is to be a Christian.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 You know, actually to be served, I think all of us need to serve.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 All of us can't just receive and receive.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 We actually need outlets to give.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And so I just want to ask each of you, if you call the Vine your home church, just to discern how you are to serve.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We're not asking you to all serve at the church, right?

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 But actually I want to ask you to serve--how do you want to serve at work?

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 How do you want to serve in your home place?

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 How do you want to serve with your energy and the resources, everything that's given to you?

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And it takes discernment.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 But for those of you who want to serve at the Vine, once again, just scan the QR code and you can continue to figure that out.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I'm going to invite Pastor Andrew, and we're going to pray together.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Good morning, everyone. How are you guys doing?

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Everybody okay?

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So I think many of us in this room will recognize and know that yesterday, June 4th, was an important date in Hong Kong and China's shared history.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And here at the Vine, you know, we've always wanted to be a church that responds pastorally in moments and events that take place in our city.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 We're a church that's called to be on behalf of the city.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And so when our city is going through something, we always want to be a pastoral response.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And so what we're going to do today is I wanted to create some space in our service to pray for you to have some chance to reflect.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 I'm going to create some space in the prayer time for you to be able to bring your own prayers.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 We're going to have a time of silence together where you can bring your own reflection and prayer.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And then I'm going to finish this time in praying a blessing both over Hong Kong and also over China as we move forward in a shared history together.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So I wonder whether you would just bow your heads with me, close your eyes, and let us pray.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Dear Lord Jesus, we come as a community to you this morning as we reflect on the tragic and heartbreaking events of 33 years ago.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 We invite you to come now and to minister to us through both scripture and prayer.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Psalm 86 says, "Hear us, Lord, and answer us, for you guard our lives and you have mercy on us.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 For you, Lord, are forgiving and good. You abound in love to all who call on you."

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So we come today and we call on you to meet us in this time of reflection and prayer.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 We acknowledge the many feelings that are in this room and in our city at this time.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Those who are grieving, mourning, remembering, feeling forgotten or unheard.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 We ask, Lord, that you would be present with them in this time.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 That you would be merciful to them, helping them to know your love and your goodness.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Lord, we also pray for any in Hong Kong this weekend who are in need of peace.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 We recognize our call to be peacemakers as children of God.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And so today we pray for this peace.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 That as his church we would be a pastoral presence for any in our city who face trauma, tragedy or struggle.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 Psalm 86 also says, "But you, Lord, are compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Show us your strength on behalf of your servants."

87
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So Father, we ask today for your strength in this time.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 We ask for your compassion, your grace and your faithfulness to be found in us.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 So that we may be strong as your servants to any in our society who are in need of care in this time.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 We will now have a time of silence for you to be able to bring your own reflections and prayers at this time.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 [Silence]

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Father, we give you these prayers of ours and we lay them down at your feet as an offering before you.

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 We thank you that you hear each and every one of them.

94
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And that you always respond to the prayers of your people.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 We finish our time of prayer by asking for a blessing to come to our city of Hong Kong and to the broader nation of China.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 We know that there are many lords still in China that are in need of the gospel.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 We pray for a blessing to be on the church in China to be able to rise up and share and be your hands and feet in this time.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 We also recognize the many in Hong Kong who still also need to hear of Jesus.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Lord, we pray that your church in this city would also be strong.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 That we would be able to proclaim the gospel in Hong Kong and in China in our shared history as we move forward together.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

102
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Everyone says? Amen.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Thank you guys so much for praying. That's so important for us just to take that time.

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 You know, today, June 5th, is also a very important day in the diary because it's Justin Ho's birthday today.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Like, yeah, yeah, I know.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So can we sing happy birthday?

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Happy birthday to you.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Happy birthday to you.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Happy birthday dear Justin.

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Happy birthday to you. Yay!

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Alright, I'm going to pray for you Justin.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 40 years old today. 40 years young!

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 I know!

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Justin reminded me earlier that he served here at the Vine.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 We've served alongside each other since he was 29.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So it's been a wonderful time and I know that there will be many years ahead.

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Let me pray for you my friend.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Father, we thank you for birthdays and we thank you for this man and for his faithfulness to this city.

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 His faithfulness to this congregation, this people.

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 His faithfulness to us as a leadership and on leadership here at the Vine.

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So I just want to pray a blessing for him, for Patsy, for the kids.

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 You'd fill him today as he celebrates this day of his birth.

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 And we just thank you for this in your name.

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Amen. Amen.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Thank you. That was not expected.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I'm ready to go guys now.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Actually, I have a few more announcements and then we're going to take up our offering.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And Pastor Andrew is going to come and give today's word for us.

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 And so just a few things.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 For June 12th, next Sunday, two important things are going to happen.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 One is our EGM where we're going to hopefully, for us voting members,

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 we're going to vote in our new elder, Sky Sue.

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And so that's going to be exciting.

134
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 So if you want to join, please, you can just fill out a form and you can actually be able to vote Sky in.

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And another thing is going to happen starting next Sunday.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Are you ready for this?

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 We are going to downsize our services a little.

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Rather than having four services, we're going to have three services.

139
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 We're going to have the 9, 15, 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And we've realized recently, we've discerned and we've seen that we just have lower numbers in the 2 p.m. services.

141
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 And therefore, it just kind of makes sense to consolidate, put together the 2 and the 4 p.m.

142
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And once, you know, we'll see how things go and we'll announce once again when we have four services.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But starting next Sunday, we're going to have 9, 15, 11 and 2.

144
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Is that okay?

145
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 But for those of you watching online, continue to join us at 11 a.m.

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I think that's right. Yes.

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 All right.

148
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And, you know, I think in the last while, all of us have postponed a lot of things, especially I think a lot of us getting married.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 You know, last year has been difficult.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I know there's a lot more weddings.

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And another thing that we had to postpone since last month and it's been a long while is our flight relaunch, which is happening today in Wan Chai Park at 1 p.m.

152
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And so if you are a teenager, you want to check out flight.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 If you are a parent of a teenager, if you're a parent of a teen to be, if you want to serve our teens, if you want to serve at flight,

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 today is actually a really great opportunity to meet Pastor Grace, to meet our other youth and parents.

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And that's happening after service, 1 p.m.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And Grace, can you just say hi?

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Can you stand up just to say hi?

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 This is Pastor Grace.

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And she did say at any time, go back, you know, go to her.

160
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And if you see her here, go and say hi.

161
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 She would love to answer any questions you have about flight and what she does and who she is.

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And, yeah, so we welcome that.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 The last announcement is very important is this Tuesday, we are going to have an all-church prayer meeting.

164
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 We haven't had this in a long while.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 And this is one of our first ones.

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And we are going to have it both physical and online.

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 So we would just basically love to see everyone there.

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 We're going to pray for our church plant.

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 We're going to pray for the next year as Pastor Tim and Pastor Ivan.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And the many of you who are going to volunteer, we want to hear God together.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 We want to lean in and see what he is saying to us as we prepare this year.

172
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So it's going to be 730 here in the auditorium until 930 and also 730 online.

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So please, please do join us.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Please clear out your schedule.

175
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 We would love to see you guys there.

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And I think just with this church meeting, this prayer meeting, as well as offering that we're about to take,

177
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I just want to say once again, last week is announced how much you have given, you know, how much we've raised on Vision Sunday.

178
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Our goal target was 5.8 and we have 6.3, right?

179
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So Pastor Tim, Pastor Ivan and the whole team will have a whole year where they can just focus on discipleship building.

180
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 They can just pray.

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 They can actually have that space to not worry about finances.

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And so, but this comes out of your generosity.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 This is a miracle.

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Like I keep on telling people in the last two weeks, like this is crazy.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 And we've had the lowest numbers.

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Well, we had pretty low numbers.

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Like we had like 800, 900 people for that Sunday.

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But yet God, through your generosity, really just, yeah, just helped us.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So church, I want to pray as we give, as we continue just to really discern how God wants us to give,

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 whether through a church plant, whether through your own lives.

191
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 So church, would you pray with me?

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And afterwards, Pastor Andrew is going to come up.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Father, we give you our lives again.

194
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 We surrender the things that you've given us.

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 We also surrender our energy and the things that we hope to give, Lord God.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 We pray that you would show each of us how to be generous like you, how to continue to lay down our life to serve,

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 how to continue to emulate your son, Jesus, in our lives and reflect that so that the world may know that there is a God,

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 that there is grace, that is redemption, and that there is a church who longs to just share the good news.

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And so, Father, would you be glorified through our giving.

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 In your name we pray. Amen.

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Amen. Can we thank Justin for all that he is, all that he does?

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Amazing. You can have your Bible.

203
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So last week, hey, by the way, how are you?

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Everybody okay?

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 All right. Last week I said to you that I wanted to introduce you to two of the most important and influential people in the New Testament

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 and help you to understand how their story has significantly shaped your own.

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And I said last week that the interesting thing about these two people is they are probably people that you're not very familiar with.

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And that says something quite beautiful about who God is.

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Our God is a God who loves to use people to change history that so often the world very quickly forgets about.

210
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It's these small people, if you will, that God so often uses for his greatest glory.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 I said last week that large doors so often swing on small little hinges.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And every single person in this room is a small hinge, if you will, for Jesus.

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 And there's so much that he wants to do in and through us.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So last week I introduced you to the first of these characters.

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I introduced you to Ananias.

216
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Ananias, a person that's only mentioned once, not really mentioned again.

217
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 A person who wasn't particularly powerful or had a big name.

218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 But someone God chose to go to a house in Damascus, lay his hands on a man called Saul, pray for him,

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 see a miracle take place where he goes from blindness to receive sight.

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And Saul is transformed into Paul.

221
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And Ananias gets to do this.

222
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 And I said last week that every single one of us in this room is an Ananias.

223
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 That the same spirit that was on Ananias in that moment sits and lives inside of us.

224
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 That our great call is to also lay hands on one another, speak truth over each other,

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 pray for each other and believe that by the Spirit of God we would come alive together.

226
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And last week as we did that, as I asked you to do that at every single service here,

227
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 it was unbelievable what God did.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I mean honestly it was one of my most favorite Sundays that we've had here.

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 I know you're not supposed to have a favorite Sunday, but it's like one of my favorite Sundays for years and years and years.

230
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 As I saw everybody across our four services pray for people.

231
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Like not us pray for you, you pray for you.

232
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And the power of the Spirit in the room doing that was so amazing.

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 We got emails in this week from people who were testifying about healings that they'd experienced,

234
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 testifying about salvation.

235
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Some people had shared with some people and they didn't know Jesus or they hadn't given their lives to Jesus

236
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 and salvation took place during that time.

237
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And one gentleman reached out to me and he said, "I'm a Korean and I come to the Vine

238
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 and I didn't know there were any other Koreans here.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And I was a little bit nervous about praying for people because my English and my Cantonese is not very good.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And the guy sitting next to me was a Korean.

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And so we chatted in Korean and prayed together."

242
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And I'm like, "That's awesome."

243
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 There are quite a lot of Koreans in our church, I just want to say.

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 There are.

245
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 But anyway, so that was awesome.

246
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 That was great.

247
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 There was lots of testimonies like that.

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And here's the thing that I wanted to say.

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 As excited as we were about last week,

250
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 my heart is and my sense is that that was just the tip of the iceberg about what God wants to do amongst us.

251
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 That there's actually so much more by the Spirit of God that He wants to do in a church

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 that genuinely spiritually cares for each other.

253
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 And what we're going to do, you know, we're not going to force you to do that every week.

254
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 I kind of forced you to do it last week because it was part of being in Ananias.

255
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 But we're not going to do that every week.

256
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 But we want to kind of put a culture in here at the Vine

257
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 that when you come in on a Sunday, your expectation, your thinking is not,

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 "I'm coming in to sit in a chair, to sing some songs, to receive a message and then leave."

259
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 No, your thinking is, "I'm coming into church because I have something spiritually to contribute

260
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 to the lives of the people around me.

261
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 That I want to actually draw around them and I want to be used by God to speak into someone's life."

262
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Because guess what?

263
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I want someone to speak into my life.

264
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 I need someone to come and lay their hands on me and pray for me.

265
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And wouldn't it be amazing if every week at the Vine,

266
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 we just paused to look at our neighbors and kind of take the courage to say,

267
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 "Is there some way I can pray for you?"

268
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 And so what we saw last week, we're believing.

269
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 We're not going to mandate it.

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 We're not going to force you to do it.

271
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 But I'm just believing as the Spirit of God stirs inside of us,

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 you're going to have a hunger to say, "I want more of that."

273
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And guess what?

274
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 The power, the Spirit sits in you.

275
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And what I loved about last week is so many of you were able to do this.

276
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 You were able to take a circumstance and a situation from somebody

277
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 and connect it to something that God was doing in their life.

278
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And you were able to pray into that connection of a circumstance,

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 a situation in the world, and God and His kingdom and the Spirit.

280
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And bringing the world and the kingdom together is exactly what today is all about.

281
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I want to introduce you to the second of these characters

282
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 that have literally changed the world and changed how we think about church.

283
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And again, it's somebody that you're probably not very familiar with.

284
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And like last week, where that story of that individual, Ananias,

285
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 sat within a bigger narrative of a more famous Christian, Paul.

286
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 So today's hero, their story, her story,

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 sits within the larger narrative of another famous disciple in the New Testament,

288
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 that of Peter.

289
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And in this story, we see Peter at a moment of his life

290
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 that was the most tragic and most difficult.

291
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Peter had some pretty big tragedies and some pretty difficult moments in his life,

292
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 throughout his life.

293
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 He was one of those guys who sometimes had it right and sometimes had it wrong,

294
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 who kind of opened his mouth and put his foot in it

295
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 and sometimes said great things and sometimes said really weird things.

296
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 That was kind of Peter's journey with Jesus.

297
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Like, "Who are you, Lord?"

298
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Then it was like, "You're the Son of God."

299
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Then it was like, "I deny you. I don't know who you are."

300
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Then it's distraught, back fishing.

301
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Then God meets him with a fire on the beach

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 and has breakfast with him in the resurrection.

303
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And then Peter is filled again with forgiveness

304
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 and he becomes the central rock of the early church.

305
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 He stands before the Sanhedrin and he preaches the gospel.

306
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 He's flogged and he's beaten for it.

307
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 But he says, "I'm counted worthy of being persecuted for the gospel."

308
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And then at this time in the story, he's arrested.

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And he's placed in prison.

310
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And he's literally days away from his execution.

311
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I mean, this is about as hard as it gets for Peter.

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And the question the passage asks is,

313
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 "Is anyone going to be able to help this man?

314
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Is anyone going to be able to save him?"

315
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 And large doors swing on very small hinges.

316
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 I want to introduce you today to another small hinge

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 who's going to blow your mind.

318
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 This story is found in Acts chapter 12.

319
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's perhaps my favorite story in the whole of Acts.

320
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And I said exactly that about Acts 9 last week.

321
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 But I'm allowed to change my mind every week, okay?

322
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 This is my favorite story in all of Acts.

323
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I love this one.

324
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 All right, Acts 12 verse 1. Are you ready?

325
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Okay.

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 "It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church,

327
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 intending to persecute them.

328
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.

329
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 When he saw that this pleased the Jews,

330
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 he proceeded to seize Peter also.

331
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

332
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 After arresting him, he put him in prison,

333
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each.

334
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover."

335
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 So I tell you each week that Luke is a master storyteller.

336
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And each week as I'm preaching out of the Scriptures,

337
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 I want to model for you what Bible study is like,

338
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 how you can approach the Scriptures for yourself.

339
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 And each week I say that the opening part of a passage

340
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 is often the most critical to understand the broader narrative

341
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 that's important for your interpretation of what happens.

342
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And here we see the exact same thing happening.

343
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 So first of all, Luke, the storyteller, he tells us about Herod.

344
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Now this is the different, this is not the same Herod

345
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 as the Herod that was there at Jesus' birth,

346
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 the one who ordered the genocide of all the children under two

347
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 in and around Bethlehem.

348
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 This is actually, that's Herod's grandson,

349
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 who's also called Herod, which is a bit confusing,

350
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 but it's his grandson.

351
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And this Herod's interesting because he's Roman,

352
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 but history tells us that he actually had some Jewish ancestry in him.

353
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 So he was part Roman and part Jewish,

354
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and in a way the perfect person to govern Judea at this time.

355
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 But because he was part Jewish, he had a certain tendency

356
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 to want to please the Jews in the area that he was serving.

357
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And so he had arrested James.

358
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Now this is not James, the brother of Jesus.

359
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 This is James, who's the son of Zebedee, one of the 12.

360
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And this James is arrested by Herod, and Herod puts him to death.

361
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 It literally says here he was killed by the sword.

362
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Now that should make you stop and think,

363
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 because Roman governors, when they wanted to kill someone,

364
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 their execution was on a cross, like what happened with Jesus.

365
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Crucifixion wasn't just for Jesus.

366
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 It was the general way that the Romans kill people.

367
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 But here in the text, this Roman governor doesn't use a crucifixion for James.

368
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 He uses the sword.

369
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Now the reason is, is because in the Jewish law of the first century,

370
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 in the midrash, if somebody was an apostate,

371
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 they were allowed to be killed by stoning or by the sword.

372
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And what Herod does in killing this James by the sword,

373
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 he's sending a message to all of the Jewish people in the area.

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And he's saying, "I agree with you. Christianity is wrong.

375
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 I agree with you. We don't believe Jesus is the Messiah.

376
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 And anybody who does is an apostate.

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And watch, I kill him with the sword to confirm to you

378
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 that I agree that Christianity is wrong."

379
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Now this pleased the Jews, so much so that Herod's on a roll.

380
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 So he's like, "Well, who else can I arrest?"

381
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 "Well, I'm going to arrest the most famous church leader in that moment.

382
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 That was Peter."

383
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Now Paul, we saw last week, has already had his conversion experience,

384
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 but Paul's not yet released yet to be a leader in the church,

385
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 into the Greek and Roman Empire.

386
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Peter is the central leader at this time.

387
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And so Herod doubles down. He arrests Peter.

388
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Now it says here that he arrests him during the week

389
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 of the festival of the unleavened bread.

390
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 This is the same week that Jesus was arrested.

391
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It's the week of the celebration of the Passover.

392
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 It's the week when they actually celebrated their release by Egypt

393
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 from slavery by God's power into the promised land.

394
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 It's a whole week that is to celebrate that God can liberate his people.

395
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And the irony of this story is Peter is arrested at the very week

396
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 when they're celebrating liberation.

397
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Peter is incarcerated during the festival of liberation.

398
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And it's explained that way to help us to begin to kind of go,

399
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "Oh, that doesn't seem right.

400
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 There's something odd going on in this story right here."

401
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And the final thing Luke introduces us to is how Peter is guarded.

402
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 He's not just guarded by one guard outside behind some locked doors.

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 He is actually chained by two guards.

404
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 So two guards are literally chained to his ankles.

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And then there are two other guards that are outside.

406
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And these four guards rotate all the time so that there is 24-hour surveillance of Peter.

407
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 They do this because they believe that he's a flight risk,

408
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 that he's going to try to escape, which is ironic because that's about to happen, right?

409
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But in this moment, they're like, "We're not sure if he's going to stick around.

410
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 So we're going to make sure he does by chaining him literally to these guards

411
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 and setting this all up."

412
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 So everything is designed in the story right here for you to lean into it and go,

413
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 "What's going to happen next?

414
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 Is there any hope at all for Peter?"

415
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Verse 5 says this,

416
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 "So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him."

417
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I love this. Luke says you need to understand that there was hope in this situation.

418
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 That although Peter was in prison, the church was gathered praying for him.

419
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 The church was gathered praying for him, believing that their prayers mattered,

420
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 believing that prayer could change Peter's situation.

421
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Although he might be incarcerated during the festival of liberation,

422
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 but don't give up hope.

423
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 The church is alive. The church is on its knees.

424
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 The church is praying for him.

425
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And there's this exciting sense that the church is doing that.

426
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 You need to know that there's power in a gathered church praying,

427
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 and that's exactly what we're going to do on Tuesday evening at 7.30.

428
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I know, I know. None of you were planning to be there,

429
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 but this is important. 7.30 in this room or online,

430
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 when a church prays, something changes in the atmosphere.

431
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 God does something. He listens to the cries of his people.

432
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 When his church is on its knees pleading, God responds.

433
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Luke describes it as a church earnestly praying for Peter.

434
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 The word "earnestly" there is the exact same word that Luke uses for Jesus

435
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 when he's praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.

436
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Remember that moment where Jesus is crying out,

437
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 "Lord, if there's any other way, take the cross from me,

438
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 but your will be done, not my will."

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 And he's so anxious that he's literally sweating blood.

440
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Luke takes that same word and he says,

441
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 "That's what it was like for this church.

442
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 They were gathered on their knees."

443
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 The word in Greek means to stretch forth.

444
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 They were stretching forth like Jesus was,

445
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 and they were probably praying,

446
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 "God, release Peter from prison. Release him from the chains,

447
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 but not our will, but your will be done.

448
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 But if there's any way for him to be released,

449
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 would you bring him back to us? Release him.

450
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 We don't want him to die." They're stretching out.

451
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 Here's the other crazy thing.

452
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 The festival of unliving bread lasted for seven days,

453
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and Herod could not do a trial until the whole thing was finished.

454
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 So for seven days, the church is crying out.

455
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Can you see a church of faith crying out,

456
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 believing that they could change the scenario of Peter's life

457
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 by stretching forth like in the Garden of Gethsemane?

458
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Oh, man, does our city need a few churches like that?

459
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 I wonder whether we might rise up in this time

460
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 of Hong Kong's great need,

461
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 in this time of such change in our city,

462
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 that we would be willing to get our knees dirty,

463
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 stretch forth, and really pray 7.30 on Tuesday night.

464
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 That's the last time I'm mentioning it, okay?

465
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 But I look forward to seeing everybody there.

466
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Does the prayer make a difference? Let's have a look.

467
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 This whole sermon is not a plug for Tuesday night, I promise.

468
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Verse 6 onwards.

469
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 "The night before Herod was to bring him to trial,

470
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains,

471
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 and centuries stood guard at the entrance.

472
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell.

473
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 He struck Peter on the side and woke him up.

474
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 'Quickly, get up,' he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists."

475
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I love this moment. Oh, my goodness, this is so good.

476
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Can you imagine if you were this angel?

477
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 This is your moment.

478
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Like you've been an angel all your life.

479
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Like you've always wanted to be used by God

480
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 for a powerful encounter in the world.

481
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And God has come and tapped you on the shoulder.

482
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Let's call him Angel Bob.

483
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 God's come and tapped him on the shoulder and said,

484
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 'Angel Bob, this is your moment.

485
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I'm sending you down into a jail cell where Peter is,

486
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 and you're going to show up, and light's going to shine all around,

487
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 and it's going to be this magic moment,

488
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 and you're going to release Peter from prison.'

489
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And you can imagine this angel, 'Wow, this is the best moment of my life.'

490
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And Luke says, 'Peter's sleeping, like passed out.

491
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Like not just sleeping, sleeping so much that when the angel shows up,

492
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 he has to strike him on his side to wake him up.'

493
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 This is the night before Peter should have gone to trial.

494
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 The night before he's being sentenced to death,

495
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Peter's just like, 'I don't know about you,

496
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 but I would be pacing around praying or doing something.'

497
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Put yourself in the--I don't know if angels wore sandals--

498
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 put yourself in the sandals of this angel for a moment.

499
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Imagine this. He's getting ready, right?

500
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And this is the moment. There's Peter.

501
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 He's like, 'Ahhhh!'

502
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 You know, like suddenly showing up, right?

503
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 Peter's like, 'Ahhhh!'

504
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 The angel's like, 'Well, that didn't quite go to plan.

505
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 All right, I'm going to turn it up to 11 on the notch here.

506
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 We're going to do this again. Ahhh!'

507
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 The light flashes around, and he's completely oblivious to it.

508
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And so the angel goes up to him and said,

509
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 'Hey, come on, let's go. Hey, you, don't wake the guards.

510
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Come on, you. Yes, you.

511
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Wait, why are you not waking? You're not--'

512
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And he kicks him in the stomach.

513
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Literally, the Greek word means.

514
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 He strikes him in the stomach.

515
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 You can imagine Peter going like, 'Ooooh!' like this.

516
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Suddenly waking out of his deep sleep and seeing an angel.

517
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 It's described here that he thinks he's seeing a vision.

518
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 He doesn't really know that this is happening in reality,

519
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 but the chains fall off his wrist.

520
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Notice what happens next.

521
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Verse 8 onwards.

522
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 'Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and your sandals."

523
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And Peter did so.

524
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."

525
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And the angel told him.

526
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 So Peter followed him out of the prison,

527
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 but he had no idea what the angel was doing was really happening.

528
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 He thought he was seeing a vision.

529
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 'They passed the first and the second guards

530
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 and then came to the iron gate leading to the city.

531
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 It opened for them by itself and they went through it.

532
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 When they had walked the length of one street,

533
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 suddenly the angel left him.'

534
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Don't know how that happened, but the angel just left.

535
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 'Then Peter came to himself in that moment and said,

536
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel

537
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 and rescued me from Herod's clutches

538
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating."'

539
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 The angel leads him past one set of guards,

540
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 past the second set of guards,

541
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 and then they come to this thing called the iron gate.

542
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 Now the iron gate was really important.

543
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 This is the main prison in Jerusalem.

544
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 The iron gate was a big, heavy, solid gate

545
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 that had one purpose in mind.

546
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 That was to keep the people who were in prison, in prison,

547
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 and keep the people who were in the city out of the prison.

548
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 It was the gateway between those that were incarcerated

549
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 to the freedom that was seen in the city.

550
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 This has significant metaphorical punch to the story, this iron gate.

551
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 And this iron gate, as Peter gets to it, opens up by itself,

552
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 miraculously by itself, so that Peter can walk straight through it.

553
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And when he gets one length of a street, the angel disappears

554
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and he has this 'aha' moment.

555
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 He's like, 'Wow, this really just did happen.'

556
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And Peter says these incredible words.

557
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 He says, 'I know now that God has sent an angel

558
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 to deliver me from Herod's clutches.'

559
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 The word 'clutches' there is a word that's found predominantly

560
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 in the Exodus narrative, where God releases by the Passover,

561
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Israel to be able to get out from Egypt's slavery.

562
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 It's the word that was used a lot during the festival of unleavened bread.

563
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 And Peter makes the connection in his freedom.

564
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 He's like, 'I've experienced liberation.

565
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 I've experienced a new Exodus.

566
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I am now out of the clutches of Herod, and I am free.'

567
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I think for Peter, the opening of the iron gate was his Red Sea parting moment.

568
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 That moment in the Exodus story where the sea parted,

569
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 so they could get through and get away and go to safety.

570
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 So the iron gate opening by itself was like the waters of the Red Sea passing,

571
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 and now Peter is free.

572
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And he's standing on the street, and he's like, 'I'm free!'

573
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 But then something dawns on him.

574
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 He might be out of prison, but he's not yet out of danger.

575
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And he knows that probably at any moment now, the guards are going to wake up.

576
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 The guards are going to work out what's happened.

577
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Any moment now, they're going to start running after him.

578
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 And he suddenly starts to panic, and he thinks, 'Well, what do I do?

579
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Where do I go? Where is safe for me? Where do I move to safety?'

580
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And he decides, 'Oh, there's that church, isn't there, that meets in Mary's house.'

581
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 He's got no idea that they're meeting, they're praying for him,

582
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 but he decides he's going to go to Mary's house, because that's a safe place.

583
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 I want you to see what happens next in the story.

584
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 Verse 12, "When this all dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary,

585
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying."

586
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 This is where our small hinge comes into the story.

587
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 "Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door.

588
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she ran back in without opening it,

589
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 and exclaimed, 'Peter's at the door!'"

590
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Oh my goodness.

591
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 Let me tell you a little bit about the small hinge called Rhoda.

592
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Rhoda is a Greek name.

593
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 We don't know much about her in this story, but her name is Greek.

594
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 It actually in the Greek means rose.

595
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 So perhaps she was a young girl.

596
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Perhaps she was kind of fragile and sort of peaceful like a rose.

597
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 What we do know about her is her profession.

598
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 She's described by Luke here as a servant girl in Mary's house.

599
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Mary was wealthy, had the largest home in Jerusalem, which is why they gathered there.

600
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Scholars believe that the home of Mary was where the Pentecost actually happened,

601
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 where the Holy Spirit had fallen when they were gathered in the upper room.

602
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 That's this very house.

603
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And in the narrative here, this woman is a servant girl of that house.

604
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 In other words, this is a first century domestic worker.

605
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Her duties and her job was to look after the house, was to clean it,

606
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 was to prepare the food for the people that lived there,

607
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 was to host the guests when they came in.

608
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 That was who Rhoda is.

609
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 If you're sitting in this room and you're a domestic worker,

610
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 I hope this really encourages you.

611
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 This is the Bible story where a domestic worker is the hero of the story.

612
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 I hope that deeply encourages you.

613
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 If you're a domestic worker in this room, Rhoda is just like you.

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 And because she's a servant girl in this house, her very job,

615
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 the nature of that job meant that she had the ability to move

616
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 between the outer courts of the house and the inner sanctum of the house.

617
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And here's the great thing.

618
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 There's a church that's meeting in the inner sanctum and they're praying.

619
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And what are they praying for?

620
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 They're praying for Peter to be released from prison.

621
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 And they're stretching forth, they're sweating blood,

622
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 they're doing the whole thing, they've been doing it for days.

623
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 And because they've been doing it for days,

624
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Rhoda, as a good servant girl, has heard their prayers.

625
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 She knows what they're praying for.

626
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 And in her duties, she's going around and she's on the outer courts

627
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 and suddenly she hears the door knocking.

628
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 She can hear it knocking because she's not so caught up

629
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 in the inner sanctum of the religious activity.

630
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 I bet there was so much noise going on there

631
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 that no one was going to hear the outside door.

632
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Rhoda's in the right position.

633
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 She hears the outside door, she goes towards it,

634
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 and she recognizes Peter's voice.

635
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 Well, of course she did.

636
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Because she'd been around that house for ages and Peter had been there

637
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 and Pentecost had happened there.

638
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 And she knew Peter and she knew his voice.

639
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 She hears his voice and suddenly she freaks out.

640
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 She's so excited.

641
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 She's so excited because she realizes that what they're praying for

642
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 in that room has actually happened.

643
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 That it's now standing here at the door.

644
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 See, Rhoda is the one in the story who's able to connect

645
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 what is happening in the prayer meeting

646
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 to what is actually happening in the real world.

647
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 It's Rhoda who does that. No one else.

648
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 She's uniquely positioned to be between the two worlds

649
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and connect them together.

650
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And she's so excited about it, she's suddenly in a dilemma.

651
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 What do I do? Do I open the door and let him in?

652
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 Or do I tell them that he's there? Do I open?

653
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 No, I've got to tell them.

654
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 And she runs back into the prayer meeting.

655
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 And she says, "Guys, you can stop praying.

656
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 The answer to the prayer is at the door. Woo-hoo!"

657
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Everybody that's praying in the prayer meeting are like,

658
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 "Whoa, whoa, just can you quiet down? Please, we're praying here.

659
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 This is really important right now.

660
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 We're praying for something very important.

661
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 We're praying for Peter's release."

662
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 She's like, "Do you realize that Peter's actually at the door?

663
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 He's at the door."

664
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 And they just keep praying.

665
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 And she keeps saying that he's at the door.

666
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 And during that whole time, Peter's still at the door.

667
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 He's still outside, in danger of being arrested again.

668
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 He's not yet in safety.

669
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 And he can't get into the house.

670
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Think about this for a second.

671
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 This is the great irony of this story.

672
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 It was actually much easier for Peter to get out of the doors of a prison

673
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 than it was for him to get into the doors of a church.

674
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Now that should say something to us.

675
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 That should sober us.

676
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 It should challenge us.

677
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Are we a church that makes entry difficult?

678
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 Is it easier for God to liberate people in the world

679
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 and harder for Him to actually get them to attend church?

680
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 In our season of evangelism and discipleship here in 2022 at the Vine,

681
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 are we in danger of having closed doors, if you will?

682
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Not physically per se in the building, but specifically in the body of Christ?

683
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Do we close the doors of our hearts to certain groups of people

684
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 that we think don't deserve to become Christians?

685
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 Do we close our mind to the idea that certain types of people could become Christians?

686
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Do we shut the metaphorical doors of the body of Christ

687
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 and make it more difficult for people to come and find fellowship and community here

688
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 than it is for them to find grace in Christ Jesus?

689
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 And I think if that is the case, we have to ask ourselves some pretty sobering questions.

690
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 Have we put any barriers?

691
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Is there, let me put it this way, an iron gate,

692
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 not just stopping the prison from the city,

693
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 but stopping the city from the church and the church from the city?

694
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 And if so, maybe we need to do something about it.

695
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 Rhoda is pleading with the church to be aware that their prayer has answered.

696
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 Let me show you what happens next in the story.

697
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 It says this. It says, "You are out of your mind," they told her.

698
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, "Well, it must be his angel then."

699
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 "You're out of your mind," they're saying. "Would you just quiet down, woman? We're praying here."

700
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Like, this is important church business. There's lots of church stuff happening here.

701
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 This is religious activity. Just relax, okay?

702
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 "You're out of your mind. You're stupid. You haven't worked it out. You're just a servant, girl."

703
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 "You don't have it all together. You're not a leader here. You haven't discerned it properly."

704
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 "Leave us alone," is basically what they're saying to her.

705
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 I wonder if any of you in this room have felt that from church leadership at some point in your life.

706
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Whether, if I'm honest, leadership here at the Vine,

707
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 or leadership perhaps in other churches you've attended.

708
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Have you ever felt shut down by leadership?

709
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Have you ever felt like you're not valuable to them?

710
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 Ever felt like you don't have a voice?

711
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 That you're not as spiritual, you don't discern as well?

712
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 That you just stay over there and let us religious people do our religious things?

713
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 I wonder if you've ever felt that way in your family.

714
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 Perhaps some of you in this room are the only Christians in your family.

715
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 Have you ever felt ashamed?

716
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 Have you ever felt like your family have said, "You're out of your mind that you believe that."

717
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 I wonder if anyone in here feels like that in the workplace.

718
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 Maybe your colleagues know that you're a Christian and they think that's a bit strange and a bit unusual.

719
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 And they say, "Who are you? You're out of your mind."

720
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 But Rhoda doesn't give up.

721
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 And I want you to know that you are not to give up.

722
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 She keeps pleading with the church, "Hey, he's there, he's there."

723
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 So eventually they go, "Well, it must be his ghost because it can't physically be him."

724
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 "It can't really be the answer to our prayer. It can't really be that."

725
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 So maybe Herod killed him early and his angel has shown up at the door, banging on the door.

726
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 That's what they think.

727
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 And so they actually go, notice this in the next verse.

728
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 "But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished."

729
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 "Peter motioned with his hands to them to be quiet and describe how the Lord had brought him out of the prison."

730
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
 "Tell James and the brothers about this."

731
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 And then he left for another place.

732
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 They finally go with Rhoda to the outer course of the thing.

733
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 They open the door and Peter is there.

734
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 And the Bible says they're astonished.

735
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 What are they astonished about?

736
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 They're astonished that the thing that they were praying about has actually come to be.

737
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 They're like, "Whoa, we were praying, but we didn't really think it was going to happen."

738
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 "We were excited, but we didn't really think it was going to happen."

739
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 But it's actually happened. They're astonished.

740
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And who is the one who is able to help them to see that the very thing that they were praying for has happened?

741
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 It's not the church leadership.

742
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 It's not the amazingly powerful spiritual people.

743
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Consider the people that were praying.

744
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 These were most of the 12 were in that room.

745
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 This is James, the brother of Jesus was in that room.

746
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 This was the significant senior leadership of the church.

747
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 None of them actually believed the prayer was going to take place.

748
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 The person who believed, who was positioned to know,

749
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 who had the flexibility to understand what was happening in the house,

750
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 and also see what was happening in the world, was not church leadership.

751
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 It was Rhoda.

752
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
 And this story teaches us something.

753
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Not only is it a story where a domestic worker is the hero,

754
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 it's also a story where the church, the pastors, are wrong.

755
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 You should clap for that. That's a good thing for you.

756
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 That should excite you.

757
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 The church leadership, the pastors, were wrong.

758
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 They're not the heroes here.

759
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 And this sets up and changes something dramatically for the whole concept of what church is about.

760
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 That it's actually not about the leaders.

761
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 It's not about the pastors.

762
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 They are there to serve you, love you.

763
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 I love my job. What a privilege it is to be a pastor.

764
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 But church is not about me. It's not about my team.

765
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 It's about you.

766
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 You're the hero of the church story.

767
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 You're Rhoda.

768
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 Because you are the ones whose one foot is in the world and one foot is in church.

769
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 And you can translate between the two of those things.

770
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 You are the ones who are uniquely positioned to take the gospel from here and bring it into the world

771
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 and take what God is doing in the world and communicate it to us in here.

772
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 My job is to 100% serve you, love you, help you to be the best that you can be,

773
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 teach you, pray for you, love you.

774
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 That's my job.

775
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 My feet are in the church and I'm glad that God's given me that calling.

776
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 Your calling though is to be like Rhoda who can move between the two spheres

777
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 and be able to translate the gospel into the world.

778
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 That's who you are.

779
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 And what we learn in this story is something very sobering.

780
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 It's often easier for a miracle to happen than it is for it to be believed.

781
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 The actual miracle of this miracle is the fact that it was believed.

782
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 And why was it believed?

783
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 Because Rhoda changed everything.

784
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
 Because I want you to see this.

785
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Before this moment, the church was praying earnestly, reaching forth,

786
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 but they didn't really believe that it was going to happen.

787
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 But I tell you what, from this moment forward, the early church was dramatically changed.

788
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 From this moment forward, I bet you everybody who was in that room that day praying

789
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 and everybody who saw Peter come in that door, freed by the power of Jesus,

790
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 that that faith level of that church completely changed.

791
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 I bet you every single time they prayed after that, they actually believed that it was going to happen.

792
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
 That at that time, everything changed.

793
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 And who changed it? The church leadership? No.

794
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 Rhoda.

795
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 Somebody that history tends to forget completely changed the church.

796
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Completely gave you your story.

797
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 If you're a Christian in this room, and if you haven't been called to be a part of the staff of the church,

798
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 then you're in full-time ministry like Rhoda was.

799
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 With one foot in the camp of the church, one foot in the world,

800
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 and uniquely positioned to do what I could never do.

801
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 Translate between the two of those things and bring a testimony of the power of God in both of them.

802
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 And I feel like if God's going to do anything in us in this season,

803
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 in this important hour that we're in in Hong Kong and its history,

804
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 we need to be Ananiases, laying hands on one another,

805
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 speaking truth to each other, praying for each other,

806
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 believing the best for each other, raising each other up.

807
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 And we need to be Rhodas, planted in our schools, planted in our workplaces,

808
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 planted in our families, able to say, "I'm proud to be here as well as I'm proud to be in the kingdom."

809
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 And that there is no distinction between secular and sacred,

810
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 that all of us together are a part of the kingdom of God.

811
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 And my work has as much value and as much power as anything else,

812
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 and I straddled it too, and what a gift it is, because this is what church is all about.

813
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 You're a Rhoda, a servant in God's kingdom.

814
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
 May you firmly plant a foot so that you can always open doors

815
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 for those on the outside to come into church.

816
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 And may you always run into the religious activity

817
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 and have the courage to speak what's happening in the world to the church.

818
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 And when that takes place, I believe the body of Christ is truly equipped to be what it should be.

819
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 It won't be equipped by me and the other pastors here.

820
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
 It will only be equipped as the Rhodas are released.

821
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 Run with that anointing. Plant your feet proudly where you are.

822
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 Whatever job it is, whatever career you have, whatever spirit of influence you're planted in,

823
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,000
 you are there for a reason. Embrace it, love it, and see God's glory come out of it.

824
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
 For His glory. In Jesus' name.

825
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 Everyone says? Amen.

826
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
 Would you stand with me? I want to pray for you.

827
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,000
 Father, I just want to thank you so much for all the Rhodas in this room.

828
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 Father, we first of all think of our actual Rhodas, the domestic workers in this room.

829
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
 Our Filipino brothers and sisters, Indonesian brothers and sisters that we love dearly.

830
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
 Father, we want to pray for them in this moment.

831
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
 Father, we ask that you would strengthen them and encourage them.

832
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
 So often their job is a thankless task.

833
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
 So often they're treated a little bit like how Rhodas are treated in this story.

834
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
 Father, we just pray for an anointing and a power upon them.

835
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
 We pray that they would be deeply encouraged by the hero that is Rhoda today.

836
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 And that would inspire them in all the places that you've planted them,

837
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
 the homes of Hong Kong that you have planted them in, Lord.

838
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
 Many of those homes perhaps don't believe in you.

839
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
 We pray that you would use these incredible domestic workers

840
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
 to represent your hands and feet to the people that they are planted within.

841
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
 And Father, we pray for all of us.

842
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
 Each one of us a Rhoda in our own ways.

843
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
 School teachers in this room, lawyers, policemen, politicians,

844
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
 people in marketing and backgrounds there, media,

845
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
 people in the entertainment world,

846
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
 so many different industries represented of course across our services.

847
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 And Father, each one of them has been called by you to be like Rhoda,

848
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
 to be able to connect the world and the church and see them come together,

849
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
 to help the church not be a holy huddle that just forgets everything that's happening in the world

850
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
 and likely enables the kingdom of God to be glorified and testified in the world.

851
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 And so Father, I want to pray for a release over these men and women.

852
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
 I want to ask that you would fill them with inspiration and passion.

853
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 We thank you for Rhoda's story and how it's so much a part of ours now.

854
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,000
 And Lord, would you forgive us where we do look at some things as sacred and some things as secular,

855
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
 where we haven't recognized that this world is yours,

856
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
 that in your death and resurrection you brought everything under your feet,

857
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
 that Paul would say we get to now pray to the name that is above every name,

858
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 and that Lord Hong Kong is yours, China is yours.

859
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
 And Father, we just are so grateful that we have a King and Kings and a Lord of Lords

860
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 who is in control.

861
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
 Father, I pray that you'd fill the church of this city with Rhoda's,

862
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:59,000
 connected to your kingdom, seeing that kingdom in all places.

863
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
 And Father, if there's anyone here that feels devalued,

864
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 anyone here who feels like either the church or others have said, "You're out of your mind."

865
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
 Lord, would you forgive us?

866
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:20,000
 Lord, we pray that you would release us to be your hands and feet in every place that you put us.

867
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

868
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
 Everyone says, "Amen."

869
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
 Amen. Let's worship now together.

870
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
