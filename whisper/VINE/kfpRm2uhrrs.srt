00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 So good to worship together. Thank you worship team. As you turn around, say

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:16,120
 hello to somebody as you sit down. Hello, welcome, good to see you. And if you're

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,400
 watching online then why don't you give us a message, send a message in the chat

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,920
 to say a warm welcome to everyone else online and maybe you're watching and

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,360
 just want to tell us where you're watching from, who you're with, how you

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,760
 are, anything, tell us anything. We'd love to hear from you. We have an online team

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,360
 who always love to engage as well and just to help you feel a little bit more

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,960
 connected here with us as well. So if you are watching here for the first time in

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,960
 person then we would love to give you a very very warm welcome and so as always

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,800
 at the Vine, not to embarrass you but because we are very friendly people,

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,320
 would you give us a wave? We'd love to see you if it's your first time. I know

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,120
 for some of you it's your first time because I met you earlier and welcome,

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:12,040
 welcome, good to see you. And if you're watching online and it's the first time

14
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,880
 joining us then we would also love to hear from you and we have an eConnect

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,080
 card that you can scan the QR code and we will be in contact with you. So for

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,800
 those of you that are visiting in person here we do have a connect hub which is

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,900
 just outside the auditorium and there Jennifer and her team would just love to

18
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,760
 talk with you, tell you a little bit more about who we are, answer some questions

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,600
 maybe that your friend that brought you can't answer, tell you more about who and

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,960
 what we do. A lot happens here at the Vine and we would love to share that

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,720
 with you and a very warm welcome. And for those of us that have come back that

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,580
 have been you know away for a while or now you're back visiting, it's good to see

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,280
 you as well. I know many people are coming back from their summer holidays

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,080
 as well which is great. If you're here in person then you've finished quarantine,

25
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,820
 yes well done. And maybe for some of us those watching online you're in

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:11,720
 quarantine as well, you can do it, not long, you can do it right? Yes. So welcome

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,120
 everyone. For those of you that have maybe been coming for a little while but

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,920
 you're still fairly new and I know over the last six months or so you know we

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,280
 have a lot of people that are joining us, we will be holding a newcomers evening

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,920
 and that's something that we have done regularly over the years but it's

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,680
 something that we haven't done for a while and this is where we have an

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,600
 evening where we get to share about who we are, talk about our vision, you'll get

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,880
 to meet Andrew our senior pastor and a number of the staff that are working

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,160
 here and also at the same time you get to meet some new people and find

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,000
 community. It's a place where hopefully you also feel that you can connect and

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,920
 as you're learning about the vision and the heart of the vine I think it's

37
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,440
 really important that you understand who we are you know and you know where we

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,960
 are going and what our vision is. And so this is a wonderful evening for you to

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,880
 join us and so this will happen on Wednesday the 17th of August at 7.30

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,320
 here in the auditorium and so if you are interested I do encourage you, you can

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,600
 scan the QR code and sign up. We would love to see your faces behind the masks

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:29,200
 of course on the 17th of August. Well as always we'd like to take the

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,720
 opportunity to take up our tithes and offerings now as we move into this time

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,080
 it's very much part of our worship. You know next week we have VBS and VBS as

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,240
 you all know is an incredible children's ministry and it's your giving that

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,440
 allows things like VBS to happen and so as we prepare our hearts to give now can

47
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,060
 I also encourage you to be praying for our children next week and the

48
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,480
 volunteers as they serve and all the activities that are taking place but

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,760
 more importantly that the truth of who God is will really resonate and take

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,880
 root in the hearts of our young people. So throughout the week if you're

51
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,880
 prompted please do pray for VBS we value your prayers. But join me now as we pray

52
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,400
 for our offering. Father we thank you that we get to partner with you and that

53
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,400
 through the generous giving of those in the Vine family the tithes and offerings

54
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,120
 allow us to minister to many many many different people in this city and beyond

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,520
 and so father we give you this offering we ask you to bless it and to enable us

56
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,320
 to steward well to ensure that your kingdom continues to grow in Jesus name

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:54,400
 we pray amen. Well as you know we are in the third week of our sermon series

58
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,000
 which is very practical looking through the book of James and it is my privilege

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,640
 and pleasure to invite our one of our founding fair view here let me do that

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:15,200
 again it is my privilege and pleasure to invite a friend and also one of our

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,320
 founding pastors Pastor John Snellgrove to the stage would you give him a warm

62
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:32,600
 welcome. I can well I can try and pray for you maybe we could all pray here

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,880
 watching online as well let's pray let's pray for John. Father we thank you for

64
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,400
 this word we thank you for the truth of this word and father I pray that as your

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,160
 scripture tells us truth sets us free and so as John speaks powerfully today

66
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,720
 would you anoint him and would those words really resonate and take root in

67
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,840
 our hearts may they be transformative in Jesus name amen. Can we hear it for Carla

68
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,640
 come on please. Before I start I want to give a shout out to my dear brother

69
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,720
 Pastor Tony Harver two founding senior pastors in the church in want welcome

70
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:26,640
 Tony. I'll be honest with you I'm not a fan of the aging process to be honest

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,720
 Tony it doesn't have a lot going for it does it this is a picture of me just

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,960
 before I preached my first sermon at the Vine of senior pastor

73
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:49,040
 Holland. Now one of the features of a typical day at that time was the

74
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,400
 amount of time I spent in front of the bathroom mirror. Sandra will tell you our

75
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,400
 our mirror was huge and I was grooming myself for yet another day in corporate

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:12,160
 Hong Kong. Shower, hair wash and a shaving regime that meant there was not even a

77
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:21,880
 bristle out of place. My mirror was a propeller for my day I was ready to take

78
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:30,000
 on anyone or anything. This is not however the case these days.

79
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:41,960
 Grey hairs, wrinkles, facial hairs growing out of strange places like my ears and

80
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:52,760
 am I allowed to say no. Not enough hair to blow dry or gel. As a result my trip

81
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:02,640
 to the mirror these days is fleeting and I just allow my beard to grow my grey

82
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:13,200
 beard to be precise and then promptly get stuck into my day. In truth I am not

83
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:21,320
 taking any notice of what I see in the mirror. James picks something of this up

84
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:32,320
 in his next passage. Verse 22. Do not merely listen to the word and so deceive

85
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,880
 yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what

86
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,480
 it says is like someone who looks at his face in the mirror and after looking at

87
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,440
 himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But whoever

88
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,280
 looks intently into the perfect word that gives freedom and continues in it

89
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:10,160
 not forgetting what they've heard but doing it they will be blessed in what

90
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,640
 they do. I'll be honest with you I don't want you to listen to this sermon.

91
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,360
 Let me rephrase this careful I just realized that some of you are doing the

92
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:31,000
 wordle now right. I don't want you just to listen to this sermon and to be

93
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,080
 honest I don't really care whether you like it or not. Whether you give me a 7

94
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:46,120
 or an 8 or a 4.5 must do better. It is not enough to hear the word we must do

95
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,800
 it. I'm gonna say that again in case I can get an amen right okay. It is not

96
00:09:51,800 --> 00:10:00,320
 enough to hear the word we must do it. That was pretty good. Many people have

97
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,840
 the mistaken idea that hearing a good sermon or going to a Bible study is what

98
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:16,520
 makes them grow and gets God's blessing. But I'm here today to tell you it is not

99
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:25,240
 the hearing but the doing that brings the blessing. It has been said too many

100
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:35,720
 Christians mark their Bibles but their Bibles never mark them. If you think you

101
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:45,840
 are spiritual because you hear the word you're just kidding yourself. Real faith

102
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:57,560
 means real obedience. Lots of people consider themselves spiritual but not

103
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,560
 nearly as many approach God's Word or his teaching with a commitment to

104
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:13,440
 obedience. Many have what James calls faith without works. Oh they believe oh

105
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:22,480
 yes but their lives are not changed by what they believe. The book of James

106
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,880
 tells us to be doers. Doers of what God says and not just hearers. Let me put it

107
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:41,940
 another way to marry our talk with our walk. Let me go back to my mirror. The

108
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:48,640
 main purpose of owning a mirror is examination. To be able to see yourself

109
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:56,560
 and make yourself look as clean and neat as possible. As we look into the mirror

110
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:05,240
 of God's Word we see ourselves as we really are. And James mentions there are

111
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:13,320
 several mistakes that people make as we look into God's mirror. The first one is

112
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,920
 this they merely glance at themselves. They do not carefully study themselves

113
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,880
 as they read the Word. I mean we've been taught haven't we from an early age

114
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,460
 about the daily quiet time. Now there's nothing wrong with that I'm not knocking

115
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:38,300
 that but for so many and I've seen it it's become like a tick box. Get it over

116
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,960
 with tick the box and move on with your day. Many sincere believers read a chapter

117
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:53,840
 or so of the Bible each day but it is only a religious exercise. My daily quiet

118
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,520
 time. And they fail to profit from it personally. Oh yes they feel guilty

119
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,240
 really guilty if they do not do their daily reading but actually their

120
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:14,040
 conscience should bother them because they read the Word carelessly. Let me say

121
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:21,040
 this a cursory read of the Bible will never reveal our deepest needs. I would

122
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:29,000
 say it's the difference between taking an iPhone photo and an x-ray. The second

123
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,400
 mistake is that they forget what they see. If they were looking deeply enough

124
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,520
 into their hearts what they would see would be unforgettable.

125
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,540
 Remember how biblical characters responded to the true knowledge of their

126
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:57,960
 own hearts. Isaiah "Woe is me" he said "I'm ruined for I'm a man of unclean lips."

127
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:07,880
 Peter said to Jesus "Go away from me Lord I'm a sinful man." And Job probably the

128
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,360
 most righteous man on earth in his day yet he confessed he said "Therefore I

129
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:25,320
 despise myself and repent in dust and ashes." On to mistake number three. They

130
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,480
 fail to obey what the Word tells them to do. They think their hearing is the same

131
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:45,240
 as doing. It is not. We Christians enjoy substituting reading for doing. Even

132
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,920
 talking for being. We attend conferences don't we on topics like evangelism,

133
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,960
 church growth and think we've made progress. Now don't get me wrong I love

134
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:04,520
 church conferences but they are no substitute for service. James 1 25 tells

135
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,080
 us if we are to use God's mirror profitably then we must gaze into it

136
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:20,840
 carefully. He uses the word intently. Quick glances will not cut it. I'm not

137
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:28,400
 talking about whiskers here. We must examine our own hearts and lives in the

138
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,600
 light of God's Word. My friends this requires time, attention and sincere

139
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 devotion. Five minutes or so with God each day will never accomplish a deep

140
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:53,360
 spiritual examination. For the past 15 years I've had the same GP in Hong Kong.

141
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:04,440
 His name is Conrad. He is a specialist in geriatric medicine. That means old people.

142
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:12,760
 Why am I still with him? I'll tell you even in a full waiting room and he does

143
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:19,600
 have a full waiting room. He always spends time with me and has never seemed

144
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:31,720
 in a hurry and he has always told me the truth. For example he was not afraid to

145
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:39,320
 diagnose my clinical depression. This is what he said to me compared to my other

146
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,480
 patients. Remember they're geriatrics. Compared to my other patients you don't

147
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:55,320
 seem depressed. But compared to you, you are. He knew me. Without knowing me he

148
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:03,760
 could not have said this. When Jesus the great physician examines us he uses his

149
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:11,320
 Word and he wants us to give him sufficient time to do the job well.

150
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:17,960
 Perhaps one reason we glance into the Word instead of gazing into the Word is

151
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:25,280
 that we're afraid of what we might see. After seeing ourselves we must remember

152
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,920
 what we are and what God says and we must do the Word. The blessing comes in

153
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:41,600
 the doing not in the reading of the Word. Can I say it again? The blessing comes in

154
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:50,680
 the doing and not in the reading of the Word. Why did James call the Word of God

155
00:17:50,680 --> 00:18:02,160
 the perfect law that gives freedom? Because when we obey it God sets us free.

156
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:11,920
 Look at this from John chapter 8. "If you hold to my teaching you really are my

157
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:22,700
 disciples. Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free." But I

158
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,340
 love this guy James. I mean he's not gonna let up on this subject right?

159
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,380
 There's an interval that comes up. He does a half a chapter on taming the

160
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:40,380
 tongue and favoritism and now he is going for the jugular again. What good is

161
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:47,420
 it my brothers and sisters if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?

162
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:54,680
 Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and

163
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:02,200
 daily food. If one of you says, "Oh go in peace, keep warm and well fed. I'll put

164
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,960
 you on the prayer list." You know but does nothing about their physical needs. What

165
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,620
 good is it? In the same way faith by itself if not accompanied by action is

166
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:22,300
 dead. But someone will say, "Hey you have faith I have deeds. Show me your faith

167
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:29,140
 without deeds and I will show you my faith by my deeds." You believe there is

168
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:40,340
 one God? Good! Even the demons believe that. Shut up. You foolish person. You want

169
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:47,900
 evidence that faith without deeds is useless? Was not our father Abraham

170
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,960
 considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the

171
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,140
 altar? You see that his faith and his actions were working together and his

172
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,860
 faith was made complete by what he did. And the scripture was fulfilled that

173
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:11,180
 said Abraham believed God and it was credit to him as righteousness and he

174
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:18,580
 was called God's friend. You see that a person is considered righteous by what

175
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:26,680
 they do and not by faith alone. In the same way was not even Rahab the

176
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,240
 prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the

177
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,860
 spies and sent them off in a different direction? As the body without the spirit

178
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:56,140
 is dead so faith without deeds is dead. Wow my friends faith is a key doctrine

179
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,620
 in the Christian life. Scripture tells us doesn't it that a sinner is saved by

180
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:08,820
 faith and the believer must walk by faith. It says without faith it's

181
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:19,020
 impossible to please God and whatever we do apart from faith is sin. I love

182
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:27,360
 Hebrews chapter 11 the great gallery of men and women of faith. It starts off now

183
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,500
 faith is the confidence in what we hope for and the assurance about what we do

184
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:42,180
 not see. In this chapter we meet men and women who acted on God's Word no matter

185
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:49,420
 what price they had to pay. Faith is not a feeling that we will somehow work up.

186
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:56,280
 Faith is confidence that God's Word is true and conviction that acting on that

187
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,380
 Word will bring his blessing. Verse 6 I've read it already without faith it's

188
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:14,300
 impossible to please God. In the passage that I just read James discusses the

189
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:22,580
 relationship between faith and works. This is an important discussion for if

190
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:29,900
 we are wrong in this matter we jeopardize our eternal salvation. This is

191
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,740
 why it's so important you being in church today you being online today and

192
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:43,780
 it leads me to some questions. What kind of faith really saves a person? Is it

193
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,580
 necessary to perform good works to be saved? How can a person tell whether or

194
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,620
 not he is exercising true saving faith?

195
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:03,580
 James answered these questions in these verses and he said to us there are three

196
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:15,220
 three kinds of faith only one of which is true saving faith. And the first one

197
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,700
 is this dead faith. I read it earlier what good is it if someone claims to have

198
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:27,420
 faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or sister is

199
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:33,820
 without clothes or daily food. If one of you says to them go in peace bless you

200
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,980
 keep warm keep well fed and does nothing about their physical needs what good is

201
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:49,980
 it? In the same way faith in itself if not accompanied by action is dead. People

202
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:58,820
 with dead faith substitute words for deeds. Oh they talk a great spiritual

203
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:06,860
 language. Oh they might be experts at Bible memory verses but their walk does

204
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:13,500
 not measure up to their talk. And Jesus gives a simple illustration. A poor

205
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,700
 believer comes into the fellowship like this without proper clothing and in need

206
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:27,820
 of food. The person with dead faith noticed the visitors but did not do

207
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:35,500
 anything to meet his needs. All he did was give a few pious words. We'll put you

208
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,380
 on the WhatsApp chat group we'll pray for you you know. Go in peace keep warm

209
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:47,500
 and be well fed. But the visitor went away just as hungry and just as naked as

210
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:58,180
 they came in. To help a person in need is an expression of love and faith works by

211
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:06,380
 love. The Apostle John emphasized this aspect of good works. I love this. If

212
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,980
 anyone has material possessions and he sees a brother or sister in need but has

213
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:18,860
 no pity on them how could the love of God be in that person? Dear children let

214
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:24,940
 us love with words. Let's not love with words or speech but with actions and in

215
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:33,580
 truth. The priest and the Levite in the parable of the Good Samaritan each had

216
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:40,220
 religious training but neither of them neither of them paused to assist the

217
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:48,620
 dying man. This guy was dying at the side of the road. I'm sure the priest and the

218
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:56,300
 Levite probably both PhDs could have astounded us by delivering a good

219
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:04,300
 powerful sermon full of biblical references. Yet neither demonstrate that

220
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:12,540
 faith in loving works. I want to ask a leading question. One you might want to

221
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:19,580
 talk about in your community groups this week. Can the kind of faith that is never

222
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:27,140
 seen in practical works save us? Can the kind of faith that is never seen in

223
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:37,460
 practical works save us? And my answer and one that I believe is supported by

224
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:47,220
 Scripture is no. Look at what James said. In the same way faith by itself if not

225
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:54,940
 accompanied by action is dead. Now you might ask is that contradicting Paul and

226
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:03,100
 especially Romans which teaches justification by faith? How many times

227
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:12,820
 does Paul say it is by faith that you are saved? A great question. I'm gonna

228
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:20,980
 turn to the great theologian John Calvin for an answer. He said this, "It is faith

229
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:32,020
 alone that justifies but faith that justifies can never be alone." That's good

230
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:39,460
 isn't it? James says it in a similar way. He says true saving faith can never be by

231
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:48,980
 itself. It always brings life and life produces good works. The person with dead

232
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:56,060
 faith has only an intellectual experience. He knows the right words but

233
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:04,220
 he does not back up his words with his works. Three times, three times James says

234
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:11,420
 in this passage he warns us faith without works is dead.

235
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:24,260
 Vine Church, growing big people does not simply mean growing your spiritual IQ.

236
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,300
 Dead faith is not saving faith. Dead faith is counterfeit faith and lulls a

237
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:40,700
 person into a false confidence of eternal life. James as he always does he

238
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:47,260
 steps it up another gear. He wanted to shock his complacent readers so he used

239
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:58,980
 demons as his illustration. Let's read it, "But someone will say you have faith I

240
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,540
 have deeds but show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my

241
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,820
 faith by my deeds. You believe there is one God good even the demons believe

242
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,820
 that and they shudder." Now this might raise a question amongst some of you.

243
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:25,500
 Pastor John, can we really believe these days in the existence of demons and

244
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:34,060
 unclean spirits? Well the Bible is clear that such creatures do indeed exist. On

245
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:39,100
 52 separate occasions in the New Testament we have references to demons

246
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:49,060
 and there are another 23 references to unclean spirits. But does it come as a

247
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:58,180
 shock to you that demons have faith? I mean what do they believe? For one thing

248
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,180
 they believe in the existence of God. They're not atheists, they're not

249
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:11,500
 agnostics. They also believe in the deity of Christ. Whenever they met Christ on

250
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,020
 this earth they bore witness to his sonship. They believe in the existence of

251
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,220
 a place of punishment and they recognize Jesus Christ as the judge and they

252
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:31,060
 submit, they submit to the power of his word. This verse 19 is quite interesting.

253
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:40,340
 James said, "You believe that there is one God." It may have been a reference to one

254
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:49,460
 of the central ideas of Judaism. Known as the Shema, it is found in Deuteronomy 6

255
00:30:49,460 --> 00:31:02,420
 4, "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one." Every one of James's Jewish leaders would

256
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,980
 have grown up agreeing with that truth and they say this every day if not

257
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:19,340
 several times a day. But James's point is this, it is not enough just to agree. Can

258
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:31,100
 I like level with you? Those who put talk about God but fail to act in ways

259
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:40,980
 consistent with their belief, those people are put in the same category as

260
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:51,260
 demons. It means knowing but not trusting. It means dead faith rather than saving

261
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:58,460
 faith. The danger of this condition is that someone that we might describe as a

262
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:05,860
 religious person can spend their entire lives in simple agreement without ever

263
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:13,460
 crossing into true and living faith. My friends, this looks bleak but don't

264
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:22,940
 despair. James has the answer. He has introduced us to two kinds of faith that

265
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:33,140
 can never save the sinner, dead faith and demonic faith. He closes the passage by

266
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:47,460
 describing the only kind of faith that can save the sinner, dynamic faith. Look

267
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:57,500
 at this slide. Dynamic faith is faith that is real. Dynamic faith is faith that

268
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:08,140
 has power. Dynamic faith results in a changed life and James describes this

269
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:17,540
 true saving faith. To begin with, dynamic saving faith is based on the Word of God.

270
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:24,220
 We receive our spiritual rebirth through God's Word. We receive the Word and it

271
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:35,540
 saves us. James points out the true saving faith leads to action. My friends,

272
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,980
 dynamic faith does not stop at intellectual agreement. It leads to

273
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:49,020
 obedience on the part of the wheel. And this obedience is not an isolated event.

274
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:57,420
 It continues throughout life. It leads to works. Where there is dynamic faith, where

275
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:04,980
 there is saving faith, you will always find good works. And James gives a

276
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,020
 perfect illustration. He illustrates his doctrine in the life of two well-known

277
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:20,060
 Bible persons, Abraham and Rahab. You couldn't find two more different people.

278
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:31,220
 Abraham was a Jew. Rahab was a Gentile. Abraham was a godly man. But Rahab was a

279
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:38,420
 sinful woman, a harlot. Abraham is described as the friend of God, whereas

280
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:50,180
 Rahab belonged to the enemies of God. So what did they have in common? Both

281
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:59,100
 exercised saving faith in God. The Bible tells us Abraham did not work for his

282
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,900
 righteousness. He received it as a gift from God. He was declared righteous by

283
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:11,220
 faith. He was justified by faith. Please read Romans chapter 4. Justification is

284
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:21,700
 an important doctrine in the Bible. But my question, how do you tell if a person

285
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:28,980
 is justified by faith, if faith is essentially a personal thing between

286
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:38,220
 that person and God? Abraham's example answers that important question. The

287
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:47,420
 justified person has a changed life and obeys God's will. His faith is

288
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:53,900
 demonstrated by his works. James then goes on to another event in Abraham's

289
00:35:53,900 --> 00:36:00,140
 life, an event that took place many years after Abraham's conversion. The event is

290
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,820
 the offering up of Isaac on the altar at Genesis 22. You know the story, don't you?

291
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:12,860
 Isaac was the promised son, born to Abraham when he was over 90. And his wife

292
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:20,140
 Sarah, who had been barren, was over 80. But God wanted to see if Abraham was

293
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:31,740
 willing to sacrifice his son. I believe this. Abraham was not saved by obeying

294
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:40,780
 God's difficult command, but his obedience proved that he already was

295
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,180
 saved. James puts it like this in verse 22. You see that his faith and his actions

296
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:53,780
 were working together, and that his faith was made complete by what he did. This is

297
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:01,740
 a perfect relationship between faith and works. As someone expressed it, Abraham

298
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:14,060
 was not saved by faith plus works, but by a faith that works. I love that, don't you?

299
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:23,300
 Simon Gray, you weren't saved by faith plus works, but saved by a faith that

300
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:32,740
 works. That's true for all of us. His second illustration is Rahab, and the

301
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:38,660
 background is Joshua 2 and Joshua 6. The story here is that Israel was about to

302
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:44,740
 invade the Promised Land and take the city of Jericho. Joshua sent spies in the

303
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:51,220
 city to lay hold of the land, and they met Rahab, a harlot, a prostitute, who

304
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:56,180
 protected them and affirmed that she believed in what God had said and what

305
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:02,740
 God was going to do. When the men departed, they promised to save her and

306
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:09,660
 her family when the city was taken, and this they did. This is an exciting story.

307
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:20,220
 But in it, it is one of Bible's great examples of saving faith. Rahab even

308
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:28,820
 appears in the chapter as a hero of faith in Hebrews 11. Rahab exercised

309
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:35,420
 dynamic faith. Her mind knew the truth. Her heart was stirred by the truth, and her

310
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:42,820
 will acted on that truth. She proved her faith by her works. I mean, this is

311
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:48,940
 amazing. I mean, we told who this woman is, and you realize she only had a small

312
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:55,660
 amount of information. When we realize that, you can see how truly marvelous her

313
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:11,460
 faith really was. Now today, 2022, we, you and I, have the full revelation of God

314
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:22,020
 through His Word and His Son. We live on the other side of Calvary. We have the

315
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:30,300
 Holy Spirit, and we welcomed Him, didn't we? We have the Holy Spirit to convict

316
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:37,660
 and teach us the Word. And Luke 12, 48 says this, "For everyone who has been

317
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:44,180
 given much," I think it's fair to say we've been given much, "much will be

318
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:56,220
 demanded." My friends, the mature Christian practices the truth. His faith is not the

319
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,540
 dead faith of the intellectuals. It's not the demonic faith of the fallen spirits.

320
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:11,100
 It is instead the dynamic faith of men like Abraham and women like Rahab, faith

321
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:18,940
 that changes a life and goes to work for God. I've said a lot this morning. I'm

322
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:28,780
 gonna give James the last words. Verse 26, "As the body without the spirit is dead,

323
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:42,780
 so faith without deeds is dead." Faith without deeds is dead. May we examine our

324
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:55,140
 hearts and lives to make sure that we possess true saving faith, dynamic faith.

325
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:07,140
 As I ask the band to come up, maybe just close your eyes for a minute. I believe

326
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:20,340
 this is a time of reflection. It's a time of searching. It's not time to be thinking

327
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:31,660
 what you're gonna be having for lunch. Just search your heart. Is my faith dead,

328
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:41,060
 demonic, or dynamic? What I want to do is I want to pray a verse over you. It's a

329
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:55,340
 verse from the Psalms. From Psalm 139. "Search me, O Lord. Search me, O Lord, and

330
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:07,540
 know my heart. Try me and know my thoughts and see if there is any wicked

331
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:19,260
 way in me and lead me in the way everlasting."

332
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,660
 We're gonna do something different as we come to the final song. I'm not gonna ask

333
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:34,340
 you to stand. I'm gonna ask you to stay in this posture of reflection. I'm gonna

334
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:40,220
 ask you to gaze in the mirror, your spiritual mirror.

335
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:52,620
 There may be people here today or online where actually you gaze in the mirror.

336
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,700
 You need to come back to the cross of Jesus.

337
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,620
 You need to offer your life to Jesus afresh.

338
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:15,980
 For years all you've had is an intellectual faith. It's in your head.

339
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:36,980
 I believe there's no limit to what God will do with a church that does what it

340
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:47,940
 believes. As we pray for ourselves, let's pray for our church. Let's pray for our city.

341
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:58,980
 (music)

342
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:06,900
 Holy Spirit is here. Just ask Him to come to you again.

343
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:16,100
 (music)

344
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:24,700
 The Holy Spirit is not just about us feeling good, getting goose bumps, having

345
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:34,460
 experiences. Nothing wrong with any of those. But if it's not manifested in us

346
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:44,180
 going out from this building onto the streets of Hong Kong and practicing what

347
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:49,600
 we've heard in here today. That the Holy Spirit would say to you, "Have you been

348
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:56,660
 gazing in the mirror?" That person on the MTR there needs someone to go and talk

349
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:04,700
 to them. They're really struggling. That friend of yours needs a telephone call

350
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:09,340
 with all the things they've been going through.

351
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:14,300
 (music)

352
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:19,260
 That person needs you to open your wallet and give them some money for lunch.

353
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,780
 Otherwise they won't get lunch today.

354
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:35,740
 Just be open to the Holy Spirit telling you how what we've heard this morning

355
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:45,140
 can be put in practice. And what a difference it would make to our city, to

356
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:53,860
 our world that is becoming so much more individualistic about me, myself, and I.

357
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:02,860
 I pray that as we sing this song together, God is going to give each one

358
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:14,740
 of you, by His Holy Spirit, fresh eyes. Fresh eyes to see the world differently.

359
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:27,620
 We've got to stop seeing the world through our own eyes, our own needs.

360
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:35,260
 Faith without works is dead.

361
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,100
 Bye.

362
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:46,100
