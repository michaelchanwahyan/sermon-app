[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120]   And we thank you, Jesus.
[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.120]   In your name we pray.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120]   Amen, amen.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.120]   Over to you.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120]   Thanks, Jess.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.260]   So I'm sure you would agree with me that there have been some pretty incredible inventions
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.360]   over the years, the centuries, right?
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.560]   That really have transformed and revolutionized how we do things, even the simple things,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.160]   you know, like a light bulb.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.760]   Could you imagine if we didn't have a light bulb?
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.760]   Technology.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   Even an umbrella.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.400]   Who was thankful for the invention of an umbrella today?
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.160]   The World Wide Web Internet as we know it.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.400]   I mean, sometimes we may not be thankful, but I think the majority of us would say technology
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.440]   has advanced at incredible paces, and if you're watching online, you get to benefit with that
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.200]   as well today.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:04.280]   Well, one of my favorite inventions has to be the Kindle.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.600]   I love the Kindle.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.680]   Now I know all of you book lovers out there, you know, the ones that like to touch and
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.800]   feel and smell the pages.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.840]   Yes, yes, I know we're getting nods here.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.080]   Heather Rose, I know you're watching online.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.240]   I know you love your books as well.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.520]   Well, I love the books, the Kindles, especially living in Hong Kong, because you know what
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.600]   it's like if we have too many books?
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.160]   Where do we put them?
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.760]   So with a Kindle, you can have hundreds of books, and you do not have to worry about
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.840]   storage, right?
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:50.000]   I love my Kindle because I love reading, and I love stories, and stories can be powerful
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.680]   tools that really do shape how we think and how we view the world.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.880]   Think of your favorite movie or book.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.680]   When you're immersed in that book or that movie, and you are so engrossed with what's
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.800]   happening, you have no idea what's happening outside of that book or that movie, and your
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.520]   brain is telling you that you are part of that story.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520]   Well, there is a term for this.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.200]   It's called narrative transportation theory.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.920]   Did you know that?
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   It's true.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.800]   It's amazing what you learn here in church.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.600]   Narrative transportation theory, seriously.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.080]   This suggests that the power of stories can actually change attitudes and intentions that
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.680]   are reflected in the story.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.040]   I am 100% convinced this is true.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:00.640]   When I watch Tomb Raider, I am Lara Croft, and I am abseiling down the IFC.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.800]   Now if you've never watched Tomb Raider, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but the
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.120]   point is in our 21st century, with social media, we know that stories impact us.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.440]   It can be negative, and it can be positive.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.240]   And I love that Jesus was way ahead of all the philosophers and the psychologists of
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.480]   the past and the influencers of the present in understanding how stories draw listeners
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.680]   in.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.800]   They influence thoughts, feelings, and behavior.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:46.600]   And as we come to the end of our series on parables, we have seen how Jesus used stories
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.960]   to disrupt, to challenge, and inspire.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.280]   Jesus was not just a great storyteller.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.840]   Jesus intentionally provoked the imagination of his audience to dismantle their views of
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:14.120]   the world, in particular its value system, so that the true nature of God's world would
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.320]   be revealed, and that would inspire change.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.440]   Jesus knew that the people that gathered around him, those that loved him, those that hated
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.200]   him, and those that weren't quite sure what they thought about him, were far more likely
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.280]   to be challenged to look at the world differently when they heard parables, stories that they
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.480]   could help see the world, force them to think, make choices.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:56.520]   Do they embrace this new upside-down value system, or do they ignore it and just continue
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.640]   with life as they have always done and face the consequences?
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.040]   And this week, we are looking at the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, found in the
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.040]   Gospel of Luke.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.120]   So as we open up God's word, as we listen to Jesus's words, let's also be willing to
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.200]   dismantle our own worldviews, challenge some of our behaviors, so that we are inspired
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.080]   to live a kingdom lifestyle.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.640]   And as I read through Luke now, I want to invoke your imagination.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.960]   We're going to do that through words and art.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.360]   And so as I read, you will see various artistic interpretations of this parable presented
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.240]   over the centuries.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:59.720]   So sit back, look, and listen.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.680]   There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.240]   At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores, longing to eat what fell
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.560]   from the rich man's table.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.600]   Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.180]   The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.040]   The rich man also died and was buried in Hades, where he was in torment.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.240]   He looked up and saw Abraham far away with Lazarus by his side.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.840]   So he called to him, "Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:45.160]   of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire."
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.040]   But Abraham replied, "Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.480]   while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.080]   And besides all this, between us and you, a great chasm has been set in place, so that
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:10.120]   those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us."
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.640]   He answered, "Then I beg you, Father, send Lazarus to my family, for I have five brothers.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   Let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment."
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.360]   Abraham replied, "They have Moses and the prophets.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.200]   Let them listen to them."
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.680]   "No, Father Abraham," he said, "but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent."
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.280]   He said to them, "If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced,
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:49.880]   even if someone rises from the dead."
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:56.920]   So what was Jesus trying to convey to the audience of his day?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.780]   From the previous verses, we can assume that Jesus is addressing the parable to his disciples
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:09.080]   and to the Pharisees, who had earlier been sneering at Jesus when Jesus was teaching
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.320]   the disciples that you cannot love God and money.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:21.240]   And as Jesus begins this parable, we know, or we can just imagine, how annoyed the Pharisees
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.720]   were beginning to be with Jesus.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:32.020]   There are two main characters that Jesus introduces at the start, the rich man and Lazarus.
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.320]   And we have vivid descriptions that leave the listeners in no doubt that we have someone
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:43.800]   very wealthy who's living a life of luxury and indulgence in contrast to a man named
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.400]   Lazarus, who is living in inhumane misery.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.880]   Even the dogs are mistreating him.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:09:00.640]   He's destitute, isolated, alone, hungry, physically and emotionally suffering.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:08.400]   Now interestingly, this is the only parable where Jesus actually names one of his characters.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.640]   And scholars debate various different reasons why Jesus does this.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:21.400]   But what it does show is how significant this suffering man was to God.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.640]   Calling someone by their name is very personal.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.920]   It invokes a connection to that person.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:35.800]   And here, our pearl man is named Lazarus, which actually means God helps, and which
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.760]   we see as being prophetic as the story unfolds.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.280]   This is an important reminder to us today.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:56.800]   And it should be a comfort in a world where it is easy to feel nameless and unknown, forgotten,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.640]   unseen.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:07.000]   God does know us, he does see us, and he calls us by name.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.800]   Some of you are here today, and maybe immediately you identify with Lazarus.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.280]   You too are suffering in your own ways.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.120]   You don't feel seen.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.240]   You don't feel heard.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   You don't feel known.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.880]   You have huge needs that are crushing you at times, needs that you share and needs that
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.920]   you hold, and only you know the weight of them.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   Well, my prayer for you today is as we unfold this story together, that while you're here,
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.600]   you would experience the Holy Spirit ministering very personally to you.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:56.240]   Because as I stand here and I look out at lots of different faces, God looks out and
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:02.320]   he sees every one of you and knows you by name.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:09.840]   May God minister to you personally, and may you leave here being known, being seen, being
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.640]   loved, and with hope.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:23.600]   Jesus makes this contrast with a nameless rich man who doesn't invoke any sympathy.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.280]   And even though Lazarus is on the doorstep of the rich man, he's lying right in front
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.120]   of him, there is no excuse for not knowing that this Lazarus is there.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:43.680]   But the rich man is portrayed as doing nothing, simply living his life his way every day.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.840]   And then as the story unfolds, we see a dramatic switch in their circumstances, which happens
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.320]   when they both die.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.520]   Death comes to us all.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.560]   This would have been a reminder to everyone, it's a reminder for us today, regardless whether
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.960]   you're rich, you're poor, whether you obey the law, you don't obey the law, whether you're
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:17.000]   a good person or whether you're a bad person, nobody can escape death.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.920]   There is no escaping death, and there's no escaping judgment after death.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:28.560]   But there is also hope, and that's what we see in Lazarus.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:36.800]   Hope also for us as believers in Jesus that despite the challenges that we face now, despite
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:46.960]   the pain or the suffering that we endure, we will know hope, we will know comfort.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.120]   Now Jesus is drawing on the ancient Jewish teachings of that day, which for sure the
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.500]   Pharisees would have been very familiar with.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:03.680]   He introduces his listeners into the afterlife, the concept of paradise and hell, which in
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.520]   the Greek is referred to by Luke as Hades.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.960]   It's strong imagery, would have been very familiar, very familiar to the Jewish people
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:21.920]   of Jesus' day, which paints that picture of this great patriarchal figure of Abraham comforting
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:29.440]   and blessing Lazarus while the rich man is suffering and in great torment.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   And again, the power in Jesus' storytelling is that it was relatable to his audience,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:43.480]   its familiar language, its culture, and its beliefs that were prevalent at their time.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.640]   The Pharisees believed in a bodily resurrection with life after death, where good deeds were
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.920]   rewarded and bad deeds punished.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.880]   So they would have had no problem accepting that Abraham was in paradise, welcoming the
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.340]   righteous.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.440]   No doubt the Pharisees though, living with an assumed presumption that they were all
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.760]   going to go to paradise one day.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:20.480]   But as Jesus depicts in this particular parable, the one rewarded here and the one punished
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:28.280]   portrays a very different value system, which would have challenged his listeners.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:34.840]   You see, what is interesting is that the rich man is not portrayed as having committed a
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.680]   particular sin.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.300]   Doesn't look like he actually did anything wrong.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.320]   Having money, being blessed with material wealth is not a sin.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.040]   Jesus never said it was.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.720]   Rather it is how we live with what we have.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:03.440]   And in this case, it is the rich man's inaction and selfish living for himself that Jesus
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.800]   is calling out.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.320]   Jesus is not condemning him for being rich.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.440]   This is not a parable against those that have plenty.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:20.680]   But Jesus' story was showing in the kingdom of God of which Jesus was there to proclaim,
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:28.200]   the poor and the suffering would be comforted and be rewarded as righteous and those that
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.160]   lived for themselves would be held to account.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.760]   Not only is Jesus highlighting the lack of action by the rich man, he also portrays the
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.400]   rich man's arrogance.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.000]   This is arrogant attitude.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.840]   It continues right after his death.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:57.120]   His language may be respectful to Father Abraham, but he has this expectation that Lazarus should
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.600]   come and serve him.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.540]   It's almost demonstrating this sense of entitlement.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:10.720]   There is this assumption by the rich man that Lazarus should leave his place of blessing
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:18.200]   by Abraham's side and go over and join him to alleviate his suffering.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.400]   And Abraham's response to this is basically, "No."
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.680]   He points out a very different set of values, very different set of values and a sense of
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.480]   justice.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.960]   After all, the rich man had already received all his good things on earth as Abraham had
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.800]   told him.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:45.280]   And only then do we see a glimpse of the rich man thinking of others as he pleads on behalf
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.600]   of his brothers.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:53.400]   But again, the response from Abraham implies that the rich man neglected scripture, its
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:01.360]   teachings, and even a miracle of somebody rising from the dead would make no difference.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.440]   I cannot help but imagine how the readers of the Gospel of Luke would have made that
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:13.560]   connection right at the early church between Jesus' own resurrection and how true his words
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:24.040]   would be in their context when even after Jesus rose again, so many refused to believe.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.240]   The kingdom of God was at the heart of Jesus' teaching.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.560]   Not only did his parables focus on helping people to understand how the kingdom functioned,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.520]   but he also challenged people to change their behaviors when seeking his kingdom.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.920]   The Pharisees, many, many of the religious leaders of Jesus' day, they focused heavily
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.740]   on the law, or they appeared to do so.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:59.220]   But they neglected the spirit behind God's law, the heart of God.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.880]   They ignored the real needs of the people around them, and Jesus would not tolerate
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.840]   that.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.560]   Jesus was so confrontational to the religious leaders at his time.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.360]   You just need to read Matthew 23.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.520]   I love Matthew 23.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:26.040]   Jesus absolutely slams the religious leaders of his time.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:34.320]   They represented the antithesis of who God is, his heart for the poor and the vulnerable.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:43.160]   The Pharisees themselves played needless burdens on the people, and Jesus called them proud,
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:51.440]   boastful, show-offs, blind fools, pretenders, a brood of snipers.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.000]   The list just goes on.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.320]   In the kingdom of God, the poor, the suffering, the downcast, the oppressed are not unknown
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.600]   by God.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.040]   They will be blessed.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.920]   Never think that God is not aware or concerned with those living in poverty, those that are
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.160]   vulnerable, those that are suffering or oppressed.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.200]   Scripture's very clear how much God is on the side of the vulnerable and speaks again
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:27.760]   and again for the justice for the marginalized and comfort to those who are in pain.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.400]   That is a comfort to us.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.640]   The disciples were also present listening to this story, and I wonder what went through
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.040]   their minds.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.440]   Did they relate to Lazarus and his suffering?
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:48.160]   Some of them would have had to have left their own material comforts as they followed Jesus,
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.560]   suffered their own hardship and persecution along the way.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.200]   But they would have witnessed time and time again of Jesus modeling to them what it means
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.560]   to reach out and care for the poor, for the suffering.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:13.840]   Jesus didn't ignore it, and his disciples could not either, and neither should we.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:21.400]   Jesus spoke parables to teach about God's world that was in the present and in the future.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.680]   And he lived out this new world by healing the sick, setting the oppressed free, caring
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.480]   for the poor, speaking up for the marginalized.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:40.080]   And the disciples were in the midst of seeing the kingdom of God at work in real time with
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:47.480]   Jesus, and they were challenged also to make their own choices in how they responded in
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.680]   their own actions and attitudes.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.960]   Those hearing this parable would have understood it to mean inaction and indifference to the
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:04.920]   poor and suffering were not acceptable in the kingdom of God, never has been and never
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.520]   will be.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.280]   So what does this actually mean for us?
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.960]   How does this parable reshape our worldviews?
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.840]   How does it challenge us?
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:26.760]   How does it inspire us to live proactively with kingdom values, and maybe sometimes those
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.800]   values that are countercultural?
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:39.560]   I think for many of us, we do respond practically to help the poor and the marginalized.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   We use our resources in various ways, whether it's our time, our finances, our skill set.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.000]   And I know many of you here are very generous.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.520]   I just heard recently that there are a group of you that every Monday you're cooking on
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.400]   the first floor in our kitchen, preparing food, and then you're going out and you're
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.400]   feeding the homeless.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.600]   And you've been doing that for years.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   I know that many of you work for NGOs or are in professions that care for others, that
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:22.280]   require you to advocate daily for those that maybe are of a lesser social status.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:29.080]   There are many of you here that are providing extra support to the poor and the marginalized.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:35.480]   And some of you are in positions of power, of influence, and you are choosing to make
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:41.040]   a difference, to use your resources to help others.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:47.200]   You will hear us preach and teach from the front about the importance of social justice,
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.960]   about how it's important to treat each other respectfully and fairly.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:59.960]   We will even call each other out when we've witnessed or seen some behaviors that don't
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:06.280]   treat people fairly, and we've spoken about those from the front as well.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.120]   And that's all good.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.440]   And let's keep doing good.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:17.280]   And let's keep using our resources and making a difference and being a light in this city.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:26.280]   But what I want to ask us is a question around how easily it is for our attitudes to subtly
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:33.840]   change which actually will affect our response and our relationship to those in need and
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.720]   our relationship to God.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:42.640]   And we need to be on guard of those so we don't find ourselves suddenly acting like
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.320]   the rich man.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:52.040]   I think the first attitude that we need to watch out for is this indifference.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.160]   Indifference can come subtly towards us.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.120]   We see it in this parable, even though the needs of Lazarus are very clearly in front
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.480]   of the rich man every single day, the rich man ignores him.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.800]   And I think it can creep into our own lives without realizing it as our hearts can suddenly
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.720]   become a little bit hard.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.760]   The reality is the world has a lot of needs.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.520]   It can feel overwhelming at times.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:31.920]   Many years ago, my husband and I, we set up a charity that was involved in working with
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.760]   a country that was facing huge economic collapse.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.240]   We were specifically working with abandoned children.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   We were newly married.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:49.360]   And honestly, there was a lot of sacrifice that went into setting this up, traveling,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.560]   and not just the time but the money as well.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:02.160]   And after a while, the demands, the constant demands that we, that I felt, started to get
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.200]   to me.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.320]   And it wasn't until after a few years that I realized that actually I had become a little
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   bit indifferent to those immediate needs around me, and that a sense of hardened heart had
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.200]   crept in.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:29.240]   And I knew that because I found that I had this subconscious attitude of, "I've done
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:34.120]   enough.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.400]   I've done a lot.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.520]   I'm tired.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.960]   I've done enough."
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.080]   Of course, I wouldn't say it, but I realized that that was something that was very real
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.320]   in my life.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.680]   And it was only when I actually went to God and said, "You know what, God?
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:56.320]   I need you to break my heart for what breaks yours."
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:05.400]   And as Christians, I think that's something that we have got to regularly be asking ourself
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.200]   and praying.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:12.360]   It's not enough to do it just because it's the right thing to do.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:21.280]   But if we could regularly ask God, "God, break my heart for what breaks yours," then that
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:30.200]   would keep our hearts soft and that attitude of indifference away.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.960]   The second attitude to be mindful of is entitlement.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.040]   Oh, yes, it's a subtle one as well.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:45.120]   And I'm sure at various times in our lives, we have had that sense of entitlement where
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.940]   you think you deserve special treatment.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.520]   Maybe it's, "I've studied really, really hard and I've gone to a great university and therefore
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.040]   I deserve to have that better job with more benefits."
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.680]   Or maybe it's a case of, "Well, actually, I come from a first world country and therefore
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:12.360]   I'm a lot more knowledge educated than maybe somebody else."
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:24.440]   Maybe it's, "I don't have enough and you have a lot and so therefore you should help me."
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:31.600]   You see, entitlement has many different levels, but it does creep in.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.040]   The rich man's sense of entitlement, that was clear, seen in his expectation even after
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.560]   death when he thought Lazarus should go over and serve him.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:48.720]   There was no awareness that he had done anything wrong, but rather excuse after excuse.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:56.480]   But in contrast, we see Lazarus who actually doesn't say a word throughout the whole parable.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.580]   He doesn't complain about his life.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:04.840]   He doesn't complain or express any resentment with the rich man.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:11.600]   There's no gloating or suffering now that the rich man is in a different position.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.560]   I'm not sure I would be so gracious.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.600]   So we need to check our hearts.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:25.240]   We need to check our hearts for that entitlement and we need to have that humility where we
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:34.440]   recognize that actually all that we have is given by God and that everything belongs to
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.440]   God.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:41.280]   And that humility keeps us in an attitude where we are constantly again reflecting and
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:49.400]   choosing to follow God's ways, have his heart so that that's the attitude that we're responding
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.960]   to others with.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:29:00.800]   But imagine in the city of Hong Kong or the place where you're residing now, if we as
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.320]   followers of Jesus decided to adopt the kingdom principles which saw us acting in generous
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:14.560]   ways, kindness and compassion to everyone around us.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.880]   Recently the Hong Kong Tourism Board launched a new campaign to encourage people to be more
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:26.280]   hospitable to each other, especially the tourists, right?
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.840]   I don't know why but apparently we as Hong Kongers can be rather unfriendly and rude.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.600]   I don't think that's true.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.960]   But anyway, I actually think it came from this kindness movement that Singapore launched
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.560]   a number of years ago.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:45.000]   They also said that they would like their people to be encouraged to be kinder to each
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.820]   other, especially to the tourists.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:54.600]   We live in such a transactional world.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.960]   Let's be kind because then more people will like us, then they will spend more money and
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.840]   that will help our economy grow.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.600]   The world that Jesus spoke about was the opposite.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.360]   This is not how the kingdom of God operates.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.840]   This is not how we should approach our relationship to the poor or those in need.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:24.520]   So when we realize we do not deserve anything and yet God gave everything, that should want
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:34.440]   us to respond in generosity towards each other for no expected return.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:45.160]   Whether we have plenty, whether we have less, we are all able to lead this city and show
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.960]   because we represent God's way.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.080]   And how can we practically respond to this message?
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.320]   What does it actually look like when we leave this place?
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:04.600]   Well back in Easter, my family and I, we went to Taiwan.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.080]   We had a couple of days in Taiwan and we were in this particular place one day where we
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.480]   had been dropped off and we were looking around a village and we had to then get back to the
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.240]   car that was picking us up at a certain time.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:24.560]   It was a really, really hot day and part of getting back to the car involved walking up
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.680]   a very, very, very, very steep hill.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.080]   It probably is about a 10 minute walk up.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.120]   And as I say, it was very, very hot and it was also busy.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.560]   There was a lot of people around.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.760]   And I'm there with my son.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.480]   My son is 16 and we're walking up on a time.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.680]   We've got to get to the car.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.360]   And I'm saying to myself, "Oh, I'm so hot, so hot.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.280]   Come on, we've got to get there, got to get there."
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.680]   And in front of us, there is this grandma.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.920]   She must have been like late 70s, early 80s.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.320]   And she's pushing a push chair with a four-year-old in it.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.640]   And she's like pushing it up the hill like this.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.480]   And it's hot.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.920]   And I'm looking at her thinking, "Oh, no.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.440]   This must be really hard for her.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.040]   She's got to push that child all the way up the hill."
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.360]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   My son, my son is tall and strong.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.360]   He walks in front.
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.600]   As he's walking, he looks.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.120]   And with his hand, he grabs the front of the push chair.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   And he starts to pull the push chair up the hill.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.760]   And the grandma is like, "Oh, thank you, thank you,
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.360]   thank you so much."
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.880]   And the toddler is so excited.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.320]   And I watched my son and I thought, "Wow."
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.280]   I was in the same situation.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:02.720]   And my response was, "Oh, that's going to be tough for her."
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:07.800]   My son's response was action.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:12.560]   And afterwards, when I said to him, "How did you even
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.040]   think about doing that?"
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.440]   I was like, "I'm so proud of you."
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.880]   And he was like, "Hmm."
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:26.960]   And that is how we make a difference in Hong Kong,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.920]   where we choose to see the people around us,
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.120]   and where we choose to act differently,
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:43.160]   where we choose to allow what God has done for us to propel us
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.480]   in many different small and large ways where we can make
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.640]   a difference.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.800]   We all are known and loved by God.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.960]   The sacrifice on the cross is evidence.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:03.200]   It is evidence that God loves us all.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.280]   The desire for him to be in relationship with us should
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:15.080]   propel us to love others as he asked us to do.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:21.760]   So I leave you today with a very simple question and challenge.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:28.360]   Who is on your doorstep, and what are you going to do
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.200]   for them?
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   Would you stand with me as I pray for us?
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.520]   And as we enter into a time of response,
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.480]   the song "Chosen," I believe, is a prophetic word for us
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:52.760]   to sing because it talks about having God fill our hearts so
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.880]   that we will lead out of God's love
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.720]   and that we would see those around us
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:05.040]   and respond out of love to those around us.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.760]   May this message not just be--
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.200]   well, that was a nice message, or not, whatever.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:17.400]   May this message, with the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.640]   transform us as a church.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:27.240]   May we, the vine, be known for our good deeds, our kindness,
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.040]   our generosity, not because it's a good thing to do,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.080]   but because of the power of the Holy Spirit working through us.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.640]   That transforms a city.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:46.760]   So Father, as we stand here now, as we ask for your Spirit
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:54.800]   to empower us to live a life where we can bring change,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.720]   where we can be countercultural at times,
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:05.640]   where we embrace the value system of the kingdom of God,
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.120]   I pray for the Lazaruses in this room
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.480]   right now who don't feel known, but they are known.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:17.080]   And I speak that over you, are known.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.240]   God knows your situation.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.760]   He knows exactly what you need.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.400]   And I pray that you would be filled
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.160]   with the comfort and the presence of the peace of God
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:33.640]   if you leave this place knowing that you are seen by God.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.200]   I pray for our young people.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   I thank you that they are a witness to us.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.200]   And I pray that you empower our young people
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:51.040]   to see the needs around them and to simply show and lead
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:57.720]   the way of what it means to love and care and be kind to others.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.240]   May we learn from them.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.200]   For us, Father, as we leave, as we
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:10.600]   look at who you have placed on the doorstep in front of us,
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:16.280]   may we not walk by, but may we take action.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:21.680]   And may you break our heart for what breaks yours.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.440]   We pray all of this in your name, Jesus.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.000]   Amen.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.580]   (gentle music)
