[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100]   - Amen, hey church, it's such a privilege to be with you
[00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.200]   as it is every week and just to be a part
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.700]   of what God is doing amongst us.
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.760]   And I just wanna echo Carla's words from earlier.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.240]   You know, it's been a really difficult week in Hong Kong.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.620]   It's impacted all of us in different ways.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.480]   And we're standing with you, we're praying for you.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.000]   We wanna walk together in this season and in this hour.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And I do hope that you know that amongst the brothers
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.460]   and sisters of faith, you have a community
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.560]   that's cheering you on, no one is alone, no one is isolated.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560]   We're all part of one family together.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.600]   And that's the joy of being able to do this together.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.720]   To listen to God's word, to encourage each other
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   and to see what God's gonna do amongst us.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.720]   And I'm really excited about that today.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.240]   I wanna tell you a little bit as I start
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.780]   about my experiences as a young Christian.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.000]   You know, for a number of years
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880]   when I first became a Christian,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.040]   I was really skeptical about the more charismatic
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040]   expressions of the Christian faith.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.000]   In particular, I was very skeptical about speaking in tongues.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.400]   I actually came to faith
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.600]   when I was studying philosophy at university.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.440]   And I was somebody who prided themselves
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   on rational thinking.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.320]   I saw the world actually through the lens,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.960]   through the framework of rationality
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.640]   that actually debate and understanding
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.800]   and rational things were important and true.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.320]   And that in order to really understand things,
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.520]   we needed to see the facts.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.000]   We needed to understand things
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.040]   with our rational minds and brains.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.400]   So therefore, as a younger person,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   I was pretty sceptical of emotional people,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.320]   particularly sceptical of emotional people at church.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.360]   I thought emotional people at church
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.320]   were just kind of going through the motions
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.480]   or just kind of being a bit strange.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.360]   And that actually the only way that we truly come
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.880]   to understand the power of God is through our minds,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.160]   through how we think.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.200]   And that theology and rationality
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.580]   was the most important thing.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.300]   This was actually a bit of a problem for me
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.920]   when I graduated university,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.360]   came back to Hong Kong and joined the Vine.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.200]   'Cause the Vine, as you know, is a charismatic church.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.800]   But back in those days, I would say on Sundays,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.960]   our charismatic expression was even more than it is today.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.480]   It was quite regular back in those days
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.800]   that during worship,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680]   somebody might get slain in the spirit.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920]   That's falling down on the ground
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.720]   through the power of God's spirit.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.800]   A lot of people would pray out loud
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   or sing out loud in tongues.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.300]   I remember this one particular week,
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.200]   and this is etched in my memory forever.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.440]   This one particular week, this older lady in our church,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   she crowed like a rooster for five minutes during worship.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280]   Everybody else was completely uncomfortable
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.520]   with the reality that this lady, bless her,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.040]   was crowing like a rooster.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.180]   And so we had some pretty strange things taking place.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.600]   And I have to say, I was very uncomfortable with it all.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.760]   It didn't sit well with me.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.320]   I believe that God didn't bring chaos into the church,
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.340]   that the church was a place of safety,
[00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.960]   of comfort, of security,
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.440]   that we came to church to feel like that.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.560]   And that in those moments in worship,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.680]   I wasn't comfortable for me.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.920]   And I felt like God wouldn't be a part of something
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.280]   that was chaotic like it was.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.260]   Well, there was this one particular Sunday
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.560]   where things were particularly frustrating and bad.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.880]   On this particular Sunday, actually,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.420]   I was standing right behind in the row,
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.720]   right behind of that old lady who had crowed like the rooster
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.920]   just a few weeks before.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.800]   And I'm standing right behind her and worship is starting.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.160]   And I can tell she's getting set to do something,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.640]   some sort of animal noise
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.080]   I knew was gonna come out of this woman.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.240]   She started to shake back and forth.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.760]   She started to kind of do this.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.400]   And I was just preparing myself
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.800]   for the eruption that was to come.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.560]   And I was kind of frustrated by it all,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.400]   if I'm honest with you.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.000]   So I just sort of decided I was gonna close my eyes
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.880]   and just try to block everything else out
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.160]   and just try to connect with God.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.740]   So as I closed my eyes,
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.040]   I received what I can only describe to you as a vision.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.380]   It was a vision because even though my eyes were closed,
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.460]   I could see with 100% clarity a picture.
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.760]   And in this picture, it was like a movie.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.320]   And it was like I was suddenly in this movie set.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.380]   And the set was like this dusty street
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.940]   with lots of little narrow alleyways
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.260]   and lots of homes side by side,
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260]   small white houses with flat roofs.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.420]   And I could see these things just very clearly.
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.180]   And I could almost walk amongst those streets.
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.980]   And actually the houses reminded me
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.420]   of the kind of houses that I was seeing
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.080]   in the little pencil drawings
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.560]   that were found in my Bible in those days.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.820]   I knew that this was Israel,
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.500]   that I was seeing some street,
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.660]   perhaps in the old city of Jerusalem.
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.260]   And as I'm looking at this,
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.740]   I noticed that on every doorframe of every building,
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.340]   there is Hebrew words,
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.500]   Hebrew script written over them.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.740]   Now, this was years before I went to Bible school.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.100]   And as I looked at the doorframes,
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.220]   I could see the Hebrew and immediately I could read it
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.580]   just as if it was English.
[00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.300]   I knew exactly what it was saying.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.580]   The words over every house was this,
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.180]   it's time to come home again.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.320]   It's time to come home again,
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.260]   written over every single doorframe of every single home.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.180]   And I could read it just like I say,
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.260]   just like it was English,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.420]   like it was my own language.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.580]   And as I'm reading the Hebrew,
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.340]   knowing exactly what it means, not only that,
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.380]   but also knowing how to pronounce the word,
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.420]   if I was gonna say it.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.860]   This all happened like just immediately.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.820]   I also found in me the Spirit of God
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.700]   just working towards me a place of peace and shalom,
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.580]   like this place of being right where I needed to be
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.740]   with God in that moment.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.300]   And I knew that the words over those homes
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.080]   was for that old lady standing in front of me.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.060]   So I, without really perhaps even thinking about it,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.060]   I leaned forward, I put my hands on her shoulders
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.660]   and I start to get this,
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.340]   I start to sing those Hebrew words over her
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.540]   in Hebrew, not in English, okay?
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.220]   I start to sing Hebrew.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.860]   Now that's amazing for two things.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.300]   Number one, I don't speak Hebrew, let alone sing it.
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.180]   But number two, if you know me,
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.560]   if you know me, you know that I don't sing,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.060]   that I do not have a good singing voice.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.980]   So I'm there singing my heart out in Hebrew,
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.580]   a language that up into that moment,
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.020]   I did not know, didn't understand,
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.740]   but knew exactly what I was singing over her
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.940]   in the perfect pronunciation.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.380]   She starts weeping, like deep weeping,
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.100]   like just weeping and weeping and weeping.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.340]   And I keep singing and singing those words.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.960]   It's time to come home again.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.440]   It's time to come home again in Hebrew over her.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.080]   Well, a couple of days later, she reached out to me
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.440]   and she let me know what was going on.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.760]   She had visited Israel many, many times in her life,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.320]   but she had stopped going for a bunch of different reasons.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.720]   And she didn't feel like she wanted to go there anymore,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.880]   but she really deeply missed being amongst the Jewish people,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.840]   even though she herself was not Jewish.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.200]   And as I was singing over her in that church service,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.120]   she knew that God was saying those exact words to her.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.640]   She understood Hebrew.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.680]   She knew what I was singing over her
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.820]   was it's time to come home again.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.760]   Here's an interesting thing.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.320]   There's me, sceptical,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.000]   totally driven by rationality in those days,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.280]   kind of feeling awkward
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.880]   when the Holy Spirit would move upon people.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   And God gives me a vision and I step out in faith
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.080]   and everything in me changes.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.320]   From that moment onwards,
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.960]   I've had a really interesting relationship
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.840]   with the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.960]   Things have shifted and changed in me.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.800]   And while I haven't had visions like that very often
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.280]   throughout my Christian life,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.960]   that moment was a changing moment.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.420]   It was like the breaking down of a barrier
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.520]   that I had put in my mind
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.160]   to what the Holy Spirit actually wanted to do.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.080]   And I realised that so often my customs, my traditions,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.480]   the things that I am comfortable with
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.400]   can become a barrier to the thing
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.560]   that the Holy Spirit might actually want to do.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.240]   As we enter into this final week
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.200]   of our Dreaming Again series,
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.800]   I wanna speak a word today
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.760]   that I believe is important for all of us.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.880]   I think there's a need for all of us
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.840]   to receive a fresh revelation from God.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.920]   The kind of fresh revelation
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.880]   that actually shakes and disrupts and breaks down
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.360]   some of those unhealthy barriers,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   unhealthy customs and traditions
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.520]   that we can sometimes hold onto
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.520]   even above what God might wanna do amongst us.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.560]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.480]   Having some customs, having traditions is fine.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.400]   Okay, here at the Vine, we have a theology,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.080]   a framework of theology, a statement of beliefs.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.320]   You can find it on our website that we believe passionately.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.040]   But here's the reality that I've come to see
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.520]   in my Christian life and experience.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.280]   And perhaps you've seen this too,
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.800]   is that so often we can embed ourselves,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.520]   so often we can embed ourselves
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.960]   in the kind of thinking about our church practices,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.920]   our customs and traditions that we feel comfortable with,
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.520]   that those things actually begin to define
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.120]   how we think about God.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.760]   And so actually it is our customs and traditions
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.200]   and practices that become to shape our theology.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.360]   And when that happens, we're in danger, I think,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   of putting our personal preferences over God's truth.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.040]   And when that takes place,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   I think God so often must step in with a fresh revelation
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.240]   because it will take, like it did for me on that day,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.360]   a profound move of the Holy Spirit to shake us out
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.520]   of some of the entrenched thinking that we can find
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.760]   through our personal preferences,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.920]   our comforts and our securities.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.760]   You see, it's interesting
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.480]   because Jesus understood this deeply
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.680]   when he began his own ministry here on earth.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.360]   He knew that he was bringing a message
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   of the kingdom of God,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.880]   a message that was gonna come and shake things up.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.160]   He also understood that that message
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.700]   was not gonna be very easily received
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.360]   by those that were entrenched
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   in Judaic thinking at the time.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.800]   In fact, right at the start of his ministry,
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.720]   Mark records for us a teaching Jesus brings the crowds.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.040]   I wanna read this to you from Mark chapter two,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.720]   starting in verse 22.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   He says this, "No one pours new wine into old wineskins.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.320]   If he does, the wine will burst the skins
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.920]   and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.320]   No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.360]   I think so often the reality is this,
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.880]   that when it comes to our idea of dreaming,
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   God gives us these dreams and they're amazing.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.920]   And it's like this new wine is being poured into us.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.960]   But here's the reality.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.800]   So often we take the new wine of God
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.080]   and we try to fit it into the old wineskins
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.200]   of our traditions and customs.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.560]   When actually what we need is a new wineskin
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.320]   that is able to retain the new wine that God is giving us.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.720]   See, the reality is this,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.040]   sometimes to move forward in our dreams
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.360]   that God has given us will require
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.880]   a new fresh way of thinking,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.960]   a fresh way of believing that is only possible in us
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.000]   through a profound movement of the Spirit of God.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.720]   That's what we need sometimes,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.360]   to shake us out of how we always have thought,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.920]   how we always have tried to put God into a little box
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.920]   when God actually wants to break forward.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.800]   We put that little metal gate in front of the fire
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.440]   so we protect ourselves
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.760]   'cause we're happy with the God that we know
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.840]   rather than the God that actually wants to show up.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.120]   The one who might actually want to shake us up.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.480]   The one that we actually need to come to set us on fire.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.920]   Again, I feel like for some of you watching this,
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.600]   this is gonna be a word for you in season.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.840]   And here's the reason.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   It's because God has given you new dreams.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.320]   He has, if you will, poured out his new wine,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.560]   but you've been frustrated
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.920]   because you've been trying to fit that new wine
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.280]   into the old wineskin
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.960]   of what you're comfortable with in your life right now.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.680]   And while this might not be always easy to hear
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.380]   when God brings his new wine,
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.480]   it's 'cause he wants to put it in a new wineskin.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.560]   That means some things might need to change.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.960]   That means we might need to be open to fresh revelation,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.160]   fresh way of thinking, fresh way of understanding,
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.600]   fresh way of actually practising our belief and our faith.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.120]   Perhaps even, dare I say, fresh theology,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.120]   fresh ways of truly understanding who God is amongst us.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.260]   I wanna challenge us with this idea
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.840]   of what it is to embrace fresh revelation today
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.600]   by taking us to a passage from the early church.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.400]   It's a passage actually where the early church
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.040]   has this dramatic encounter with God
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.860]   that procures and creates a new wineskin in the church.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.080]   That is the very reason why,
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.440]   if you're watching this right now and you're a believer,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.040]   that you've become a Christian.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.480]   It's because of what God does in this particular story
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.740]   I wanna take you to.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.560]   It's from Acts chapter 10,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.680]   and I'm gonna start reading in verse one.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.840]   I hope you're with me.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.040]   I hope you're awake.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.600]   I believe honestly that God's got some fresh revelation
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.680]   for you today.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.800]   And I wanna pray actually just before I open the Word.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.720]   I wasn't planning to do this,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.040]   but I feel like this is important just to break off
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.360]   any distraction that there might be out there.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.240]   Let me pray for this.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.580]   Father, as we open your Word, we do so with hunger.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.180]   We do so Lord willing to shake off our traditions,
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.840]   to shake off even our religion,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.160]   if it means that we've missed you along the way.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.180]   And Father, we wanna ask for a fresh revelation, Lord,
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.180]   of your power, of your spirit, of your love, of your Word.
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.040]   And I pray you would do this amongst us
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.720]   in such a beautiful way today.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.820]   Let me pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.660]   Everyone says.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.600]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.000]   All right, I wanna read to you from Acts chapter 10,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.600]   starting in verse one.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.520]   At Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.120]   a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.360]   He and all his family were devout and God-fearing.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.920]   He gave generously to those in need
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.480]   and prayed to God regularly.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.840]   One day at about three in the afternoon, he had a vision.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.120]   He distinctly saw an angel of God
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.720]   who came to him and said, "Cornelius."
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.660]   Cornelius stared at him in fear.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.840]   "What is it, Lord?" he said.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.400]   The angel answered, "Your prayers
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.680]   and the gifts of the poor
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.760]   have come as a memorial offering before God.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.280]   Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.920]   who is called Peter.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.800]   He is staying with Simon the Tanner,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.760]   whose house is by the sea."
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.880]   When the angel who spoke to him had gone,
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.600]   Cornelius called two of his servants
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.240]   and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.800]   He told them everything that had happened
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.640]   and he sent them to Joppa.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.580]   Luke starts the story by introducing us
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.120]   to this main character in the story, Cornelius.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.360]   He tells us three quick things.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.840]   He's a Gentile, he's a centurion.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.120]   In other words, he's a Roman soldier
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.720]   that has a hundred soldiers under his command.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.840]   And most importantly, he says he's devout and God-fearing.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.480]   This was somewhat common in the times
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.640]   that Gentiles might have become aligned
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.000]   to the Jewish way of thinking,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.680]   and even perhaps aligned to the worship of the Jewish God.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.440]   A God-fearer was a Gentile
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.740]   who took on the beliefs of the Jewish faith.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.640]   Not perhaps in every way in their life,
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   but perhaps in an openness, as we hear in this story,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   to give money to the poor
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.360]   or to pray to this God from time to time.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.000]   And here we have a picture of Cornelius
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.720]   praying to the Jewish God,
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.440]   and God shows up and gives him a new dream.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.280]   He actually says to him,
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.560]   "Okay, I want you to go to Joppa.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.440]   I want you to get this apostle, Peter, who's a Jew.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.440]   I want you to invite this Jewish man to come into your home."
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.280]   Now on paper, that doesn't seem like a big deal to you and I,
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.600]   but in the first century, that's completely revolutionary.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.040]   We need to understand two quick things in context here.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.360]   The first is this, that actually it was illegal.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.240]   It wasn't right in Jewish thinking for a Jewish person
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.720]   to go into the home and share a meal
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.640]   with a Gentile in those days.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.600]   That was outlawed in the rabbinic law.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.480]   It's really important that you know
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.800]   that there were two types of law.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.480]   There was rabbinic law and Torah law.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.120]   Torah law was the law that was found
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.800]   in the first five books of the Bible,
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.440]   the law that came from God's word himself.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.760]   But there was also rabbinical law.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.000]   Rabbinical law was the law that had grown up
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.240]   through the rabbis over the years
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.120]   as they sought to interpret God's word.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.800]   And rabbinical law, not Torah law,
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.160]   had outruled the idea that a Jewish person
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.520]   could go into a Gentile's home for a meal.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.040]   Now here's the reason why.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.160]   It's because in Jewish thinking,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.920]   there was things that were seen as both unclean and impure.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.800]   Unclean and impure.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.000]   An unclean thing was a Gentile,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.320]   the Gentiles by their very existence,
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.440]   being foreign, being ethnically other from the Jewish people,
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.640]   not under that Jewish covenant,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.540]   not part of the chosen generation.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.600]   They were seen as unclean in God's eyes.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.940]   And if a Jewish person associated
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.880]   with someone who is unclean,
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.040]   while the Jewish person could not become unclean themselves
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.640]   'cause they're under the new covenant,
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.960]   they could become impure,
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.080]   tainted by the unclean person that they were with.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.940]   Think about this in COVID terms.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.680]   This is like a Jewish person becomes a close contact
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.880]   with a Gentile, they have to go in quarantine
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.400]   before they're allowed to be released
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.880]   back into the Jewish community.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.020]   You following with me?
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.840]   That was what was happening here.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.440]   So when God says to Cornelius,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.480]   "Invite this Jewish man to your house,"
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.200]   he's thinking to himself, "Hang on a sec.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.800]   God is asking me to do something
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.440]   that's against the rabbinical law.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.160]   And if I invite this Peter over and he comes,
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.240]   he'll become impure."
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.640]   Like this doesn't make any sense.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.600]   This is God bringing fresh revelation
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.560]   to disrupt the rabbinical law,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.860]   the customs and traditions that had gotten in the way
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.680]   of what he wanted to do.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.420]   Cornelius as a God-fearing devout man says,
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.680]   "All right, Lord, if this is what you're doing,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.280]   if this is what you're gonna say, I will trust you.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.760]   I'll go out and I'll invite this Peter to come."
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.480]   Let's see what happens next.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.880]   Verse nine, "About noon the following day,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.940]   as they were on their journey and approaching the city,
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.760]   Peter went up onto the roof to pray.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.240]   He became hungry and wanted something to eat.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.680]   And while the meal was being prepared,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.200]   he fell into a trance, a vision, if you will, a dream.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.960]   He saw heaven open and something like a large sheet
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.760]   containing was being let down to earth on its four corners.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.480]   It contained all kinds of four-footed animals,
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.360]   as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.960]   Then a voice told him this, 'Get up, Peter, kill and eat.'
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.040]   'Surely not, Lord,' Peter replied.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.380]   I have never eaten anything," notice this,
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.680]   "that is impure or unclean."
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.060]   The voice spoke to him a second time,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.060]   "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.640]   This happened three times.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.640]   And immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.060]   Just like for Cornelius, now for Peter.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.740]   Peter receives a similar vision.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.780]   He's up praying and a vision comes.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.480]   And in that vision, the sheet's let down.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.000]   And it's really important, it says here
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   that he saw all kinds of four-footed animals together.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.320]   Now this is really important because Peter's hungry
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.080]   and he sees all these animals in front of him in this dream.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.680]   And he sees, notice, four-footed animals all together.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.280]   Now in Jewish dietary laws,
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.320]   there were animals that were deemed clean and unclean.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.240]   Clean to eat and unclean not to eat.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.960]   Unclean animals were things like pigs and horses.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.640]   Clean animals were things like cows and chickens.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.340]   You can eat those, but you can't eat what's unclean.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.520]   However, if the clean animals,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.100]   like the cows and the chickens,
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.860]   come into close proximity with the unclean pigs and such,
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.520]   then they became impure and also could not be eaten,
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.840]   even though they were deemed clean to begin with.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.980]   Are you following with me?
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.800]   All right, so what that means is this.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.740]   When Peter's seeing all these animals on this sheet,
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.940]   even though some are theoretically clean,
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.200]   because they're mingling with those that are unclean,
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.420]   they've become impure and he can't eat any of them.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.680]   He's hungry, staring at all these things,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.480]   and he's realising he's not allowed
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.940]   to eat any of them at all.
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.840]   So when God says, "Get up, Peter, kill and eat,"
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.100]   he is totally taken back.
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.820]   This goes against everything he understands
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.400]   about the law of God.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.580]   This goes against everything he would understand
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.360]   that God would ever tell him to do.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.760]   He can't get his head around the idea
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.020]   that God would want him to go and kill and eat something
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.160]   that either is unclean or is impure,
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.200]   which is why he says to God, "Surely not, Lord.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.040]   I have never eaten anything that is unclean or impure."
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.880]   I love this.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.360]   He says, "Surely not, Lord."
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.560]   In other words, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Lord.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.760]   You can't be asking me to do that.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.380]   You can't, because that's not of you.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.000]   That's surely not of your character.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.100]   That's not the box that I've got you in.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.780]   That doesn't fit right.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.580]   I don't want that.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.320]   Surely not, Lord.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.600]   I think the reality is this.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   All of us have a tendency to say, "Surely not, Lord."
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.180]   When God so often moves in a fresh revelation,
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.780]   when he brings a word to us,
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.340]   it's so perhaps different from what we thought
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.900]   our initial reaction surely is, "Surely not, Lord."
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.120]   Particularly when those things
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.320]   go against our personal preferences,
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.280]   the things that we've made,
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.780]   our customs and our traditions and the ways.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:05.860]   See, here's the reality.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.140]   There is a comfort, isn't there,
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.420]   to our customs and traditions.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.620]   We like a no surprises kind of God,
[00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.700]   one who is stable and understandable,
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.380]   one who is relational, who is reasonable, predictable.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.260]   That's the kind of God that we like.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.740]   We like a religion that's nicely tied up
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.980]   with a sweet little bow
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.940]   that helps us to understand everything.
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.020]   We like to have answers, don't we?
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.940]   We don't like uncertainty.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.480]   We like certainty.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.420]   I've noticed that as I've gotten older in life,
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.380]   I want stability and certainty more than ever before.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.860]   I know that I can find myself
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.820]   rooted in my personal preferences
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.820]   as I get older more and more.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.140]   And the reality is this,
[00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:51.940]   that so often when we are entrenched
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.140]   in those customs and traditions,
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.940]   when we're seeking a God that we fully understand,
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.060]   where we try to get out mystery,
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.680]   where we try to get away doubt,
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.580]   when we try to run away from the things
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.340]   that might confuse us about God
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.980]   and try to put God in a little box
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.500]   that we can tie with a bow and fully understand,
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.380]   when that happens, here's the reality,
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:15.380]   so often we find ourselves acting more from a place of law
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.020]   than a place of grace.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.300]   You need to follow with this, church,
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.340]   'cause this is really important.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.180]   So often we find ourselves in a place of law
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.620]   more than a place of grace
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.420]   because law is comfortable.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.380]   Law creates boundaries.
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.100]   Law gives us safety and security.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.260]   Grace is risky.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.900]   Grace shunts us out of the things that are comfortable
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.060]   and puts us in a place of higher risk,
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.700]   of unpredictability, of at times uncertainty.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.280]   And we need to realize that so often
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.220]   we find ourselves like that.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.680]   And here's the reality,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.680]   so often those of us who are comfortable in man's laws
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.880]   are really uncomfortable in God's grace.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.080]   I'm gonna say that again, church,
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.480]   'cause I think that's super important right now.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.200]   So often those of us who are comfortable with man's laws
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.960]   really struggle with God's grace.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.360]   We struggle because God's grace
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.720]   turns some of those things outside of what we're expecting,
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.960]   rips open our customs and our beliefs,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.400]   rips open the things that we have created
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.120]   to help us to feel comfortable and safe and secure.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:26.120]   God's grace is risky by its very definition.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.920]   We're like the elder son
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.000]   in the parable of the prodigal son
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.600]   who can't understand that our father would reach out
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.640]   and bless that person.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.600]   Oh God, I don't understand why you would bless,
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.160]   haven't you seen their lifestyle?
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.600]   Haven't you seen how they live?
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.240]   Haven't you seen the mistakes they've made?
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.160]   Haven't you seen the way they're treating their spouse?
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.400]   Haven't you seen all of this stuff
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   that's going on in their lives?
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.240]   How could you bless them
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.840]   in the same way that you're blessed to be?
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.120]   Surely not, Lord.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.440]   When we find ourselves entrenched this way,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.800]   we really struggle with the reality
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.440]   that God's grace is here.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.560]   And I want you to know this,
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:07.160]   so often Christians are so judgmental towards one another.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.680]   We are some of the worst when it comes
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.120]   to judging one another,
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.360]   to judging our faith based on our actions,
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.980]   judging our churches based on their expressions,
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.720]   judging theology based on denominations,
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.600]   judging who we think should be in
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.480]   and who we think should be out.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.880]   And this is something that God wants to disrupt in us
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.000]   in this time, I believe.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.640]   He wants unity across the brokenness more than ever before.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.080]   And that will take some fresh revelation for us.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.040]   'Cause the sad truth is this,
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.240]   that so many Christians who have been saved through grace
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.840]   end up becoming judgmental through the law.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.900]   So often that takes place for us.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.740]   So often that happens.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.380]   And we need to be shaken where some of our customs
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.820]   and traditions have put our personal preferences
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.460]   over God's truth and His word.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.380]   And this is not just for the church.
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.700]   This is for our city, for our society as well.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.820]   You know, we cry out,
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.620]   surely not, Lord, in society often all the times.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.140]   And we put barriers up between those
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.540]   that we think are worth it
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.580]   and those that we don't think are worth it.
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.160]   And we can see things like racism and in classism
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.680]   and kind of tribalism at work and around us all the time.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.880]   And we can see even our city and our society say things like,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.760]   well, that person's not quite as valuable as that person.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.400]   And our laws and the way we treat one another
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.760]   and the way that things happen
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.880]   can actually put ethnic groups amongst each other,
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.200]   can actually put ethnic minorities
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.160]   against those that might be in a majority.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.660]   And that some get privileged and some don't.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.220]   And we're aware that this happens
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.080]   even here in our beloved city of Hong Kong.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:51.920]   I think we're honest,
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.340]   some of the stuff we've seen in the news this week
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.900]   about how some of our Filipino sisters in this city
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.060]   have been handled is disgraceful.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.020]   We should call out the reality
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.260]   when these things take place.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.940]   I experienced this personally in my life
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.240]   just a few weeks ago.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.500]   My wife and I, along with our helper, Lizelle,
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.940]   wanted to get our booster for the vaccine.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.020]   We'd already been double-dosed
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.460]   and we wanted to get our booster now.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.140]   And so I jumped on the website
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.140]   to be able to sign the three of us up to get boosted.
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.580]   And the cases were increasing here in Hong Kong.
[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.260]   And so we wanted to get it done sooner than later.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.380]   And here's what happened.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.980]   As I filled in the forms,
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.780]   I realized that for my wife and I,
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.820]   I was able to book a time
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.980]   that was just two days after the day that I was booking.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.860]   But for my helper,
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.340]   I wasn't able to book her a time for three weeks.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.180]   Why?
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.060]   Simply because she held a different ID card
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.140]   than what I held.
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.300]   Simply because helpers
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.220]   were not allowed to get vaccinated first.
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.340]   I thought that was disgraceful.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.740]   And the reality is that so often in a crisis,
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.020]   it reveals where our true values are.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:00.860]   So often crisis can show us what's actually inside of us.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.460]   And we need a fresh revelation, not just in the church,
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.160]   but in our city and in society as well,
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   that shakes us out of some of these racist,
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.080]   some of these tribalistic, classist impressions that we have.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.480]   And we need to be grounded again in the word of God.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.000]   New wine into new wineskins.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.080]   You still with me, everyone?
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.800]   Still following with this?
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.120]   Now, this is exactly what Peter needed.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.000]   And that was exactly what Peter received.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.480]   So much so that I wanna show you
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.720]   what he says here in verse 23.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.040]   He says it this way.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.120]   He says, "Then Peter invited the three men
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.800]   that had been sent by Cornelius
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.680]   into his house to be his guests."
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.840]   That sounds again like a very normal thing.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.680]   That is revolutionary.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.800]   Peter is taking three Gentiles
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.640]   into his house to be his guests.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.480]   Why?
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.280]   Because through the dream he had received,
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.120]   he now has a fresh revelation about the heart of God.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.280]   He knows now that God is not seeing Gentiles
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.600]   as unclean anymore.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.880]   He understands that if he's in relationship with Gentiles,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.000]   if he's sharing food and fellowship with them,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.600]   he's not gonna be seen as impure anymore
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.920]   'cause we should not call unclean or impure
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.640]   the things that God has called clean and pure.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.480]   And so he invites them into his house.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.400]   And in fact, later on,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.000]   when he shows up at Cornelius' house,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.960]   he explains why he has done that.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.160]   Let me read this to you from verse 28.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.040]   He says this.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.480]   "He said to them, 'You are well aware
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.960]   that it is against our law for a Jew
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.560]   to associate with a Gentile or visit him.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.680]   But God has shown me that I should not call
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.880]   any man impure or unclean.'"
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.720]   I love this.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.080]   He says, "You know that it is our law."
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.120]   Notice he doesn't say God's law.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.520]   He says, "Our law, our rabbinical traditions,
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   our customs and our traditions
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.120]   has created a barrier ethnically between the ethnic other.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.280]   And it is not right.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.920]   And God has broken in by the power of his spirit
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.200]   to help me to understand that that isn't right.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.160]   And I now know that I shouldn't call anybody unclean
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.560]   or impure that God sees value in, that God loves,
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.440]   that God has created in his image."
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.680]   This is Peter beginning to totally cross over
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.880]   to the other side.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   This is completely new thinking for him.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.840]   So much so that he can sit there in this room
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.160]   and preach the gospel to these people.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.340]   And so much so that this happens.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.680]   Have a look in verse 44 and 46.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.920]   "While Peter was still speaking these words,
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.360]   the Holy Spirit came on all who heard his message.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.320]   The circumcised believers who had come with Peter
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.800]   were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.760]   had been poured out even on the Gentiles."
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.600]   I love that.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.240]   "Even on the Gentiles, even on those unclean ones,
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.120]   even on those ones that we had rejected,
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.640]   even on the ethnically other,
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.240]   the ones that we thought were disgusting in God's eyes,
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.640]   God's spirit has poured out even on them.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.720]   For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God."
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.520]   This dramatically changes everything.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.820]   God does something in their midst
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.280]   that he had never done before.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.000]   Peter sees the Holy Spirit come upon those
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.680]   that up to that point he had seen as unclean.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   This is Peter going from the elder brother to the father,
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.560]   realizing now that he is the one
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.760]   that should throw a party for everyone
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.040]   because God's grace has broken over man's laws.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.160]   That God's grace is always greater
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.940]   than our customs and traditions.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.400]   That God's law has come
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.120]   and he opens his heart to a fresh way of thinking.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.660]   A fresh way of thinking, my friends,
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.880]   that completely transforms the church.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.480]   In fact, this creates a new wine skin for the church.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.280]   And Peter is able to connect vision to mission.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.040]   And from this point, they can take up Jesus' words
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.920]   that says, "Take the gospel, not just to Jerusalem,
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.280]   but to Judea and Samaria and the ends of the earth."
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.080]   That this was Genesis 12,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.040]   the calling of Abraham come to its fruition.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.320]   The idea that, "Oh, look up into the skies
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.960]   and all of these people, the Jewish people,
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.620]   will be a blessing to every nation."
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:15.800]   This is the moment where Peter and the early church
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.520]   finally understood what was on God's heart
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.780]   from right at the beginning of all time,
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.380]   that the Gentiles, anyone, you and me,
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.620]   are able to receive the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.580]   for salvation and life.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.980]   If you're watching this right now,
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.740]   you're not Jewish and you believe in Jesus.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.300]   That's because of this moment right here.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.620]   This moment where the new wine of God's power pours out
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.840]   and the church decides to build a new wine skin.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.740]   Now, it wasn't easy for them.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.860]   In fact, they would have a lot of arguments about this.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.660]   You can read later in Acts 14 and 15
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.340]   about the Jerusalem council and how they wrestled
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.180]   with this new theology,
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.420]   with this new reality of the presence of God
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.380]   poured out on people that they didn't think
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.820]   the presence of God should pour out on.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.620]   It wasn't an easy transition for them,
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.820]   but that transition certainly took place.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.620]   And I want you to see why that transition took place.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.100]   Notice this, track with this.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.180]   See, God gives a dream to two people
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.960]   that causes a dramatic shift in their thinking
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.700]   that breaks down the dividing walls between them
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.420]   through an outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.820]   that changes all history.
[00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:31.220]   Isn't that amazing, church?
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.980]   A dream comes, the dream changes their thinking.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.820]   The change in their thinking breaks down the walls,
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.020]   the dividing walls between them,
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.920]   and that results in the spirit of God
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.800]   being unleashed on earth like never before.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.480]   And the question we've got to ask ourselves
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.960]   when we read a passage like this is simply this,
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   what dividing walls are there still existing in us today?
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.600]   What dividing walls are present for us
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   that the Holy Spirit right here in Hong Kong
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.120]   might by His power want to bring some new dreams,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.840]   some new wine for the old wineskin,
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.320]   new wine that gets placed in a new church,
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.920]   a new people, a new people that are open
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.960]   to hearing God's new word who are saying,
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.240]   "This is the way we now need to live."
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.680]   That these dividing walls,
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.960]   the other that we were once afraid of,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.660]   we're gonna break down those walls
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.640]   because the spirit of God brings unity.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.480]   Where are our dividing walls in Hong Kong right now?
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.760]   I wonder if there's a future where yellow and blue
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.120]   could find unity through the spirit of God.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.400]   I wonder if there's a future where Hong Kong people
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.040]   and mainland Chinese might find unity
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.800]   through the spirit of God.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.140]   I wonder if there's a future here
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:53.220]   where the ethnic minority in our cities
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:58.120]   might be seen with the same value as everybody else.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:03.120]   I wonder if new wine is being poured into new wineskins.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.840]   How can we respond with this fresh revelation?
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.560]   How can we receive it?
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.920]   'Cause if you're listening to this right now
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.040]   and you're anything like me, I'd be like,
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.520]   "Well, this sounds really good.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.960]   I wanna have a Peter moment."
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.080]   Or maybe I wanna have a moment like Andrew did
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.320]   and got that vision and was able to speak in Hebrew.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.640]   Maybe some of you are younger here,
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.880]   got a Spanish test coming up
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.480]   and you're praying for that dream right now.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.320]   I'm with you.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.480]   Okay, how do we position ourselves
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.720]   to receive this from God?
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.240]   Well, I think we see three very quick practical things
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.460]   in the passages that we've just been reading today.
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.400]   The first one is this.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.080]   We have to position ourselves for revelation.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.160]   Position ourselves for that revelation.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.320]   Notice in both Cornelius and in Peter,
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.780]   they were both going about their usual activity
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.720]   and habit of praying.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.020]   And in that moment of prayer,
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.000]   God is able to break in and bring his revelation.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.680]   Notice that not all customs and traditions are bad, right?
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.280]   There are many good and healthy ones.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.440]   And our regular practice of praying,
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.160]   our regular practice of coming before God
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.400]   and relationship with him is exactly part of that.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.860]   Both Cornelius and Peter going about their normal,
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.640]   everyday committed, habitual relationship
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.800]   with God in prayer positions themselves
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.240]   for receiving revelation.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.400]   Some of you are wanting revelation for God,
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.240]   but you're not doing anything practically
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.760]   to bring it about in your life.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.560]   Some of you need to re-engage
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.920]   in a prayerful relationship with him.
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.440]   God wants to bring his dreams,
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.640]   but so often those dreams come when we close our eyes
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.560]   and position ourselves to hear from him.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:39.960]   So first of all, position yourself for revelation.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   Second of all is this, look for confirmation.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.880]   Look for confirmation.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.200]   It blows my mind that Cornelius, the Gentile,
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.380]   and Peter, the faithful Jew,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.940]   receive the same dream from God.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.200]   God is trying to connect the two of them together
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:56.360]   by giving them the same dream at the same time.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.080]   And both of those dreams disrupt the ways
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.000]   in which they traditionally thought
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.300]   to bring them into a new relationship
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.600]   together with new thinking.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.760]   Look for confirmation
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.440]   when God brings a fresh revelation to you.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.860]   Don't just jump out and start acting on it.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.040]   Look for the confirmation that God is gonna bring
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.960]   that that fresh revelation is truly from him.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.480]   And so often that confirmation comes,
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.840]   particularly if it's about repairing any dividing walls,
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.880]   that confirmation will come
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.760]   because God will be preparing that other person
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.380]   to receive also that reconciliation,
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.880]   that crossing over the divide to them.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.000]   And I wanna encourage you to be on the lookout
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.920]   for that kind of confirmation.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.280]   God moves, not just by giving you a dream,
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.520]   but by preparing the people around you for the shift.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.680]   And I believe this is what the Holy Spirit's doing
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.240]   with the church in Hong Kong right now.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.640]   I think he's shifting us.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.960]   He's shaking us up.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.620]   He's bringing fresh revelation around us all
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:58.100]   so that we can begin to truly be the new wineskin
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.060]   that Hong Kong needs in this hour and this time.
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.380]   Here's the third and final thing.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.420]   Look for the fruit of the Holy Spirit to be present.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.140]   We know that we can judge something by its fruit.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.720]   And both here, we have Cornelius and Peter
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.220]   gathered in that room and the Holy Spirit pours out.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.340]   And Peter immediately knows,
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.060]   well, that is the fruit that I need to know
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.980]   that this is truly a work of God,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.240]   that this is truly a move of God,
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.940]   that it's not just my new thinking,
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.880]   it's not just my fresh understanding,
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.020]   but God is truly in this
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.620]   because I can see the fruit of his Spirit in it.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.700]   How do we know that the revelation we received
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.140]   is fresh from God, that it is truly his,
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.220]   that it is confirmed by those around us
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.260]   while we look for the fruit?
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.340]   Does it bring the fruit of the Spirit in our lives
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.980]   and in the lives of those around us?
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.840]   Does it bring more love and joy and peace and patience
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.540]   and kindness and goodness and faithfulness
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.500]   and gentleness and self-control?
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.460]   Because if it does, then we know
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.780]   that this is God's work amongst us.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.540]   We look for the fruit of the Spirit
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.380]   and that helps us to understand
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.500]   that the fresh revelation we have
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.880]   is truly from the source of God himself.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:11.820]   Friends, we need new wine to be poured into new wineskins.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.100]   What that means is a number of things for us.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.860]   It means that we need to be ready and prepared to change.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.580]   It means that we need to be open
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:22.700]   to the ways in which we might need to think differently,
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.300]   to adapt to the times, to let go of some of the things
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.580]   that we had previously held tightly onto
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.520]   so that we can grab a hold
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.080]   of the new thing God is bringing.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.180]   It means that we need to be willing
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.940]   to take a good, hard, honest look
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:41.020]   at some of our traditional customs and practices
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.160]   that we've just always done
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.320]   that are actually creating a dividing wall
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.420]   between us and the other, whoever that might be.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.280]   It means that we need to ask ourselves
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.780]   the difficult question of who is the Gentile to us?
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:01.200]   Who is the one that we think if we spent time with them,
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.700]   we would become unclean, we would become impure,
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.120]   we would be in the wrong?
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.640]   Who is the other that we are afraid of,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.400]   the one that we're not sure about,
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.320]   the one that we try to avoid?
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.640]   Who's become the Gentile?
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.000]   Because perhaps God wants to bring
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.400]   some fresh revelation to us about them.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.000]   One thing we learn from this text above everything else
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.600]   is that there is no human being in God's eyes
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.560]   who is unclean and impure,
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.380]   that there is no one that we should reject,
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.220]   shun, turn our backs on, walk away from,
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.560]   that everyone, as it says in this passage,
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.160]   everyone is treated equitably by God,
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.960]   that God has created us in His image
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.160]   and He loves every single one of us.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.240]   And I think this passage also does this for us.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.560]   It challenges us in this way,
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.240]   that like Peter, we have to realise
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.180]   that in order to learn some new habits,
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.960]   we actually have to, first of all, unlearn some old ones.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   And sometimes the unlearning of the old requires repentance,
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.200]   requires us being honest that we had it wrong,
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.260]   requires us being honest about the dividing walls
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.840]   that our personal preferences had created
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.120]   and around our lives.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.360]   It requires us getting on our knees
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.560]   and saying the rabbinical law, Lord,
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.720]   I had allowed to stand over the Torah law, Your word,
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.560]   that my desires became more important to me
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.620]   than Your true word.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.640]   Perhaps as we close this series,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.400]   as we think about what it is for us to truly dream again,
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.300]   as we receive this new wine of God's dreams,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.720]   we have to say, Lord, I remove that metal gate
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.480]   from in front of Your fire.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.000]   I don't wanna be protected from the things
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.720]   that Your Spirit truly wants to do
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.260]   in and through me right now.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.160]   Lord, I wanna be open to the fresh revelation.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.920]   Lord, forgive me where I've put some dividing walls down,
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.960]   where I've made my personal preferences
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.320]   more important to me than Your truth.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.480]   Forgive me, Lord, where I've come to look
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.880]   at the ethnically other differently,
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.420]   where I've put more value on myself than I have on them.
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.340]   Lord, would You come and bring such fresh revelation
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.420]   that I actually am now thinking
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.920]   about the kingdom of God differently.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.580]   Bring Your Spirit, bring Your power
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.980]   so we can dream the sort of dreams
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.460]   and be the kind of church God wants for Hong Kong
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.140]   in this time and this hour.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.260]   Church, it is time for us to dream again.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:42.260]   May His new wine be poured into our new wineskin.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.360]   Lord, bring Your fresh revelation for each one of us.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.600]   Would you pray with me?
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.320]   Let's pray together.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.040]   Father, we just thank You so much for this truth today,
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.260]   that Lord, You bring at times a new way of thinking,
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:03.280]   a new way of believing that enables us to let go
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.620]   of some of the things that have created barriers
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.300]   between us and the fresh thing that You're doing on earth.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.380]   Lord, I wanna pray that where this might be a reality
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.740]   for many of us watching this right now.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.380]   Lord, I wanna pray that You would challenge us deeply
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.940]   to be open, positioned
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.160]   for Your fresh revelation in this season.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.560]   Lord, would You enable us to unlearn some old habits?
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.500]   Habits that may not be the best
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   for what it is that You're doing at this time.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:44.080]   Lord, would You give us the courage to embrace grace?
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.740]   Lord, would Your grace enable us to let go
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.720]   where we've put our traditions above You?
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.140]   And Lord, I wanna pray, Father, that Your fire would fall,
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.140]   that we would let go of the things, Lord.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.460]   That actually hold us back,
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.320]   that the sparks that we've protected ourselves from
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.980]   that are designed to set fire to our lives, Lord, would come.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:17.400]   Lord, that new wine, Your dreams.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.920]   Forgive us, Lord, while we stuff those new wines
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.320]   and new dreams into the old wineskins
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.260]   of the way that we've always done things as a church.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.120]   Lord, I pray for those that need it,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.700]   that Lord, You would completely revolutionise
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.380]   their thinking about Your Spirit.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:42.480]   That You are good, God.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.320]   That You love us so much.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:49.900]   And Lord, if we've ever put You in a box,
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.180]   or if You're in a box in our lives right now,
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.540]   Lord, would You break out of the box, Lord?
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.560]   Lord, we thank You that Peter and Cornelius
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.660]   were able to allow You to break out of their boxes.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.340]   And in them coming together
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.540]   and the power of the Spirit at work in that moment,
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.260]   the whole church was changed forever.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.620]   Lord, I believe we need another moment like that
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:14.780]   in Hong Kong right now.
[00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:19.140]   I believe we need a pouring out of Your Holy Spirit, Lord,
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.780]   that would shake us out of the boxes
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.080]   that we put ourselves in,
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.100]   so that we might be able to truly bring unity,
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:32.100]   reconciliation and hope to this place in this time.
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.840]   So Lord, come now, bring Your new wine
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.200]   and may it find its fertile soil
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.620]   in the new wineskins of our heart.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.900]   And we thank You for this, in Jesus' Name.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.280]   Everyone says, Amen.
