[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Man, well good morning.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.280]   If you're joining us online, good morning as well.
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.640]   It's good to see everybody back.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.560]   We've enjoyed another week of black rainstorms
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.520]   and crazy weather.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.840]   I know what's going on, seriously.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.640]   It's craziness in the weather,
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.760]   but I'm glad everybody is here this morning.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.360]   See some old familiar faces, which is good as well, right?
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.280]   And so yeah, really good to see friends
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.460]   and family gathered together this Sunday.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.840]   And if you've been walking with us through this summer,
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.060]   we've come to the end of our sermon series
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.900]   in the book of James.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.140]   And the hope and the prayer is that we've been changed
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.900]   and moved and challenged to consider our faith seriously.
[00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.180]   Right, that we've not just been walking through a letter,
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.060]   but we've been letting the words through scripture
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.000]   penetrate our hearts.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.380]   It's a reminder that this life that we claim to live,
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.820]   that faith that we came to have,
[00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.720]   there is no room in scripture for nominal Christianity.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.360]   Right, there's no room for saying I am a Christian
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.900]   and coming on Sunday and worshiping with our hands up,
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.740]   all that kind of stuff, without actually living it out.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500]   Because if we do that, it's just noise.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.460]   It's just a distraction.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.980]   It's almost craziness, right?
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.020]   There's a lot better places you could spend on a Sunday
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.160]   than coming here to this church, if you're not about that.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.500]   But James lets us know, right, that real and pure religion,
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500]   right, that following Christ must make a difference
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440]   in the way we live our lives.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.660]   Right, it has to transform everything that we do.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.140]   It's a transformative kind of faith
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.940]   that Jesus calls us to have.
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.700]   It's an active kind of faith, right,
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.180]   that moves us into deeds and actions and not just words.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.060]   It's a countercultural kind of faith
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.760]   where we're not friends with the world,
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.280]   but we are standing in our friendship with the Lord.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.680]   Otherwise, like I said, all this is just noise.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.740]   Actually, I got some really cool feedback lately.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.060]   One of our teenagers, as he's been walking
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.020]   through the book of James, he's been listening,
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.700]   he's been reading the book of James,
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.300]   I hope by himself as well, he noticed,
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   so in response to what he felt like God's speaking
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.020]   to his heart, he said he was walking down the road one day
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.100]   and he saw someone in need and so he stopped
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.940]   to give some money to this person that was in need.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.440]   And as a result, the person behind him saw
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.520]   what he was doing and they too stopped
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.720]   and gave a little bit of money.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.120]   And the person in front of him turned around
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.560]   and saw what he was doing and also gave
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.940]   that person a little bit of money.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.180]   Right, just a small act of kindness, right,
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.560]   set off a chain reaction in the people around him.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.640]   You see what difference it makes when we actually
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.880]   put some actions behind this faith that we claim to have?
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.440]   It's amazing, it's beautiful.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.680]   But there's one more reason why I felt
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.320]   or we felt like it was important for us
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.640]   to go through this book of James and embrace its challenges.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.960]   And that is because there is an urgency to our faith.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.840]   You see, if you read through the entire letter of James
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.400]   in one sitting, which I highly recommend you do,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.640]   right, you'll notice that throughout the letter
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.460]   there is a pressing, there's a desperation
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.400]   to remind everyone that time is short.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.320]   Right, that Jesus is returning soon just as he promised.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.480]   Right, which is why James is strong in his tone, right?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.240]   We've held no punches back throughout this series.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.700]   He is strong in his tone, it's challenging,
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.200]   but yet there's a deep and tender pastoral heart
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.580]   for the hearers of this letter.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.400]   And the urgency and the reminder that we cannot wait
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.000]   to act upon this, our faith in Jesus
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.080]   must start making an impact right now.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.440]   So once again, read with me as we come
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.640]   to the closing words of this letter.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   Yes, it's gonna continue to be challenging,
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.240]   but at the same time, I hope you know
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   that it's filled by love and the passion
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.660]   and the recognition that there is no time to waste,
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.960]   that our time for our faith to make an impact
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.320]   is indeed right now.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.200]   James chapter five, chapter first one.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   Now, now listen, now listen, you rich people,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.160]   weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.760]   Your wealth has rotted, moths have eaten your clothes,
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.500]   your gold and silver are corroded.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.560]   The corrosion will testify against you
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.640]   and eat your flesh like fire.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.860]   You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.480]   Look, the wages you failed to pay the workers
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.400]   who mowed your fields are crying out against you.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.800]   The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.280]   of the Lord Almighty.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.200]   You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.040]   You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.680]   You have condemned and murdered the innocent one
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.320]   who was not opposing you.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.680]   Told y'all it's not easy.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.880]   Have you guys ever heard the saying,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.400]   it's a bit funny, but I've heard it around,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.120]   money doesn't solve all your problems,
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.560]   but I sure wouldn't mind crying in a Laberghini, right?
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   So, I've never been, if you have a Laberghini out there,
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.560]   okay, good for you, it'll be fun
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.160]   to ride around in one sometime.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.480]   But there is a sense of irony in that saying, right?
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.900]   Because we don't usually associate rich people
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.040]   with things like weeping and wailing and misery, right?
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.400]   Because we feel like they have resources,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.000]   they have everything they need, so why are you sad?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.680]   But when we look throughout scripture,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.480]   throughout the Bible, there is a consistent warning,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.560]   maybe one of the most consistent warnings,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.720]   which goes something along the lines of,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.200]   be careful of how much you focus on money.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   Because God knows it's so easy for our heart
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.640]   and our desires to be drawn to money,
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.940]   and how quickly the love of money has to rob our ability
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.600]   of having affections for the Lord and the people around us.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.240]   And once our distraction to money becomes,
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.960]   once money becomes an idol, that the risk there
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.640]   is that we start to do all kinds of unjust
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.160]   and blasphemous acts to the Lord and to each other.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.920]   Right, this is what we talked about in James chapter two.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.320]   When those who have, those who have the resources,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.000]   refuse to pay any kind of attention to those who are in need
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.080]   instead of just a good, you know, pat you on the back,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.920]   okay, see you later, you go off on your way.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.360]   But I have the resources, I'm not gonna help you.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.680]   The love of money is truly the root
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.920]   of all kinds of evil, scripture tells us.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.680]   So why then are the rich suddenly weeping and wailing?
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.320]   Right, it's because they're suddenly seeing the riches
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.240]   disappear before their very eyes.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.920]   Your wealth has rotted, James says.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.760]   Moths have eaten your clothes.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.040]   Gold and silver are being corroded.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.720]   The corrosion will testify you
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.440]   and eat your flesh like fire.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.880]   You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.800]   You see, the foolish thing about dedicating ourselves
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   to material wealth is because material wealth will not last.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.320]   In the context of James, wealth was often tied
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.560]   to the abundance of produce from farming.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.160]   But what happens when you hoard food?
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.000]   We've done this before, right?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.920]   You go to the supermarket, ooh, avocados are on sale, right?
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.280]   You get like 15 of them and they just sit
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.440]   below your microwave and just wilt and die
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.240]   before you have a chance to eat them, right?
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.280]   When you hoard food, it starts to stink and rot
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.720]   and it becomes useless.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.240]   Clothes too, right?
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.880]   We know when Hong Kong winter is coming,
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   November 5th seems to be the magic date
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.560]   when everybody busts out those winter coats, right?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.000]   An entire bus and empty out all the streets,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.640]   suddenly starts smelling like mothballs, okay?
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.400]   Because they've been in storage, okay?
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.600]   So mothball becomes the scent of the month, okay?
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.360]   But even your clothes, right, no matter how fine they are,
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.880]   no matter what brand they are,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.400]   one day your clothes are gonna become worthless.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.720]   The moth will eat them, those little silver bugs
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.160]   that we get in Hong Kong will chew through them.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.040]   They will become worthless.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.280]   James is saying even gold and silver,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.120]   two metals that are associated with being incorrodible,
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.280]   always holding their value, right?
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.160]   Even one day, gold and silver are gonna become worthless.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.840]   They will corrode and disappear.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.040]   And as we look towards the last days,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.200]   we have to keep this in mind.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.360]   And make no mistake, church,
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.520]   this is, these are the last days that we're living in.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.560]   Ever since Jesus died and resurrected
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.680]   and ascended to heaven,
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.880]   he assured us, he has promised to us
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   that one day I am going to return.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.080]   And when he returns, yes, it's coming back to love
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.200]   and to restore and to redeem,
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.320]   to defeat the enemy once and for all, amen,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.520]   to make all things new,
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.680]   to judge, to put an end to all injustice.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.920]   He's coming, scripture tells us,
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.640]   to judge the living and the dead
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.480]   and to gather those who are faithful to him
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.360]   and welcome them into his kingdom.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.520]   Now, when we talk about this topic, though,
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.320]   it sounds like one of those things
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.120]   that's always threatened,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.280]   but it's never going to happen.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.680]   Right, you know like,
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.160]   if you go to the big department stores like Wing On, right,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160]   there's always, they're always doing
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.280]   a final promotional sale, right?
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.560]   So you go and buy something, it's like,
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.920]   Right, and stuff, you know.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.120]   And then next to it you go,
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.200]   and then it's suddenly like a super big final sale, okay?
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.440]   So you think, okay, this is my last chance, okay?
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.840]   And then you go a few weeks later,
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.880]   it's the last super big, super promotional sale, right?
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.120]   And so, it just keeps going on and on and on.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.960]   It's just a marketing tactic, right?
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.480]   It never actually ends, right?
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.120]   And you realize it's just a big scam.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.720]   They just want you to buy stuff.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.680]   But church, this is not the case.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.960]   This is not what we're talking about here, right?
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.840]   The return of Jesus is not a scam, right?
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.240]   It's not some made up story aimed to keep us on our toes.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.400]   Jesus said it himself,
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.120]   "Keep watch, you do not know on what day or hour even
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.680]   "the Lord will come."
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.760]   And just as Pastor Carla said last week,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.440]   God's economy is not our economy.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.240]   God's timing is not our timing.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.560]   And so therefore, we are called to live
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.280]   as if Jesus will really return at any moment.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.880]   And in these last days before Jesus comes back,
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.400]   in the time where Jesus has already begun the work
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.880]   of inaugurating his kingdom here on earth,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.800]   to making things new, to redeeming his creation,
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.720]   hoarding wealth is the exact opposite
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   of what he has called us to do with our resources.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.520]   When Jesus came back,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.040]   didn't he flip this entire approach on its head?
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.000]   Instead, didn't he say, "Blessed are the poor,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.360]   "for theirs is a kingdom of heaven."
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.440]   Didn't Jesus teach us, as hard as it is for us to hear,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.520]   it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.400]   than it is for someone who is rich
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.160]   to enter the kingdom of God?
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.440]   Wasn't Jesus' words to the rich young ruler,
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.320]   "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions,
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   "give it to the poor, you will have treasure in heaven,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.160]   "and then come follow me."
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.480]   So hoarding wealth doesn't make sense,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.200]   but there's something even worse going on here.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.120]   It's not just that the rich have hoarded all this wealth.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.240]   The bigger problem is they have done it
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.080]   on the backs, on the expense of other people.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.600]   First 4 says this, "Look, the wages you have failed
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.480]   "to pay the workers who mowed your fields
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.600]   "are crying out against you.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.760]   "The cries of harvesters have reached the ears
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.440]   "of the Lord Almighty.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.280]   "You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.720]   "You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.000]   "You have condemned and murdered the innocent one
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.360]   "who was not opposing you."
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.480]   All this wealth that these people have
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   has been created through dishonest and unjust practices.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.440]   Right, and the law, the Levitical law had rules
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.560]   addressing this kind of behavior.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.720]   Deuteronomy 24 says this, "Pay them their wages,
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.760]   "pay the workers their wages, each day before sunset,
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.640]   "because they are poor and they're counting on it.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.880]   "Otherwise, they may cry to the Lord against you,
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.360]   "and you will be guilty of sin."
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.080]   So James is concerned about the attitude
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.880]   and the fact that the rich are not using their resources
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.040]   to help others just as the Lord has instructed us to do,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   but rather they would live selfishly,
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.840]   in luxury, in self-indulgence.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.560]   And James is condemning the fact that we are hoarding wealth
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.400]   where we should use it to help those who are in need.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.440]   And you see, like I said just now,
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.920]   this is one of the dangers.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.640]   When we make money and resources and idol,
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   the danger is we dehumanize image bearers of God,
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.360]   of God's people and his children.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.760]   And while we're enjoying luxury and self-indulgence,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.080]   people aren't even being given what they are due.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.120]   And our eyes and ears become so dull
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.280]   that we're blinded and muted for seeing and hearing
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.280]   those who are crying out, but God sees it all.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.440]   Now we enjoy this thinking.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.240]   We're set, things are good for me.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.160]   I don't have a worry in the world.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.960]   And when we live like this, James says,
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.440]   it's like we're fattening ourselves just to be slaughtered.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.360]   It's almost like a comical picture.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.440]   We are sacrificing ourselves to this worldly God
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.600]   of luxury and comfort.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.000]   We're like the fattened calf, we're like Wagyu beef.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.320]   You know how Wagyu beef, they feed the cows,
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.600]   all kinds of stuff, fatten it up.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.520]   The end result of that cow,
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.360]   while he's enjoying all that stuff, right?
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.200]   So, oh, this is great.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   You know, I'm being massaged,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.960]   I'm being fed all this good food.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.200]   In the end, what's the end of that cow?
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.520]   To be slaughtered, right?
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.560]   And this is exactly what we're doing, James says,
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.440]   when we just indulge in ourselves
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.200]   and ignore the cries of those around us.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.640]   The fate that awaits is slaughter, it's death.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:37.520]   Church, if we make our goal in life,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.800]   if what we want to do with our time in this world
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.200]   is just enjoy as many luxuries as possible,
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.560]   whilst at the same time ignoring the cries
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.920]   of those who are in need,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.480]   Scripture likens it to murdering innocent people.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.160]   And we are condemning ourselves.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.280]   And we sit around thinking, you know, there's time for that.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.880]   I'm gonna get to that one day, right?
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.840]   Right now, you know, I'm here for a good time,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.360]   not for a long time, so I'm just gonna focus on me
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.160]   and do everything what I want to do
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.400]   when Jesus could literally return at any moment.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:21.120]   Brothers and sisters, part of our pure faith
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.080]   means that we cannot live like this.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.440]   We cannot live like we don't want that day to come
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.720]   because we've made life so comfortable for ourselves.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.160]   And in living like the Scripture says,
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.880]   we are greedy, we are undressed, we are ungodly,
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.800]   and it will catch up with us.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.480]   We are condemning ourselves.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.680]   We're preparing our flesh to be eaten like fire.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.560]   But instead, as followers of Jesus,
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.480]   we should be hastening the day.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.680]   We should be crying out to the Lord to return,
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.920]   to make things right.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.120]   We should be crying out for His justice,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.240]   praying for the restoration of creation,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.360]   joining in in God's work in restoring and repairing
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.480]   and redeeming humans to Himself.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.960]   We look forward to the day when sin is no more,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.360]   which means we are tirelessly trying to ensure
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.320]   that we are preparing the way for Jesus' arrival.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.720]   We are preaching the gospel.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.640]   We are reaching out to those in need.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.920]   We are speaking out to those who are facing injustice.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.840]   This is the mission we have at hand.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.880]   And we cannot sit idly by,
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.680]   especially when there are people out there being oppressed
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.280]   and suffering from injustice.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.840]   God's economy is not our economy.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.720]   Jesus came to turn the entire system upside down.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.640]   Karl Barth says it this way.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.200]   "Instead of striving for higher position,
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.400]   "more power, and more influence,
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.200]   "Jesus moves from the heights to the depths,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.840]   "from victory to defeat, from riches to poverty,
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.560]   "from triumphs to suffering, from life to death."
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.480]   Jesus came to say, "Blessed are the poor."
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.760]   And His ears are always tuned to hear the voices
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.000]   of those crying out for justice.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.480]   So we're reminded today, church,
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.800]   that we're here on God's time.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.960]   Just because it hasn't happened yet,
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.640]   don't think that it's not going to.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.800]   And Jesus is returning.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.880]   James reminds us of that.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.040]   And so to end this letter,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   He gives us some instructions on how He wants us to live.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.160]   Taking care of the poor, the widow, and the orphans,
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.560]   doing God's work of justice.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.480]   But there's two more things He wants us to embrace
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.360]   as we look into these last days.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   The two things are this, patience and prayer.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.880]   Patience and prayer.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.680]   Let's look at patience for a minute.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.800]   Firstly, James calls us to be patient in the Lord.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.600]   Now again, in our modern day lives,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.000]   it's almost like the entire idea of patience
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.320]   is trying to be erased from our vocabulary.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.600]   We don't like waiting for stuff.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.760]   Everything is marketed towards the idea
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.480]   that the faster, the more convenient it is,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.840]   the better for us, right?
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.680]   [speaking in foreign language]
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.640]   Right, that's a Hong Kong motto.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.320]   Right, everything is on demand.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.760]   You can order anything you want at any time
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.720]   with the touch of a button.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.000]   You can have food, clothes, anything you want delivered
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.400]   right to your doorstep almost immediately.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.440]   Now, I would be a hypocrite to say
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.920]   I don't enjoy the conveniences of modern life, right?
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.000]   It's great sometimes to have those things available to us.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.080]   But again, the danger is that this way of living
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.600]   robs us and dulls us of how God wants us to respond
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.840]   to how He wants us to live.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.520]   And we forget the value in waiting
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.560]   and having patience in the Lord.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.000]   Waiting on the Lord will always lead
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.120]   to something of great value.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.520]   Every time we wait on the Lord, it's not time wasted.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.800]   It's not doing nothing, but it's trusting
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   that God is doing something
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.960]   and that one day it's going to bear fruit, right?
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.600]   This is why patience is part of the fruit of the Spirit
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.860]   that Scripture encourages us to grow in.
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.920]   That's why patience is a key component of love.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.560]   And when we are patiently waiting on our Lord,
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.240]   it's a sign of the hope and the faith that we have in Jesus.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.440]   James uses a illustration of agriculture
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.920]   to highlight this to us.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.720]   He says this, "See how the farmer waits for the land
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.860]   "to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.040]   "for the autumn and spring rains.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.880]   "You too, be patient and stand firm
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.700]   "because the Lord's coming is near."
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.120]   Again, we go to our wet markets, we go to Welcome,
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.160]   we go to Park and Shop, wherever we like to do our shopping,
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.320]   and we see the rows and rows of fruits and vegetables,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.560]   the meat, everything is right there ready for us
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.320]   just to take to the counter, check out, and take home.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.440]   But next time we go, be mindful.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.360]   The way that produce got there wasn't just magic, right?
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.760]   It wasn't just someone just made them appear.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.320]   It's gone through the time of growing, of tilling.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.160]   There was a farmer or a process, right,
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.120]   that all that stuff had to go through
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:36.260]   in order for it to end up on our supermarket shelves.
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.080]   And there was a person who planted seed and waited,
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.680]   and it seemed like nothing was happening
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.480]   until that plant begins to break through the soil.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.600]   And this is the same for us.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.560]   Whilst we are waiting, while God is calling us
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.320]   to be patient, we're like a farmer.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.720]   We're hard at work, planting seeds, tilling the ground,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.280]   knowing that God is the one who's gonna do the growing,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.080]   and that in due time, we will reap a harvest
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.400]   to collect in God's name.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.760]   So we are patient in the Lord.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.200]   But James also tells us this.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.360]   As we do that, we need to be patient with each other.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.320]   Don't grumble against one another, he says,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.480]   brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.320]   The judge is standing at the door.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.600]   Another danger we face as a community
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.800]   as we wait for God to return
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.960]   is that we start to get impatient.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.640]   And when we get impatient, it's easy to start complaining
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.440]   and grumbling and attacking each other.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.600]   Remember what Andrew said a couple of weeks ago
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.800]   when we need to, the fact that we need to watch our tongues?
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.840]   When we get impatient and grumble,
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.800]   we tend then to speak words that are unkind, right?
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.120]   Words of death rather than words of life.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.080]   And in these last days, this is what Jesus
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.360]   is looking after for.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.080]   He's especially concerned about his people and his church.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.440]   But when we grumble against each other,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.400]   when we fight and we quarrel,
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.480]   we cannot be the unified body of Christ
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.080]   that he has called us to be.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.800]   We cannot be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.960]   When we're busy attacking each other,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.000]   how can we be that voice that speaks out
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.480]   for the innocent and those who are suffering injustice?
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.280]   When we're so caught up with the splinter
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.880]   in each other's eyes, how can we see the evil
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.600]   that is happening around us?
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.840]   This is why James reminds us, right?
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.600]   Don't think just because we're not like those rich oppressors
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.220]   that he was talking about at the beginning,
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.060]   that God isn't coming to judge us either.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.600]   We should be speaking and acting as if Jesus
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.700]   was right at the gates, right at the door.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.360]   Maybe even imagining him putting his ear against the door,
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.880]   seeing what's happening inside.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.500]   Any time to open the door.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.560]   And when he does enter, how is he gonna find his church?
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.880]   How he's gonna find his people?
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.600]   Fighting and grumbling or steadfastly and patiently
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.940]   doing the work that he has called us to do.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.940]   And finally, James calls us to also be patient in suffering.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:23.260]   Because the call to patience here isn't the kind of patience
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.920]   just enough just to wait for a few extra minutes
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.240]   for a coffee to be made.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.800]   The patience that God is looking for
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.220]   is the steadfast kind of patience
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.720]   that even when things aren't going our way,
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.100]   we hold on to his promises.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.480]   Even in the toughest of situations.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.240]   And to make his point, James asks us to consider the prophets.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.160]   Consider the prophets and the things they had to go through.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.280]   Now I both love and I'm terrified by the fact
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.640]   that James tells us that we need to be patient in suffering
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.080]   and then he turns us to the prophets.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.960]   And even though he doesn't mention any prophet
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.360]   in particular by name, if you read through
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.320]   the Old Testament and the things the prophets
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.840]   had to go through, right, they had to suffer
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.000]   through all kinds of stuff in God's name.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.420]   And in fact, it was often God himself
[00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.820]   who calls his prophets into seasons
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:18.980]   of perseverance and suffering.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.260]   Look at Jeremiah for a second.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.100]   Jeremiah was a man of God.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.760]   But this man of God endured constant persecution,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.500]   ridicule, and death threats all through his ministry.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.200]   Everybody mocked him.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.580]   Everyone was trying to convince him to shut up,
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.260]   just denounce God, stop talking about it.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.920]   But even when he himself tried to shut up,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.540]   he said this, these were his words.
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.580]   His word in my heart is like a fire,
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.980]   a fire shut up in my bones.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.380]   I'm weary of holding it in.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.580]   Indeed, I cannot.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.580]   Right, this quote sounds cool and we like it, you know.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.940]   But this was Jeremiah speaking out of a place
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.920]   of desperation.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.700]   This was Jeremiah saying, I'd rather be doing anything else.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.900]   Do you know the amount of stuff I've been through
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.020]   as I speak God's name?
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.460]   I would rather be doing anything else
[00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.920]   than speak God's word that he tells me to.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.840]   But yet he chooses to anyway.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.940]   And he patiently suffers and endures
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:25.180]   even though he knows the positions it's gonna land him in.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.900]   Take Ezekiel, right, doing something
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.540]   that made no sense to anyone.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.300]   God told him to lay on his side for 390 days
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.100]   in an illustration to God calling him
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.220]   to demonstrate how many days Israel
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.500]   had been lost in their sin, right?
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.500]   Lying down on his side, 390 days,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.220]   just lying there like that, right?
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.740]   I don't know if you'd be patient enough to suffer that.
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.620]   Take Hosea, who had to patiently endure his wife
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.720]   running off to other men time and time and time again.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.320]   Yet God kept telling him, you have to keep loving her.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.100]   You have to keep pursuing her.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.220]   Never, do not leave her side.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:10.360]   God uses us in patient suffering.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.860]   So if you're suffering for Jesus right now,
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.620]   take heart, you are not alone.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.380]   You are never alone.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.860]   And in the meanwhile, know that your character
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.500]   is being forged through these seasons of difficulty.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.700]   God uses it to transform us.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.860]   Back in chapter one of James, he says this,
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.180]   blessed is the one who perseveres on the trial
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.720]   because he has stood the test.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.500]   That is the person who will receive the crown of life
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.700]   that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:51.300]   As we remember these things, as we practice patience
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.520]   in the Lord with each other in our suffering,
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.380]   remember this too, that the Lord
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.900]   is full of compassion and mercy.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.580]   See, as we look through these things,
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.340]   it might seem like God is this angry and fiery judge,
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.140]   itching to come back so he can show everybody what's up.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.800]   That's not his heart, really.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.420]   And time and time again, more often than not,
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.540]   scripture reminds us that God is full of mercy.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.840]   He is full of compassion, that his love is everlasting,
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.260]   that his blessings go beyond a thousand generations,
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.940]   that he sacrificed his son in order to show us his love.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.900]   And ultimately, his nature is not to punish and to slaughter
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.140]   even though that is a consequence,
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.620]   but it is to bless and to love.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.020]   So when we're patient in the Lord,
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:52.500]   the result is always to come into his blessings in our life.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.520]   Now, those might come in all sorts of ways.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.200]   I'm not saying prosperity gospel here,
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.140]   don't hear me wrong, okay?
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.020]   But what I'm telling you is this,
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.160]   in all the suffering that we have to go through
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.180]   in the name of Jesus, if we persevere,
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:12.120]   if we keep our faith in him, he will restore you,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.400]   he will come through for you in his will,
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.580]   in his way, and in his time.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.480]   So we hold on to patience, church.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.840]   And one thing we cling on to in this journey of patience
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:33.000]   is prayer, we have to have prayer.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.420]   Prayer is like one of those immovable building blocks
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.760]   of our relationship with Jesus.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.320]   Prayer is one of those amazing privileges
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.900]   that we get as the children of God.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.480]   But if we're honest, prayer is also a bit of a mystery,
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:52.480]   because it's hard to fully understand how it works.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.440]   When you try to explain prayer to someone
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.720]   without any kind of faith at all,
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.280]   it might sound like some sort of ramblings of a mad person.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.920]   People might think you're crazy.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.160]   You're talking, what are you, talking to a magical sky fairy,
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.800]   you just whisper your wishes into the air,
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.640]   and you're just hoping that something's gonna happen,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.520]   somehow it's gonna make a difference.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.720]   Well, even in secular culture, so that's one side of it,
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.640]   but on the other side of it, for people
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.040]   who don't have a faith in Jesus,
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.960]   maybe sometimes prayer seems like
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.360]   some sort of cosmic slot machine.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.280]   So you launch a prayer into the sky,
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.360]   and it's like pulling a wheel and pulling a handle
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.040]   to see if you come up with a jackpot.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.880]   Oh, ding, ding, ding, yes, my prayer's got answered
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.440]   this time, right?
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.600]   Or you just throw a prayer,
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.340]   Bon Jovi has a whole song about it, right?
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.840]   You're living on a prayer, right?
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.600]   You see what happens, I'm just gonna say these words,
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.420]   but I don't know who it really is going to,
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.660]   I'm just gonna hope for the best.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:50.660]   James gives us no room to doubt the power of prayer
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.020]   and the absolute essential role it plays
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.560]   in our relationship with Jesus.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.260]   And we have to pray in all circumstances,
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.460]   in all situations.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.820]   He says, "As if you are in trouble,
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.080]   "is there anyone among you in trouble?
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.860]   "Let them pray.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.680]   "If you are happy, let them sing songs of praise.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.440]   "If anyone among you is sick,
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.960]   "let them call the elders of the church to pray over them
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.680]   "and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.520]   "And the prayer offered in faith
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.100]   "will make the sick person well.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.180]   "The Lord will raise them up.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.380]   "If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.500]   Right, what a beautiful contrast this is
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.980]   from the type of community we started the message with.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.620]   Right, in the beginning, we saw people out for themselves,
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.300]   living in indulgence, you know,
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.460]   and being unjust to each other.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.380]   But James is letting us know that when we're able
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.860]   to put the material things aside,
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.460]   when our focus and our heart's desire is made right,
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.020]   not to abuse and take advantage of each other,
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.980]   but rather now the focus becomes on ministering
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.340]   to each other, to loving each other,
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.780]   to praying for each other, to making sure
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.220]   that we're taking care of the sick,
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.620]   of offering prayers of faith.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.060]   This is the kind of church Jesus is looking for.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.540]   This is what it looks like when heaven meets earth.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:16.500]   This is what it means to bring hope to this world.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.560]   Because when we pray church,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.520]   we are not talking into thin air.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.960]   Prayer is not a cosmic slot machine.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.680]   When we pray church, we are giving our petitions
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.040]   to the King of Kings, the all-powerful, all-merciful,
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.640]   all-loving God who loves everybody,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.120]   the one who is able to do all things.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.740]   This is precisely why prayer works,
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.700]   because God is who he says he is,
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.760]   because he is close to us.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.740]   And this is why when we pray,
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.180]   we can have one foot in the mess and the craziness
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.920]   and the suffering that we all have to face in life,
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.340]   but the other foot knowing full well God is who he says he is
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.340]   and that he is good, he is merciful, he is just,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.820]   he is there for us in our time of need.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.160]   We stand firm on his promises when we pray,
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.140]   no matter what we are facing.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.920]   If we're in trouble, we can pray.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.000]   If we're happy, we can pray.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.360]   We sing these songs, we pray this way
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.680]   because we know who God is.
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.720]   But there's one more component about prayer
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.900]   that makes it even more beautiful.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.600]   And it's the reason why we're sitting gathered
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.620]   here today, it's the reason,
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.460]   it should be the reason why you're coming
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.980]   every single Sunday to a gathering like this.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.600]   It should be the reason why you're gathering
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.540]   in your community groups or your friendship groups.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.940]   It's because prayer isn't just you and the Lord.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.060]   Prayer is something that God wants us to do
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.860]   as a community, together, as brothers and sisters,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.380]   as family, right?
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.020]   And this is one of the wonderful things
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.100]   about knowing Jesus and being part of his family
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.880]   is that we can count on other people
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.000]   to pray for us as well.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.740]   James says here, "If you're sick, call the elders,
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.400]   "the faithful, the righteous people to pray for you."
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.600]   And let me tell you, church, that our elders
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.780]   here at the Vine are faithful and righteous people.
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.040]   The colleagues I have the honor to work with
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.300]   are faithful and righteous people.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.360]   So this is a part of the Bible we can take literally.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.800]   If you are sick, if you are in need,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.980]   call us, we're here for you, we want to pray for you,
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.140]   we want to hear what you're going through.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.180]   Come and pray in faith with us,
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.900]   and we will pray, and we will ask God in faith,
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.820]   we will bring your petitions before God
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.300]   and allow his will to be done.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.860]   But I also want us to hear this as well,
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.780]   and really hear this, right?
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.620]   Praying for each other in this way,
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.980]   it's not just reserved for the leaders and the elders
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.300]   and the pastors of this church.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.840]   But every single person who has a faith in Jesus
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.760]   has the right, has the access,
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.960]   I would even say has the responsibility
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.580]   to do this for each other.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.460]   But we saw a beautiful example of this
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:19.140]   last week at the 11 a.m. service,
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.640]   when Linda came forward in faith to receive prayer,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.960]   and in response, we as a church prayed in faith
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.480]   for her healing, right?
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.740]   I don't know about you, but to me,
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:32.480]   that was a beautiful reflection
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.420]   of what the church is for.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.600]   And I'm honest, like last week,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.360]   what happened was not planned at all, right?
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.880]   During the 9 a.m. service, I was worshiping,
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.000]   and I was praying, and I heard the Lord say to me,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.580]   "You need to give people the opportunity
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.000]   "to come forward and receive prayer,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.360]   "'cause there's someone out there
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.840]   "who is in need of prayer right now."
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.420]   So it was just a simple response of obedience
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.840]   to call for prayer from the church to someone in the church.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.880]   And it was beautiful.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.360]   It was amazing moment in the life of our family.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.000]   Now, could you imagine, church,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.040]   how much more would things change
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.560]   if everyone in this room was dedicated
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.220]   to praying for each other,
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.740]   even outside of this space on Sunday,
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.680]   that constantly we're practicing our faith in this way,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.940]   praying for healing, praying for miracles,
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.120]   praying for God's power to break through,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.160]   praying for our city, praying for our families,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.520]   praying for the world.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.400]   The effect of this would be universe-shaking, church.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.200]   And this is what James is talking about.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.400]   He gives us a little example of Elijah, a man of faith,
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.680]   who prayed that it wouldn't rain, and it didn't rain.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.360]   And then he prayed for rain, and then it rained.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.520]   James tells us this, you see, prayer really works.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.560]   There is an effect.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.300]   We're not talking to nobody.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.740]   We're talking to our all-powerful, loving Creator in heaven.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:02.160]   We are talking to our Savior when we join voices in prayer
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.900]   and make our petitions known to Him.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.160]   And it's not just physical healing.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.080]   It's also for the healing of souls.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.580]   Prayer has the ability to change our destiny,
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.560]   our situations right here on this earth,
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.400]   but also in the life to come as well.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.360]   And there's a kind of healing that takes place
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.360]   when we pray, because it's able to save us from our sin.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.680]   See, above all things,
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.900]   sin is the most destructive force in our lives.
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:42.040]   And we've all experienced this.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.160]   We go against God's will.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.020]   We take things into our own hands.
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.680]   We go when God says stop.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.320]   We let the lust of our eyes and the desires of our flesh
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.280]   get the better of us.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.920]   We use our words to tear down instead of build up.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.440]   And we fight, we quarrel, we gossip.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.840]   We become friends with the world,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.520]   and we turn our backs to God.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.480]   We have envy and selfish ambition.
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.280]   We show favoritism to people.
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.080]   We ignore the needs of the poor.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.020]   Sin will 100% absolutely tear you apart,
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.880]   tear your relationship with God apart,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.300]   and tear your relationship with other people apart.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.720]   That is the destructive power of sin.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.100]   So what do we do?
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.600]   We pray and we confess.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.880]   James says it this way.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.760]   Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.940]   so that you may be healed.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.260]   And confession is one of those things
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:44.280]   that's become a bit lost because it's scary.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.340]   It is a bit scary.
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.600]   It's hard to confess sin.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.440]   Right, and when we do it,
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.320]   we feel like there's a certain shame that comes
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.960]   because we don't want people to see the mess we're in.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.300]   And so we hide and we don't allow other people to know.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:04.520]   But I think all of us in this room have also felt this too.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.200]   That every time we hide our sin, right,
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.680]   we are actually playing directly
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.880]   into what the enemy wants us to do with it.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.060]   And when we don't deal with sin,
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.040]   we give it the opportunity to grow, right?
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.680]   It's like a mold that just festers in the dark
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.840]   and the longer you don't deal with it,
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.800]   the more it will grow
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.960]   and destroy your relationship with God and others.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.280]   Paul describes it as like a web that so easily entangles us
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.760]   that it was like we're covered in these webs
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.360]   and the more we try to struggle ourselves to get out of it,
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.140]   the bigger the mess we find ourselves in.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.460]   That is what sin does to us.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:44.280]   And James lets us know here, there is a way out.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.140]   One of the ways we deal with it,
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.460]   the way to deal with sin is through confession.
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:53.920]   Yes, it's scary, it's hard to do.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.120]   And I've been in those situations
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.200]   where I know I've messed up
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.860]   and I know I need to open my mouth
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.000]   and admit what I've done wrong,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.180]   confess my sin to those who I've sinned against.
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.600]   And I've been in small groups too
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.960]   where there's been a group of us people
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.320]   that have been walking together.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.600]   And one of the brothers has come up
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   and he's confessed things that he's been losing himself to,
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.780]   sin that he's been wrestling with.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.540]   And yes, there are consequences.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.540]   This is not like a magic eraser,
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.100]   everything makes better immediately when we confess our sin.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.860]   There are consequences to deal with because sin is messy
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.000]   and it does take time to figure things out
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.380]   and pick up the pieces.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.820]   But know this too, church,
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.480]   the end result when we confess
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.640]   is always a step towards restoration and healing.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.300]   And I believe some of us are sitting in this room today
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.680]   and you are suffering greatly because of your sin.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.220]   And you feel like you're in anguish
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.160]   because of where your sin has led you to.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.940]   And you're sick and tired of the power
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.120]   that sin has over you.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.300]   Listen to these words.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.900]   God can free you if you would allow yourself
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.740]   to embrace confession,
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.440]   come alongside a brother and sister,
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.840]   confess your sin with us together in front of the Lord
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.380]   so that you can be healed.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.980]   Now I'm not saying everybody come up
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.460]   and grab the microphone right now
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.640]   and air all your dirty laundry here, okay?
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.980]   That's not the point.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.240]   But it is being honest about where you are.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.620]   It is asking God to help you.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.500]   And it is inviting someone who you trust,
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.900]   someone else who loves the Lord to come alongside you,
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.180]   to tell them what you're struggling,
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.780]   tell them what you're going through.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.960]   I've had this addiction that I can't get rid of.
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.620]   I've hurt people in this way.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.260]   I've been dishonest with my family.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.940]   I've been dishonest in my practices and business.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.720]   Whatever the sin is,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.880]   what would it be like if we had a community
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.380]   that was able, honest enough with each other,
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.060]   that loves the Lord enough, that loves each other enough
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.460]   that we could confess these things freely
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.360]   within our community so that we can find healing?
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.300]   And in fact, I do believe this is something
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.240]   that the Lord has been growing us in
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.300]   as a church of the vine,
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.780]   especially throughout this year, right?
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.180]   We have seen beautiful moments
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.900]   of people gathering together to pray
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.860]   for those who are hurting,
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.180]   to pray for those who are lost in sin.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.380]   We have had moments when sin has been confessed
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.860]   and people have found healing and restoration
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.620]   as a part of that process.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:45.280]   So this is the task at Hand Church.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.100]   Are we willing to do these things?
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.140]   In the light of Jesus returning,
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.740]   he has called us to be an active,
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.660]   a steadfast, a patient community of faith
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:04.040]   that looks forward to Jesus coming back.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.680]   And is tirelessly working to welcome him when he does.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.820]   This is the power of God at work in our lives
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.880]   and in the church.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:21.140]   So the question is, after these five weeks,
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.900]   how should we respond?
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.340]   And time is short.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.100]   We have no time to lose.
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:32.160]   And James has called us to a genuine, active,
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.880]   righteous, loyal, and prayer-filled faith.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.200]   Will we respond to this church?
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.940]   If you would close your eyes for a second
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.180]   and just allow the Lord to speak to you right now.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:54.940]   You know, and over the past five weeks,
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.260]   perhaps God has used different parts
[00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.300]   of this series to talk to you.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.660]   Maybe it was in a moment of worship.
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.720]   Maybe it was in the prayer line.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.740]   Maybe it was through one of the messages that we've heard.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:25.320]   And the Lord loves us too much not to leave us
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.420]   with instructions and his desires for us.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.000]   (gentle music)
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.300]   And so Jesus, I pray that as a community,
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.120]   that we would encourage each other in this way always.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.660]   That you would keep our minds and our hearts fixed on you.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:54.620]   That we would always be a voice that cries out
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.720]   on behalf of those who have no voice.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.300]   (gentle music)
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.800]   That we would always be steadfast in our faith.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:09.480]   Not double-minded, not hot and cold,
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:17.580]   but fully focused and sold out completely
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.180]   to your love at work in our lives.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.000]   That the way we speak of each other
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.220]   would always be honoring and uplifting.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:34.620]   That our loyalty to you is true,
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:38.220]   even when we face the temptations of this world.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:45.560]   And that we are patiently waiting,
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.920]   actively working towards building your kingdom
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.080]   here on this earth.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.580]   Jesus, we know you hear our prayer.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:59.420]   And so Father, help us in this journey.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.700]   And until we see you again face to face, Lord,
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.020]   guide us and lead us in your love.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:10.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:20.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
