[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   - Good morning, church.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.460]   It's good to see you.
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.300]   I know there's a lot of you watching from different places,
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.420]   so I know you're there,
[00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.040]   and so thank you for joining us this morning.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.480]   Church, I want to start by recapping our last two weeks
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.800]   from the Advent series.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.560]   In week one, we talked about the call
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.940]   and that there's 400 years of silence,
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.020]   people's hearts got hardened,
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.640]   and no one expected Jesus to come, but he did.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.040]   And Andrew focused on the call of repentance,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.840]   which is a call to turn around,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.460]   to reorientate yourself in a new direction,
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.440]   and it speaks more of action
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.940]   and more than just a confession.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.600]   And John the Baptist shows us that Advent is a call
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320]   to personal renewal as well as social reversal.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.340]   Last week, which you probably remember,
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.880]   we talked about this beautiful place called the desert,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.920]   and we focused on the wilderness
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.080]   and how that it plays a central role
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.720]   in the Old Testament biblical narrative,
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.840]   and this is where God most revealed himself to his people,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.040]   and he did it through a process in the wilderness
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.000]   through intimacy, through teaching, and through healing.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.340]   Also, we just dwelled on the fact that Advent is a time
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.320]   for us to redefine our own wilderness,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.020]   from a place of isolation to a place where we can meet God.
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320]   And we must remember that this is the coolest thing,
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.880]   that there is fruit in the desert,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.160]   and that God will stop at nothing in our wilderness
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.160]   to shape and refine us so that we could be fully alive in him.
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.320]   And so before I start, I have a disclaimer to make.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.440]   Although we are gonna be talking about baptisms,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.880]   my intention, for those of you who are already baptized,
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.160]   whether in November or you got baptized earlier,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.360]   I do not wanna cause any one of you to second doubt
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.120]   or second guess your baptism, right?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.160]   The fact that you got baptism, that's good.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.840]   Now, for those of you who have not gone baptized yet,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.400]   every year we run a few courses throughout the year
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.720]   where you can learn more about baptism,
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.200]   and hopefully it'll help you make an informed decision
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.800]   on whether to get baptized or not.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.840]   So there's more information on that.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.100]   So in the last two months,
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.660]   I've been preparing to share with you today,
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.200]   and three things came to mind
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.000]   that I wanna bring to your attention,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.920]   and these things hinder our faith and hinder our growth,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.000]   and they are distractions, they are hurries,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.880]   and they are desires.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.280]   And so I just want you to reflect
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.720]   on whether these things impact your faith or not.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.800]   So church, I wanna ask you,
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.680]   how often do you get distracted from what you need to do
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.440]   and are called to do?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080]   Think about Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.160]   and how many times did Jesus have to ask his disciples
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120]   to stay focused and to just pray with him?
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.280]   Because often there is so much going on,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.460]   not just externally, but internally in us,
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.080]   that our hearts and our focus gets divided.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.000]   Let me ask you another thing.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.600]   How often are you hurrying from one thing to another,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.200]   one place to another, from one conversation to another?
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.280]   Lately I'm realizing that hurry
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.880]   is one of the greatest enemies to our spirituality,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.280]   because we simply cannot do what Jesus asks of us
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.960]   in a hurry.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.540]   We cannot follow him to a quiet place in a hurry.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.640]   We cannot build meaningful relationships in a hurry.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.620]   We cannot listen to what God wants to say to us in a hurry.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.640]   And lastly, I want you to think about this, church.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.880]   How often do you experience a perpetual restlessness
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.580]   within your heart that you can't get rid of?
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.940]   As humans, we have desires, and they drive and motivate us,
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.520]   and we get stuff done, which is great.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.920]   But the tension arises when we realize
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.720]   that we're actually finite beings.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.180]   That means we have limitations,
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.180]   but yet our hearts desire infinitely so much stuff.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.200]   And what happens then?
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.760]   We experience this thing called restlessness.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.800]   We can't stay still, and no matter how much we see,
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.680]   no matter how much we do, buy, sell, eat, drink,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.280]   experience, visit, travel, we always want more.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.840]   We can't seem to satisfy that.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.680]   And we do try to satisfy that.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.200]   We try to manage that ourselves,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.600]   but then we're led down this path of more anxiety,
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.440]   of depression, of burnout, of materialism,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.260]   of sin, idolatry.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.780]   We form these unhealthy habits and attachments to things,
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.020]   all as a way of us trying to address our restlessness
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.400]   that actually only God can satisfy.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.040]   And we continue to spiral
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.520]   unless we encounter some kind of intervention.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.560]   And so the danger and consequence of being distracted,
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.640]   of hurrying, letting our desires consume us,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.800]   is how easily we remove ourselves from God's presence
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.780]   and out of his speaking range.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.440]   Our manic lifestyles, whether you realize it or not,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.960]   disconnects and actually threatens our connection
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.220]   with our living God.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.400]   And of course, God knows we've done,
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.480]   we've tried everything we can to fix this and to help this,
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.720]   but perhaps our solution to these states
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   that we find ourselves in isn't found in reduction
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.560]   or in elimination, but rather in a redirection
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.480]   to what God has for us.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.840]   Church, in this period of Advent,
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.100]   God redirects our attention back to him,
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.680]   back to what he's saying,
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.920]   back to what is most important to him.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.960]   He directs the church, that is us,
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.160]   to reflect on our readiness
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.400]   and to anticipate his son, his second coming,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.240]   but more importantly and just as important,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.480]   God redirects our attention to remind us
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.240]   that Jesus is already with us,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.200]   he's already present in our life right now.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.120]   And God reminds us that he has given us the spirit
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.320]   so that we don't have to walk each day alone
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.580]   or without any help.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.720]   So church, this morning, I just want to let God address you.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.160]   I want him to, I've been praying
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.380]   that he would show you something about himself
[00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.200]   or that he would just remind you of something
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.760]   that he wants you just to remember,
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.020]   just to continue to work in,
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.040]   something he wants to encourage you in,
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.300]   something he wants to comfort you in.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.520]   And as Andrew said, God does not condemn.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.960]   He reminds us because he loves us.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.700]   And so today, as we talk about the baptism,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.400]   we're not gonna go verse by verse as we're used to.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.600]   I would like to share God's desire,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.200]   his heart for the church that is us
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.400]   and what it means to be baptized.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.700]   And so I pray that God would reveal this to you today.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.680]   So church, I'm just gonna pray for us.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.980]   So would you pray with me?
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:57.000]   Lord, I have done my humanly best to prepare for today.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.420]   And only you, Lord, can say what you want to say
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.600]   to each of my family members listening, wherever they are.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.500]   So Lord, I surrender this morning to you
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.280]   and I trust that you will speak
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.640]   because I will say a lot of things this morning,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.320]   but I pray that you would just say that one thing
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.420]   to each person as they need it
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.920]   and that it would change them, it would form them,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.320]   it would transform them.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.680]   And you are with us.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.520]   Lord, thank you, in your name we pray, amen.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.280]   So with that, we are gonna jump into our passage today.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.680]   We're in Mark chapter one, verse one to eight.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.320]   Please read with me.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.880]   The beginning of the good news about Jesus,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.440]   the Messiah, the Son of God,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.840]   as it is written in Isaiah the prophet.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.000]   I will send my messenger ahead of you
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.800]   who will prepare your way,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.140]   a voice of one calling the wilderness.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.040]   Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.240]   And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.980]   preaching a baptism of repentance
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.700]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.360]   The whole Judean countryside
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.500]   confessing their sins.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.240]   They were baptized by him in the river Jordan.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.480]   John wore clothing made of camel's hair
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.220]   with a leather belt around his waist
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.000]   and he ate locusts and wild honey.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.480]   And this was his message.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.600]   After me comes one more powerful than I,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.280]   the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.240]   to stoop down and untie.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.040]   I baptize you with water,
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.580]   but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.480]   This passage marks the beginning
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.800]   of how Jesus became the Messiah
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.160]   and how he was introduced.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.560]   And it starts with the Old Testament prophecy from Isaiah
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.680]   and how John the Baptist was the fulfillment of that.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.700]   And John's ministry really was to preach
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.320]   and to prepare God's people,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.640]   prepare their heart to say that the Messiah will come.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.820]   You just have to wait, you just have to be ready.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.040]   And so in this passage,
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.120]   John's preaching represents God's calling,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.840]   us out of the wilderness, out of our distractions,
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.360]   out of our busyness and hurrying and restlessness
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.040]   to receive the baptism of repentance
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.320]   for the forgiveness of sins
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.960]   and the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.680]   So this morning I want to spend time
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.760]   unpacking the significance of each baptism
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.720]   and why it is important for us as believers
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.240]   to receive or to know about these baptisms.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.640]   In verse four, John the Baptist appears in the wilderness
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.520]   and begins preaching about the baptism of repentance
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.200]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.440]   And so here are a few but brief thoughts
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.960]   on the significance of this water baptism.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.600]   So let's start in the Old Testament.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600]   Wherever there is water imagery,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.400]   it is typically alludes to the presence
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.920]   and the work of God's spirit.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.480]   And of course in the New Testament,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.240]   Jesus too uses water to describe the cleansing
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.840]   and renewing work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.840]   And so to baptize is a verb that means to immerse.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.240]   And so baptism as we understand it
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.680]   as from a church perspective
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   and what we've been practicing
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.320]   all of these years and generations
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.160]   is baptism is the practice of immersing someone
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.600]   into the water.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.440]   And by doing this, it represents a symbolic
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.760]   and a spiritual act of being born again,
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.800]   of being cleansed, being renewed,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.480]   being resurrected with Christ in a new identity with him
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.360]   to have a new beginning in this life with God.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.600]   And that's what we witness all the time.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.720]   And so church, each of us will most likely
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.000]   just get baptized once in our lifetime
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   as the physical, symbolic and spiritual declaration
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.240]   of our faith just as I've mentioned.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.240]   And for majority of us, once is really enough.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.560]   But within the heart and the idea behind baptism
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.480]   is the spiritual posturing of our own heart
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.160]   that has invaluable benefits in this life with Christ
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.240]   and the life to come.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   And so church, today I want us to ask God this,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.720]   Lord, what does it mean to be baptized by you?
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.960]   What does it mean to be immersed by you
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.640]   and with you each day of our lives as your children?
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.560]   How does this look like?
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.240]   What must change in my heart for me to receive
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.440]   both these baptisms as a posturing of my heart,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.880]   as my act of worship?
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.240]   Lord, I'm tired.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.240]   This is for some of us.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.960]   If we're tired, we're a bit cynical,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.760]   we're a bit apathetic to this faith.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.320]   We've been around for so long.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.280]   How can I still receive the baptism
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.760]   that you have for me today?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.000]   And so within the call to be baptized
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.040]   is a personal invitation to you to be transformed,
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.880]   to be renewed, to be immersed by God himself
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.980]   in his love as our way of life every single day.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.080]   This is our spiritual journey.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.560]   This is something we go on for the rest of our life.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.080]   And that's our heart's cry when we want to be baptized.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.340]   We're saying, Lord, I wanna be baptized by you.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.240]   I want you to lead me out of my wilderness.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.000]   I wanna follow you wherever you are.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.880]   I want you to bring me into the second birth.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.680]   I want you to show me how your kingdom works,
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.960]   what the culture is like, what you value,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.560]   what you say, because all those things I want
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.080]   and I want to learn to follow you.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.820]   In verses four to five, as John the Baptist
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.220]   preaches about the baptism of repentance,
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.500]   a lot of people listen, right?
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.660]   They went to him, they responded to his message,
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.300]   they confessed their sins and were baptized
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.140]   by him in the River Jordan.
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.200]   I want to take a more detailed look now
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.060]   at what it means to respond in forgiveness,
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.140]   repentance, and confession.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.980]   I believe all these men and women
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.860]   that came from everywhere heard John the Baptist
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.100]   preach the good news to them.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.920]   John gave them an opportunity,
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.260]   perhaps, to acknowledge that, you know what?
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.880]   Yeah, life is difficult, life is tragic,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.020]   but you know what?
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.380]   Out of the wilderness, graciously, divine,
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.140]   God divinely calls us out of our wilderness.
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.940]   God shows us another way.
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.460]   God shows us that the Messiah will come
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.120]   and he's not just gonna change our lives,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.220]   but he's gonna change the reality,
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.340]   our very understanding of reality
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.920]   and everything that's attached to it
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.820]   through his son and what's gonna happen on the cross
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.540]   and the days after the cross.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.780]   I think John there would have alluded
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.060]   to God forgiving us as well as the gospel.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.920]   When we're baptized, we can start again
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.260]   because we're forgiven, we know that we're forgiven.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.060]   We are released from all the cages that hinders us,
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.260]   our hate, our self-hate, our anger,
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.700]   our sin, our guilt, our shame, whatever it is.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.260]   We find out that forgiveness is not just a feeling,
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.960]   but it's a decision.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.120]   The good news is that God made a decision to forgive us.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.380]   He continues to extend his forgiveness
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.700]   and his grace to us each day
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.500]   and as we receive it, we are healed, we are liberated,
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.940]   we are reconciled with God as well as each other.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.540]   And church, I wanna share the greatest news
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.700]   about forgiveness.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.540]   Forgiveness removes any barriers between God and us,
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.700]   whether they're emotional, physical, mental, spiritual,
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.020]   and forgiveness also just opens up the possibility
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.600]   for a relationship to flourish.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.000]   As Christians, then, we are commanded,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.840]   not commanded, I wanna stress that word.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.280]   We're commanded also to forgive one another
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.660]   because we are gonna hurt each other,
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.400]   we're gonna offend each other,
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.480]   in the same way God forgives us
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.760]   so that others may too release and experience
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.040]   God's love and God's grace and his forgiveness through us.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.640]   Now, when we hear God calling us,
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.620]   we can really only respond by repentance.
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.980]   According to scripture, it is only through repentance
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.500]   that we can come into God's kingdom.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.200]   Repentance is an action where we make a decision
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.500]   to change maybe our way of thinking
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.540]   and our current trajectory of where we are going
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.780]   and want to go.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.240]   But to change requires humbleness,
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:17.400]   it requires a humility, it requires a willingness to listen.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.500]   And these men and women listened and they heard,
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.460]   and what they heard, they yearned,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.960]   they knew that they wanted it,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.900]   so they gave up everything and they said,
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.860]   "Yes, we want this."
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.800]   I think repentance also means that
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.400]   there's nothing you can do for yourself
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.920]   and that you recognize that
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.640]   and you wanna change your thinking.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.520]   One of my favorite spiritual teachers, Bruce Demiris,
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.100]   and I've been really thinking about his words
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.800]   in the last few months, and I wanna read you this quote.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.460]   He says, "The truth is, we will never change
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.460]   "unless we're sufficiently challenged with new ideas."
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.800]   I think this baptism John the Baptist was preaching
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.940]   was this new radical idea.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.160]   God calls us what to himself?
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.900]   They've never heard of something like this.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.320]   As growing Christians, we must learn, too,
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.200]   to be receptive to change, to fresh insight,
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.000]   to new leadings into unexplored spiritual territory,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.440]   or else we do miss out on finding true life
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.200]   and our true selves with Christ.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.160]   And so our spiritual journey,
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.600]   wherever we are in this journey,
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.120]   requires always an openness to change,
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.800]   and that's called repentance.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.140]   And so if we're willing to receive the forgiveness,
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.380]   we're willing to repent and be open-minded,
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.520]   we also respond by confession.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.700]   Our confession is a way of declaring with our words,
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:46.540]   but also with action, and we're committing ourselves
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.660]   to live another way, and that is his way.
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.500]   And so when we confess, we say something like this.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.100]   I confess and choose to turn away from the sin,
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.980]   the idolatry, the anxieties, the fears,
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.260]   all the things that cause us to be unfaithful
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.300]   to you and to each other.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.940]   I no longer want to be a slave to these things.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.860]   I want to be free, as you say that I can be free.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.420]   Lord, in all of these areas that I've offended you,
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.140]   I've offended my brother and sister,
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:19.280]   would you forgive me and allow me to start again
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.200]   by removing this barrier between us and between us?
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.260]   And wherever you are, I confess that's where I want to be.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.580]   Whatever you say, I want to learn to do,
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.540]   so bring me into your green pastures,
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.380]   into your still waters.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.380]   And so by our confession, God redirects every aspect of us
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.420]   into a better way of thinking,
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.660]   in a better way of living with him.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.500]   And so, so far, I want to summarize
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.980]   what I've been talking about in the last 15 minutes.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.740]   The heart and intention behind baptism
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.600]   is a daily invitation into a lifelong journey
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.680]   out of the wilderness with our God.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.180]   As we respond to our living God that calls us,
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.060]   we reestablish, we rebuild, we reconnect
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.420]   these connections, these relationships.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.340]   And as we journey with God, he teaches us what to focus on,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.660]   what to grow in, how to love, how to forgive,
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.700]   all of these things we might have missed in our first life.
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.300]   And in living, in following Christ,
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.060]   we find our meaning, our purpose, our satisfaction,
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.580]   and our way of life as Christians.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.220]   So from here on, I want to now think about,
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.560]   for us to think about the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.620]   and how this comes into the grand picture
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.900]   in the narrative of us journeying with God
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.580]   out of the wilderness.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.620]   And I just want to make one more disclaimer, okay,
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.600]   last one for today, about the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.340]   For many of us, I think, if we grew up
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.380]   in the charismatic denomination or tradition,
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.340]   the word baptism of the Holy Spirit
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.860]   actually comes with a lot of baggage.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.640]   At least for me, it does.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.660]   Many immediately, you know, I think of receiving tongues,
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.860]   receiving all the spiritual gifts all at once,
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.780]   or experiencing some kind of really dramatic thing
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.540]   that we read about in Acts.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.580]   I want to reassure you that my heart today for us
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.420]   is not to do that, although we can do that some other time,
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.140]   but maybe not this morning.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.820]   But I want to clarify this for you.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.180]   I want to clarify that the Spirit of God comes to us
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.420]   as believers when we first believe and confess Christ
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.660]   at the first point of salvation.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.500]   So what I have to say now about the baptism of the Spirit
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.180]   is an additional aspect, an additional dimension
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.680]   to our salvation, to our baptism, and our faith.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.620]   So in verse seven, John the Baptist says
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.340]   that there is someone coming who is more superior,
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.700]   who's more powerful than himself.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.260]   And in verse eight, John says the one who is to come
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:56.420]   will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.860]   So what does this baptism look like and mean?
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.620]   Mark makes a very important contrast
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.820]   between the water baptism here
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.980]   and the baptism of God's Spirit,
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.380]   in that water baptism in of itself is inadequate.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.660]   That means it is not enough, church,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.000]   to be baptized in water alone,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.720]   because in our hearts, in our spirits,
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.340]   what we truly need and yearn for
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.660]   is to receive the very presence of God himself.
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.100]   And as Christians, the good news is that we are promised
[00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.500]   and given the indwelling presence of God.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.560]   By his Spirit, we become more connected to him,
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.780]   we're able to hear him,
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.840]   and we allow ourselves to be satisfied by him.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.580]   We are created, God intended us to be created
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.020]   to be in a strong and genuine encounter and dialogue
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.260]   and a conversation with him every single day,
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.140]   and this is only possible because of the Spirit.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.300]   And so the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.780]   reminds us fundamentally every single day
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.060]   that apart from him, without him, we can do no good thing.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.920]   We can do nothing.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.600]   It is not us, ultimately, who moves us in this journey.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.760]   It is not us that brings about the change
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.300]   that we pray and yearn for.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.740]   It is God's Spirit and what he's doing alone.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.820]   It's his presence in our life that allows us to do that.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.020]   And so, church, we are also incomplete
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.140]   until we welcome the Spirit
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.660]   and allow him to initiate our growth,
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.980]   to allow him to liberate us from bondage,
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.460]   to allow him to heal us of our woundedness
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.140]   and our brokenness,
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.180]   allow him to cleanse us of the uncleanliness,
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.440]   and to really allow him to make us whole
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.140]   in the personhood of Christ.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.300]   And this is only possible when we say,
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   yes, Lord, immerse me in not just forgiveness,
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.060]   but in your Spirit every single day,
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.140]   or else, otherwise, I can do nothing and I am incomplete.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.900]   And church, one more thing that I want to say
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.700]   about the Spirit is that Jesus says
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.980]   that there will be a time where many will claim
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.260]   to be like Christ.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.780]   They will be claimed, meaning that they are Jesus,
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.820]   and they will do Christ-like things,
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.580]   and they will deceive many people.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.940]   And Jesus says there will be a day
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.180]   when there will be sheep dressed up as sheep's clothing,
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:26.580]   and they will deceive and lead the children of God astray.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.100]   And Jesus points to a day
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.980]   where the truth is gonna be undermined,
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.760]   and that the truth will be severely twisted
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.500]   to serve other selfish gains.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.020]   And church, we already live in this day.
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.500]   As Jesus says in John 16, verse 13,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.020]   he says, "The Spirit of truth has come,
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.060]   "and he will guide us into all truth."
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.260]   This, I share this because this is good news.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.940]   God gives us the Spirit, and he immerses us in the Spirit
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.660]   so that we will not be easily deceived.
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.860]   He will give us the Spirit, which is a compass
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.600]   that will continually speak and remind us
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.460]   and to encourage us and to comfort us,
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.700]   and ultimately, to point us to the truth,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.320]   point us to what is still good and true in this world.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.480]   And no matter how dark it gets,
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.880]   we will still have a compass
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.380]   that leads us back into his presence,
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.220]   where we can continue to live in the fullness
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.380]   of what he intended.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.700]   So church, the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.800]   is the most glorious treasure
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.640]   we will ever possess in this life,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.340]   and because that is the very presence of yourself.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.340]   And so our response to the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.780]   is to know that our daily worship,
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.680]   our daily response is to host the presence of God,
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.420]   is to make room in our hearts,
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.300]   is to welcome him every single day and say,
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.880]   "Lord, if you do not come, I am incomplete.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.900]   "If you do not come, I will continue to ask you
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.720]   "and invite you to come.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.160]   "Whatever I do, wherever I am, whatever season,
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:03.500]   "whatever wilderness, desert, just be with me, Lord.
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.720]   "I, I, sit with me.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.080]   "I wanna sit with you."
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:12.060]   You know, recently, church, we've experienced history,
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.540]   not just this year, but recently,
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.140]   we were able to baptize our brothers and sisters
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.780]   in the Vine Church, first ever historic in-house baptism
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.220]   that took place on November 8th for the entire Sunday,
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.620]   and I know a lot of you were there.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.020]   And I'm just grateful that the Spirit of God
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.900]   inspires us to do such things,
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.660]   and I do wanna just thank you for everyone
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.780]   that spearheaded that, you know who you are.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:43.740]   And, and just to be able to do what we as a church
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.220]   are called to do, which is to see others baptized,
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.740]   to see people immersed in God's presence.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.620]   And I had time to actually read over a lot
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.060]   of the testimonies that were written
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.700]   by our brothers and sisters that day,
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.120]   and I want to just sum up.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.100]   I don't have enough time to go through every one,
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.900]   but I wanna sum up the general, unique journey
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.460]   that each brother and sister took,
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.260]   and that they moved from a place of desolation,
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.740]   a place of isolation, the wilderness, the desert,
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.900]   to a place where, you know what, things are not perfect,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.380]   they're not completely healed,
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.700]   but they got to a place where they could breathe again,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.180]   where they could actually hear their thoughts again,
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.060]   where they could be liberated,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.220]   where they had a new perspective,
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.500]   that they felt free to love and to speak
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.420]   and to know and that they're not alone.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.340]   And so this is the journey of baptism,
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.180]   this is the posturing of our heart,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.180]   and all these men and women before us,
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.980]   on Sunday, November 8th, they said,
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.420]   we found the way, and I declare and I confess,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.340]   this is the way I wanna continue to live from now on,
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.140]   with our God leading us.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.540]   And so I wanna share this quote
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.180]   from a philosopher, theologian, Martin Buber,
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.620]   and I feel like he sums up this baptism,
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.460]   our baptism journey, and also our reality,
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.860]   our shared reality as Christians.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.140]   He says, "God is no object of discourse,
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.180]   "knowledge, or even experience.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.420]   "He cannot be spoken of, but He can be spoken to.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.100]   "He cannot be seen, but He can be listened to.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.580]   "The only possible relationship with God
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.740]   "is to address Him and to be addressed by Him,
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.220]   "here and now."
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.900]   Church, this describes the Christian life
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.980]   that all of us are on,
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.740]   and the beauty of being addressed by God,
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:35.380]   and for us to address God and to listen to God,
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.820]   you know, it's not without struggles,
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.220]   but it is what it is, and this is the beautiful gospel,
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.540]   this is the life that all of us are called to.
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.500]   And for me, each day, when I live out this baptism,
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.900]   each day is a new opportunity for me
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.380]   to call out to God in my wilderness
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.500]   of being distracted, of hurrying, of busyness,
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.500]   of misplaced desires, of idolatry, of sin, and anger.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.220]   You know, each day I cry out to God,
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.540]   and I say, "Lord, I don't wanna live like this anymore.
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.660]   "I can't live like this.
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.660]   "I can't bear to live like this,
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.180]   "so would you show me another way?
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.300]   "I don't mind pain, I don't mind the suffer,
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.940]   "but just show me another way.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.100]   "Walk with me just through today.
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.580]   "That's what I'm asking for, Lord."
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.780]   And each day, I'm so forgetful, I just pray one thing.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.140]   I say, "Lord, may I go through this day not to forget you,
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.820]   "not to know that you sit with me."
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.500]   And I spend most of my energies just to remind myself
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   that He indeed is present with me.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.780]   And in the last four to five months,
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.740]   I've actually been in the same spot with God.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.340]   I've been surrendering more or less the same one thing.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.180]   I've been praying the same prayers every single day.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.260]   My prayer is this, "Lord, baptize me,
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.520]   "immerse me in your presence, in your word,
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.760]   "and teach me not to be upset and angry
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.700]   "and lash out at my children."
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.620]   You know, and it's painful.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.940]   It's humbling when your own children
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.660]   teach you how to parent.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.660]   But I think that's God speaking out of the wilderness to me.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.040]   And I think the important thing is to remain repentant,
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.100]   to be open, because God is God, right?
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.700]   He is the Lord of all creation, all over everything.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.420]   And so I don't mind spending the rest of my life
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.960]   just praying the same thing, learning what God has for me,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.820]   if I am to grow to be more like Him.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.860]   And so, church, I just wanna say,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.740]   don't be discouraged in where you are,
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.380]   because He is with you.
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.940]   And we're supposed to struggle,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.940]   so don't be so hard on yourself.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.460]   If God can speak to me as I practice preaching,
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.780]   as I prepared for today,
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.540]   He really just spoke to me at 11.20 last night,
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.420]   then I'm sure He can speak to you in any situation, church.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.160]   So practically, how does this look like
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.260]   for you and I to live out?
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.900]   I want to suggest three things
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.480]   that I've been personally adopting in my own life
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.080]   as a way to live out this idea and heart of baptism.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:11.020]   And I just ask again, how do you and I posture ourselves
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.840]   to be immersed in this way of life?
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.500]   First, I would say the key is to be always ready
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.380]   to be repentant at any time.
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.680]   Guard your heart so that you're always ready
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.520]   and able to respond to God,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.200]   even if it's just a very little thing
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.840]   that you can say or do.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.760]   You know, God shows up in the most inconvenient times.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.800]   He shows up in the most awkward times.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.440]   He shows up in our conversations.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.880]   He shows up with people we don't like,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.480]   people who we don't even want to see,
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.160]   but yet God is there showing us in our disappointments,
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.920]   in our interruptions, in our pain and grief.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   He is there to show us Himself and to show us another way.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.460]   And so that you will see, you'll be able to see
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.460]   if you are willing to follow Him, new perspective.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.580]   And I think in this life, we will be distracted.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.700]   We will be busy.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.700]   We will be tempted, but no matter what,
[00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.860]   always try to get back to this place
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.500]   where your heart can say, "Lord, immerse me.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.900]   "Lord, I know today's been really messed up,
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.400]   "but immerse me, that's all I need."
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.040]   Second suggestion is to immerse yourself in Scripture
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.300]   so that you can make room for the Holy Spirit in your life.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.220]   Why do I say this?
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.700]   Because this is what Christians do.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.700]   This is what, this is the only way we know.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.940]   This is our way of life.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.500]   Without letting Him address us with His words,
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.460]   we will not be able to live.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.660]   You cannot discern God's voice
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.540]   from the deception of the enemy,
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.900]   from the good and well-intentioned things of this world,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.740]   from God's intention.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.380]   You know, and my prayer is really simple.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.140]   My prayer is, "Lord, when I wake up,
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.820]   "I want you to be the first person that addresses me.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.900]   "I want you to be the first person I talk to."
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.020]   And at night, I also just say,
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:06.340]   "Lord, I pray that the person going to sleep right now
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.660]   "is different than the person who woke up
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.480]   "because you encountered me, you spoke to me,
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:16.080]   "you changed my perspective, and I'm so thankful for that."
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.960]   Thirdly, lastly, I want to suggest
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.660]   to keep very short accounts in all our relationships.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.500]   You know, our ultimate test, I think, of our Christianity,
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.740]   whether it's genuine, whether it's sincere,
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.220]   is simply in how we treat each other,
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.340]   how we treat our parents, how we treat our children,
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.740]   how we treat our enemies, how we treat the stranger
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.860]   that we bump into the street
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.140]   when we're in a really bad mood.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:39.060]   What do we say to them?
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.840]   How do we treat them?
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.180]   But the good news is God is in our relationship,
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.880]   so whenever, in any relationship, God is there with us.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.920]   And therefore, I think it's that important
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.720]   to prioritize managing our relationship
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.800]   and keeping short accounts,
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.840]   and that means to practice forgiveness.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.360]   Because once again, I want to remind you,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.380]   forgiveness removes all the barriers between us,
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.680]   between God and us and between you and I.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.480]   And, you know, my prayer has always been that
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.820]   if Christians can be known for anything,
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.640]   it's not for mistakes, it's not for hypocrisy,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.120]   or, you know, what we didn't do, didn't say,
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.020]   but I pray that Christians would be known
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.900]   for our forgiveness, that they would see Christ
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.840]   because in how we choose to forgive,
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.620]   because God has forgiven us.
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:35.300]   So, church, if I can sum up the last 25 minutes,
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.160]   I would say today is really about the work of God
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.120]   and the Holy Spirit and what he desires to do in our life.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:46.720]   In this Advent season, and in every season of our life,
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.680]   this baptism of water and the Holy Spirit
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.220]   represents his invitation to come on a lifelong journey,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.060]   a pilgrimage, a spiritual journey with the triune God
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.480]   who leads us to be truly free,
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.840]   to be truly ourselves in his presence every single day.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.600]   So the simple question I ask you is, will you join him?
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.480]   Will you let him satisfy you?
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.360]   Will you let him address you and transform you?
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   Will you allow him to immerse himself and his love upon you?
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:24.080]   Closing, in closing, church, I wanna say this.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.860]   Do you remember the Great Commission?
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.260]   What does Jesus say there?
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.520]   And I wanna remind you what the Great Commission says.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.380]   He says, "So you must go and make all the nations
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.960]   "into disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.860]   "and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.400]   "Teach them to observe everything I've commanded you,
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.180]   "and look, I am with you every single day
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.300]   "to the very end of age."
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.640]   Note that Jesus calls us to baptize the nations,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.040]   baptize whoever we seize in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.880]   as in we are called as Christians to immerse others
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.840]   in everything we know about God,
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.480]   everything Jesus has given us,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.880]   everything that the Holy Spirit is showing us,
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.960]   we are called to immerse others with this,
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.280]   and this is a command.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:12.580]   And so what I really wanna remind us before we go
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:15.880]   is that our faith must go beyond ourselves.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.800]   We immerse ourselves, we transform, we are changed,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.360]   not for our own sake, but the sake of our neighbor,
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.840]   for the sake of our enemy.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.920]   And so having after received God's presence,
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.240]   we too then must go out and share the presence of God,
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.280]   the love of God, whatever God has given us with others,
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.200]   and so that others may know that there is a journey
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.120]   that God yearns to bring each of us on.
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.500]   And so this is what the Christian life is all about,
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.160]   and I pray that the Spirit will lead you
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.320]   from wherever you are today to walk with Him.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.420]   Church, can we pray?
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:03.740]   Father, you say if we confess our sins, you are faithful,
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:07.140]   you are just, and you will forgive us and will cleanse us.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.140]   You will wash us thoroughly from all that cages us
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.860]   and causes us to be stuck.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.740]   You will free us, you will be able to make us whole again.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:22.740]   So God, today, right now, we ask that you create in us
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.000]   a renewed spirit.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.580]   Father, would your Spirit come and dwell in us.
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.980]   Immerse us, Lord God.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.760]   Father, let us be with you.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.980]   Wherever you are, we confess we want to follow
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.240]   and be with you.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   And Lord, as children, we ask, Lord God,
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.340]   that the one thing is that you would make yourself real
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.260]   to us today, right now.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.400]   Whatever it takes, Lord God, to get our attention,
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.960]   Father, I pray that at the end of today, before we sleep,
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.600]   our hearts would say, Lord, you are the living God.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.080]   You, I will follow.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.320]   You, I will learn more about.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.800]   And one day, I might follow you,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.920]   or maybe we'll say, Lord, thank you for being with me.
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.260]   Thank you for immersing me.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.360]   Thank you for reminding me that I'm not alone,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.920]   that I don't struggle alone.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.820]   I don't go through anything alone because you are with me.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.260]   And so Jesus, this is our prayer.
[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:33.260]   In your beautiful name, would you continue to speak to us
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.500]   every single moment you give to us in this precious life.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.160]   And Lord, teach us to steward and treasure
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.680]   the greatest treasure we will ever, ever receive,
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.620]   and that is you.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.580]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.160]   (gentle music)
