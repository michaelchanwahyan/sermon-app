[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.400]   We're really full today,
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.360]   so I know there's a bunch of people looking for seats.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.420]   So if you've got a seat next to you,
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.760]   maybe you can just put your hand up in the air
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.080]   and we'll be able to get our host to,
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.320]   there's a seat right here at the front
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.440]   if someone wants to take that.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.520]   Yes, you.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.480]   I can see it on your face.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.000]   You're like, "Yes, I want to sit in the front.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.540]   "I'm so excited for Pastor Andrew to spit on me
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.340]   "whilst he's speaking.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.580]   "That's so great."
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.880]   Just got my splash warning in the front here.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.760]   Hey, we're so glad.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.200]   If you're joining the Vine for the first time,
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.760]   we're so glad that you're here with us.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.440]   My name is Andrew, one of the pastors here,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.820]   and it's such a joy.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.760]   I had the privilege of becoming senior pastor here
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.440]   on the 1st of November, 2013.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.160]   And as you can imagine,
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.360]   it was the day of great excitement for me and my family.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.040]   I'm not sure if it was the day of great excitement
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.800]   for anyone else, but it was for me and my family.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.360]   And I was 38 years old at the time,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.480]   and you can now find out how old I am,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.580]   but don't do the math.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.280]   But I was 38 years old at the time,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.200]   and it was a day of joy,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.520]   but it was a day where I was really unaware,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.000]   and in many ways, maybe not ready within myself
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.560]   for what I was stepping into.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.520]   I wonder if you've ever had an experience in your life
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520]   where something's opened up for you,
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.500]   you've got an opportunity,
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.360]   and you work really hard for that opportunity,
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.320]   and you kind of get into that opportunity,
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.960]   and suddenly things maybe don't turn out quite
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.280]   the way you thought it was gonna turn out.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.680]   And I remember that I had been so beautifully prepared
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.140]   for this leadership role here at the Vine
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.140]   by our two founding senior pastors, Tony and John.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.200]   Tony's in this room right now.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.640]   He's gonna hate this, but I'm gonna point him out.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.480]   This is Tony Reed.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.840]   Tony, could you put your hand up in the air
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.880]   so that everybody could honor Tony?
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.480]   (congregation applauding)
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.840]   And John will be watching online
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.400]   as he does so faithfully every week,
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.760]   so John, we honor you too.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.140]   But Tony and John, founding pastors here at the Vine,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.360]   they had prepared me over about a four
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.640]   to five-year process privately,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.480]   just in terms of us as our leadership,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.600]   but then in terms of publicly,
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.120]   about two years before the church.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.460]   So there was a real clear process of transition
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.640]   from John and Tony to myself as the senior leader here.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.560]   And so I just honor the fact
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.720]   that they did such a great process.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.400]   But the reality was, I don't know if you've been married here
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.920]   like you might prepare yourself for marriage
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.200]   and then you get married and you realize
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.960]   that you have no idea what it is to be a husband or a wife.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.800]   I was well-prepared to be senior pastor,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.820]   but then as soon as I became one,
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.280]   I had no idea how to actually do it.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.240]   And in the first couple of months,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.040]   I was overwhelmed by insecurity, by self-doubt,
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.320]   by imposter syndrome.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.000]   Anyone ever had imposter syndrome ever before?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.120]   Feeling like I was unqualified
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120]   and in many ways not worthy
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.440]   of being in the role that I was in.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.760]   And what was interesting for me is that this was
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.800]   kind of sort of catalyzed by a couple
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.760]   of actual physical things that were happening in our church
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.260]   in those first couple of months.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.040]   The first was that as I came in to be a senior pastor here,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.760]   the church had gone through a renovation project
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.520]   of this building a couple of years before then.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.360]   And we had obviously raised a lot of money
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.200]   to be able to do that.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.400]   But the reality was, as I stepped in to be the lead pastor,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.040]   we were $25 million Hong Kong in debt.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.160]   And I knew on a kind of general level
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.680]   that that wasn't my personal debt.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.240]   I knew that that was just the reality of it.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.360]   And it was something that I had been a part of
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.420]   in terms of creating that debt over the years
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.720]   of doing the transformation of this building.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   But again, as a 38 year old taking on that,
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.300]   that was a big responsibility I placed on my shoulders.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.720]   No one placed it on me other than myself.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.520]   I placed that pressure of, man,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.920]   I'm gonna have to perform really well
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.580]   in order for us to get rid of that debt.
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.160]   So that was a weight on me in those first couple of months.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.560]   The other thing that happens,
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.320]   and it's kind of rough when these things happen,
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.520]   but oftentimes when there's a leadership transition,
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.000]   there's a shift, not just in the transition of leadership,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.240]   but also in the people themselves.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.160]   And so in the first two months of me leading here,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.860]   20% of the church left.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.980]   20% of the church left.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.160]   Now, I can look back on that today
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.000]   and with a bit more wisdom and maturity,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.460]   realize that that wasn't probably a personal thing
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.460]   directed at me, but in the moment,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.920]   that felt very personal and very directed at me.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.640]   And I took that reality on my shoulders
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.960]   and the pressure began to build inside of me.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.800]   And the pressure was that John and Tony
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.000]   had done such a great job and had hand over to me.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.160]   And the worry and the concern I had was that
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.800]   in six months, in one year, in a year and a half,
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.560]   the vine will go from this great church
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.080]   that had been built by these two incredible legends
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.840]   to a church that was gonna crumble and disappear
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   under my leadership.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.080]   And again, I placed that stress and that burden on me.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.040]   Now, here's what I did over the first six or so months
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.900]   feeling that pressure.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.560]   I, of course, didn't tell anyone about it.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.480]   I just sat in the privacy of my anxiety.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.580]   I wonder if anyone's ever done that before.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.800]   Just sat in the reality of the brokenness,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.400]   the privacy of my anguish, my anxiety,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.600]   the imposter syndrome.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.640]   And here was the thing,
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.920]   I didn't wanna tell anyone about it
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.480]   because I wanted everybody to think
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.340]   that everything was fine.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.000]   So I go online and watch sermons
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.720]   from back in that first year.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.840]   And here's Andrew up front preaching his heart out,
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.360]   but I know that the Andrew inside was in great turmoil.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.420]   And by God's amazing grace,
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.440]   the church managed to still grow and thrive
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.840]   even though the pastor was dealing
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.680]   with some pretty dark thoughts inside of himself.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.040]   And this duality, the privacy of my anxiety
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.580]   and the public woo-hoo that I was on a Sunday
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.520]   was eating away at my soul.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.080]   And I remember about a year into leading here,
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.000]   I remember just this feeling,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.520]   it was like an air bubble was inside of me
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.720]   of stress and anxiety.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.760]   And I felt like it was just building and building,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.040]   the pressure was building and building
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.920]   and that I had to let it out.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.800]   I had to finally do something about it.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.040]   And I remember I got the courage to WhatsApp my wife,
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.200]   Christine, I didn't have the courage
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.160]   to talk to her about it,
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.880]   but I had the courage to WhatsApp her.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.360]   And I WhatsAppped her and I said,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.680]   we need to go out for dinner tonight.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.120]   And she's like, "Why, what's up?"
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.960]   And I'm like, "I need to talk to you
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.320]   "about something really serious."
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.680]   Now my wife thinks that I'm, I don't know,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.240]   like gonna talk about I'm not happy in our marriage
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   or something like,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.280]   so Chris is like freaking out the whole day.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.080]   We get together for dinner,
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.440]   we're living in Discovery Bay at the time,
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.840]   we're in this very public restaurant,
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.840]   this big restaurant,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.880]   and we sit down and immediately I just start weeping.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.200]   In this big public restaurant.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   And not just like a little tear rolling down my cheek,
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.520]   but I'm like snot bubbles,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.360]   kind of weeping,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.960]   like just weeping and weeping.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.520]   And Chris is just sitting there going like,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.320]   "Oh my goodness, I don't know what's happened,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.720]   "but this is serious."
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.000]   And I said this to her,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.840]   I said, "Honey,"
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.520]   I said, "If I fail,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.080]   "if the church continues to reduce in numbers,
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.840]   "if I'm the worst pastor that there has ever been,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.560]   "and if I don't do a good job,
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.680]   "will you still love me?"
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.000]   And that question betrayed the anxiety
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.520]   and the faulty thinking that was inside of me.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.800]   'Cause it was like in my mind,
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.200]   it was like performance earned love.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.320]   So if I failed,
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.800]   then she has the right to hate me like everybody else
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.080]   and think I'm a failure and leave.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.720]   But if I do well,
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.960]   she should love me.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.400]   But if I fail,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.160]   will you still love me?
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.840]   Now, of course she reached over the table
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.200]   and she grabbed my hands and beautifully,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.400]   "Of course I love you, honey,
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.240]   "I always love you."
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.240]   It was so awesome.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.480]   But she then said two things,
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.120]   two things that became
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.800]   one of those life transforming moments in your life.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.560]   And she said these two things.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.160]   She said, "First of all,
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.240]   "you need to remind yourself
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.640]   "that success in the kingdom of God
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.360]   "is not based on achievement,
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.000]   "but faithfulness."
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.120]   (congregation applauding)
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.960]   And then number two,
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.760]   and this was weird to hear at the start,
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.880]   but I kind of followed with her.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.120]   She said, "There are people better than you."
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.960]   Thanks, hon.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.120]   Feel so much better now.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.520]   She said, "There are people better than you.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.200]   "There's gonna be some pastor out there
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.040]   "who's a better pastor.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.000]   "There's gonna be some preacher out there
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.280]   "who's a better preacher.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.120]   "There are people who are better than you,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.280]   "but no one else has been called
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.320]   "to lead the vine than you."
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.040]   (congregation applauding)
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.880]   Now,
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.640]   those two things I knew
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.680]   because those two things I had held in my spirit
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.040]   when I came into becoming senior pastor a year before.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.760]   But in the privacy of my anxiety,
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.040]   in the isolation that I had created
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.720]   by not sharing with anyone,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.120]   as I had buried the reality of those two truths
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.520]   and allowed other thoughts to dominate in my mind,
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.120]   it was only after I had decided
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.240]   to have the courage to pop the lid,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.440]   to finally be honest about what was going on inside of me,
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.520]   that my wife, the person that I loved the most,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.560]   the person that was my trusted confidant the most,
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.920]   was able to speak truth
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.080]   that was there but deeply buried,
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.560]   truth that I had forgotten
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.800]   and had kind of isolated myself from.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.360]   She was able to bring those two truths out to me,
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.520]   and this was a significant turning point in my life.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.080]   I am not making this up when I say to you
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.000]   that I think the primary reason
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.280]   why I'm still standing here today and leading this church
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.920]   is because of that moment in that restaurant,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.480]   because those words shifted something inside of me.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.160]   And if I had not had the courage
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.720]   to finally be honest about what was going on in here,
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.480]   I don't think I would have lasted.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.080]   And as she said, it's not about achievement but faithfulness.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.040]   You're called and you have to hang on to that calling,
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   even though you might see things going on,
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.840]   you've gotta hang on to that calling.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.240]   Those words brought life.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.680]   My most significant journey of personal transformation
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.200]   started that evening.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.640]   Now, it didn't happen all quick.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.840]   It wasn't suddenly like, "Oh, imposter syndrome, gone.
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   "All that anxiety, gone.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.320]   "$25 million debt, gone," right?
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.720]   There was a journey, of course.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.760]   That journey was a long one.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.120]   I went into counseling,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.600]   and I needed counseling to deal with my anxiety.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.960]   I confessed with some brothers, and I have Hudson's here,
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.120]   some really good brothers of mine
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.600]   who are accountable partners that I pray with regularly
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.760]   and confess with them,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.920]   and they stood and prayed for me as well.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.280]   It was a journey of Chris and I in our marriage
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.080]   reconstituting what was going on there
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.760]   because in that year, I had isolated her
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.200]   from some of the deep things.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   So there was a journey of healing,
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.800]   but it started because there was a significant pivot
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.400]   that took place when I went from a place of private anguish
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.240]   to public confession.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.120]   As we continue our journey in personal transformation
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.080]   in this theme that we're in over these weeks,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.120]   looking at the book of Ezra,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.120]   and particularly Ezra chapter three,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.320]   where Israel has come out of their brokenness in Babylon.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.200]   They've come back into a place of standing in that ruins
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.240]   and the rubble of the old temple that had been destroyed.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.600]   And in chapter three of Ezra,
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.780]   we see this beautiful picture of the builders coming out
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.520]   with the cornerstones and placing the first stones down
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.860]   for the rebuilding of the second temple.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.820]   In that story, we see seven words,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.320]   seven words that I believe for some of you here today
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.880]   are gonna be a pivotable transformation moment in your life.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.640]   Simple seven words that I think if you can understand
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.160]   the truth behind these words,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   could be a little bit like what it was like for me
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.000]   to sit in that dinner and hear my wife speak truth into me.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.360]   Perhaps God's word wants to speak some truth into you today.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.120]   This series so far has been helpful for you.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.720]   If you've been thinking and reflecting
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.040]   over the last couple of weeks about the rubble within you,
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.140]   if you're praying and longing for that rubble to be renewed,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.920]   my prayer is that these seven words
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.320]   would set your heart today alight.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.160]   Let me read this to you.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.840]   I'm gonna jump back a few verses
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.360]   so that we can stay connected to the bigger picture
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.480]   of what we're looking at.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.600]   This is Ezra three, starting in verse 11.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.040]   And all of the people gave a great shout of praise
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.640]   to the Lord because the foundations
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.520]   of the house of the Lord was laid.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.160]   But many of the older priests and Levites
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.840]   and the family heads who had seen the former temple
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.320]   wept aloud when they saw the foundations
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.540]   of this temple being laid.
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.080]   While many others shouted for joy,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.180]   no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.600]   from the sound of weeping
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.380]   because the people made so much noise.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.820]   Here are the seven words.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.540]   And the sound was heard far away.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.380]   Let me say it again.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.340]   And the sound was heard far away.
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.740]   Father, as we open up this just small segment
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.500]   of scripture here this morning,
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.620]   I wanna pray that you would do something significant
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.940]   for each of us and we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.780]   Everyone says.
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.100]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.460]   Ezra describes this crazy moment.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.380]   We saw it last week, the power that there was
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.860]   in a community worshiping and weeping side by side.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.920]   And we taught last week that that is the sound
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.420]   of restoration, this invitation to be able to be honest
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   with what's happening in our lives.
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.460]   And Ezra describes that that sound is so loud,
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.020]   it is so powerful that it mixes together
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.300]   so that no one can distinguish between the either.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.420]   It's like this harmony of sound is created
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.520]   where no one can tell the individual parts,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.220]   but it's just this loud noise.
[00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.620]   And it's such a loud noise that in these final seven words
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.620]   of the verse, Ezra says, and the sound was heard far away.
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.060]   Now that might seem like a simple thing.
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.280]   It might seem like a bit of a throwaway line,
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.700]   perhaps when we study scripture, we read things like this
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.740]   and we just kind of skip over it quite quickly.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.940]   But I think Ezra is wanting to root us
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.340]   into something that is significant in any journey
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.780]   of personal transformation.
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.740]   Here's what he's saying.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.340]   He's saying, well, the transformation process for Israel
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.380]   was a personal concern, it was not a private matter.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:32.300]   I want you to notice this.
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.660]   Ezra's saying the sound of that weeping and worship
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.580]   went out far away.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.300]   There were people far from Jerusalem who could hear it,
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.980]   who could sense it, who were like,
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.340]   what's that noise, intrigue to discover and find out more.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.700]   And while the process of transformation from Israel
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.700]   was personal, deeply personal, it was not private,
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:00.180]   which should challenge all of us because so often
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.500]   one of the reasons that we use to stay private
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.540]   about the stuff in our lives is because it's personal.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.780]   Come on church.
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.420]   It's like, I'm not gonna talk to anybody about this
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.100]   because it's super personal.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.100]   Like it's super personal and what's going on in my life
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.660]   and it's personal to me and so I'm gonna remain private.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.220]   This was one of the most personal moments
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.060]   in Israel's history.
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.660]   We saw last week that the reason why they're weeping
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.020]   is because God has shown them and reminded them
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.740]   about their brokenness, about some of the choices
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.660]   that they had made in the past and the consequences
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.860]   of those choices in their present.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.540]   And when they look at the rubble,
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.500]   they're connecting their personal choices in the past
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.900]   to the personal reality of what's happening there.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.860]   And it tears them up inside and they start weeping
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.500]   because they realize what their choices have created
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.340]   in their lives.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.180]   Nothing more personal than that.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.460]   And then there's this other group who are praising
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.220]   and cheering and are so excited because they see
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.300]   that God's redemptive and restorative work is now at play.
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.020]   And they're beginning to worship and they're beginning
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.060]   to sing praises and these two things are happening there
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.860]   because these two things are the reality
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.420]   of what's happening in that moment.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.620]   And as it goes, even though it's incredibly personal,
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.980]   they are not trying to sweep it under the rug
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.820]   and pretend like it hadn't happened.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.460]   They are exclaiming even the shame of what they have done,
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.540]   but they are not ashamed to proclaim that reality
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:27.860]   in their lives.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.900]   It was personal, but not private.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.100]   It was happening to them,
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.700]   but there were others who could encounter it.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:43.700]   It was their experience, but it was not just their story.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:49.500]   It's fascinating because as I've just shared personally
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.820]   out of my own life, I think that's all of our lives
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.540]   to a certain degree.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.140]   I think when there's stuff going on in us,
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.940]   there's rubble within us that we're aware of.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.540]   When we're going on a journey of healing,
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.300]   when we're still feeling sensitive from that brokenness,
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.060]   when the trauma is real, when the anxiety is being felt,
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.220]   when the fear is upon us, us, all of us,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.380]   our natural temptation, our natural tendency
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.060]   is just to try to keep it from everybody else.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.540]   Just try to be private about it, try to bury it,
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.260]   try to just kind of push it away.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.340]   And at least on the surface, just try to make sure
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.940]   that everybody else thinks that we're perfectly fine.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.500]   We have this danger as humans
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.020]   to almost want to do that naturally.
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.300]   Just take that pain, bury it as much as possible.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.900]   And as long as I come in on a Sunday,
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.180]   raise my hand, sing songs,
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.820]   and if anybody asks me, how are you?
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.860]   I'm great.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.660]   When actually the reality is inside, I'm dying.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.780]   That there's something in here that I can't wrestle with,
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.460]   and I'm just trying to isolate myself from it.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.820]   And it feels like I'm pulling away from everybody around me.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.180]   Now, don't hear me wrong.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.380]   I'm not advocating that you do the exact opposite of that
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.340]   at every moment of your life.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.220]   Trust me, it is not wise to put your whole life on display
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.420]   for absolutely everybody to see.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.700]   Like, oh, Pastor Andrew, he preached about taking things
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.980]   that are private and making them public.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.260]   Okay, well, then I need to tell everybody everything
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.100]   that I ever meet.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.620]   I'm gonna put all my dirty laundry out for everybody to see.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.220]   If you go to work tomorrow, come on, church.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.300]   If you go to work tomorrow and say,
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.900]   oh, I'm gonna put Pastor Andrew's message
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.660]   into application in my life,
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.100]   and I'm finally gonna tell my boss
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.980]   everything I really think about them.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.300]   You will not have a job, okay, on Tuesday.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.180]   Are you with me?
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.980]   So we need to be wise, of course, about how we do this,
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.460]   about who we share with, when we share, and how we share.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.820]   We don't swing the pendulum to the other way and go,
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.660]   everybody needs to know everything about me
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.620]   that has ever happened.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:52.540]   That's not a healthy place to be.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.500]   But here's the thing.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.060]   As human beings, as Christians, we do the opposite thing,
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.660]   the opposite extreme more,
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.100]   which is rather than tell everybody about everything,
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.260]   we don't tell anybody about anything at all.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.980]   And we push it down, we suppress it, we bury it,
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.780]   and we come and we do our thing,
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.380]   but nobody actually knows what's truly going on inside.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.340]   And we kind of operate out of that place.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.060]   And here's why we do it.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.180]   And this is so ironic.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.500]   We do it because we think this,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.660]   if people truly knew what was inside of me,
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.740]   if they truly knew what I thought about things,
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.420]   if they truly knew the things that I've done,
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.180]   if they truly knew the pain that I'm wrestling with,
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.260]   if they truly understood my thought life,
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.460]   well, they wouldn't wanna be my friend anymore.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.860]   They would turn away and they would isolate me.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.180]   They would distance themselves from me.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.420]   I would lose my community.
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.780]   I would lose my spouse.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.420]   I would lose everything in my life.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.700]   And so we're so afraid that if we are honest,
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.380]   people will isolate us.
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.940]   Here's what we do ironically.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.060]   We choose to isolate ourselves.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.300]   Do you follow that?
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.380]   So we think if I share,
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.900]   people are gonna back away and isolate myself.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.540]   So instead we bury within ourselves.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.620]   We choose ourselves to isolate ourselves.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.780]   And on the surface, pretend like everything's fine.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.780]   And we end up living in a duality that is not sustainable.
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:20.380]   A duality of private, brokenness, pain, anxiety, whatever,
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.220]   and public, how are you doing?
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:29.180]   And these two things wear down your soul over time.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.460]   Listen to this.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:37.300]   When your external behavior operates in tension
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.780]   to your internal reality,
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.900]   you will always end up having more rubble
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.460]   and less transformation in your life.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.980]   Come on church.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:51.860]   When your external behavior operates intention
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.060]   to what is actually true inside of you,
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.180]   everything's great.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.500]   No, it's absolutely not.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.300]   And that lasts over an extended period of time.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   Here's what will happen.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.660]   You will basically deteriorate in your mental,
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.900]   in your emotional, and in your spiritual health,
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.820]   which will also have an impact on your physical health
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.740]   'cause we're holistic beings.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:17.380]   Here's Israel,
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.700]   and they're going through some deep personal things.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.420]   Things that are making them weep
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.980]   as well as things that are making them praise.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.700]   And here's what happens.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.060]   Those that needed to weep, wept.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.300]   Those that needed to praise, praised.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.180]   In other words, Israel made a decision
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.500]   that they were gonna ensure that their external behavior
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.420]   actually corresponded to their internal reality.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.420]   So those that were in pain, those that were grieving,
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.700]   those that were feeling bad for the sin that had happened,
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.380]   those that were dealing with the consequences of brokenness,
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.900]   they wept.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.620]   Those who could see the forgiveness of the Lord,
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.940]   who saw the start of a new season,
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.780]   who were excited that God was gonna do something for them,
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.300]   they began to praise.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.500]   And both had space to be who they were.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.820]   Both, could be honest.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.460]   They didn't need to bury.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.780]   They didn't need to be private.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.860]   They didn't need some duality of life.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.220]   The sound of restoration was made loud and clear,
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.060]   and it was beginning to change them.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.860]   And here's what their honesty created.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.620]   It created two things.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.780]   First of all, it created an environment
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.980]   by which they could have a personal community
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.060]   of comfort and healing.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.420]   And secondly, it created an environment
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.300]   in which they could have a public place
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.700]   of hope and restoration.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.780]   And any work of renewal in your life
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.140]   and in a community's life like this,
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.100]   if it's truly gonna have effective impact,
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.140]   these two things have to be operating in that place
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.300]   at the same time.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.260]   A place of comfort and healing,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.700]   a place of hope and restoration.
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.260]   And the thing that makes those two things
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.900]   is that courage to take what is buried within,
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.580]   and with wisdom and being smart about it,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.700]   offer it to those that we trust.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.260]   Let's start with the first one.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.420]   See, Israel understood that as they allowed the space
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.460]   for people to weep and for people to pray,
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.260]   everybody had a place.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.140]   And that because of that,
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.980]   they weren't burying anything inside of them.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.140]   They were opening it up, letting it out,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.180]   getting it up there.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.740]   They were surrounded by this group of people
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.540]   who would be able to come alongside of them and go,
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.020]   "Hey, I see that.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.860]   "I feel that.
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.100]   "I've felt that too.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.460]   "I've dealt with that too.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.980]   "Hey, can I pray with you?
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.100]   "Can I stand with you?
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.820]   "Can I create space with you?"
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.580]   It's really interesting.
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.940]   You gotta understand it this way.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.580]   When you come into relationship with Jesus,
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.580]   you don't just come into relationship with Him,
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.500]   but also relationship with His people.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.940]   This is what church is all about.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.020]   When we are saved,
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.820]   we're not just saved into a new relationship with the Lord,
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.780]   we're saved into a relationship with one another.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.340]   And God has created gatherings like this,
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.900]   church experience in the ways in which we do it,
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.420]   in multifaceted ways.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.740]   He's created it.
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.860]   And He said, "Look, I'm gonna bless it with my spirit.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.820]   "And although, yes, you can open the Bible,
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.100]   "read a word and be encouraged.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.540]   "Yes, you can come in, sing some songs,
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.220]   "and I'll speak to you by my spirit.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.580]   "Some of the most powerful transformative moments
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.740]   "that the Spirit will do in your life,
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.980]   "He will do through somebody else in your life."
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:40.580]   And as we embrace the reality of what God has given us,
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.140]   when we have the courage to not isolate ourselves
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.620]   from the body of Christ,
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.460]   true change and transformation really takes place.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.140]   See, you are not saved
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.420]   into a private redemptive ticket to heaven.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.900]   You're saved into a public here family,
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.860]   redemptive family on earth.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.820]   And God, by His great spirit and His grace
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.020]   and the work of Jesus has adopted us into that family.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.660]   And we now have millions of brothers and sisters
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.780]   all over the world.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.340]   Did you know that God has no grandchildren?
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.660]   Come on, church, work it out.
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.500]   God has no grandchildren.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.180]   He has sons and daughters, His children in a family.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.020]   We're that family.
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.660]   It's not a redemptive ticket out of here.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.060]   Some private, "Oh my gosh,
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.460]   "now I'm in a good relationship with Jesus, I'm saved."
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.380]   Our salvation drives us towards one another
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.500]   in this beautiful redemptive family,
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.860]   whereas brothers and sisters,
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.580]   we get to stand with each other and walk with each other
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.340]   in some of the hardest moments of life.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.180]   This is why Paul, when he's writing to the church
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.500]   in Romans 12, 15, he says it this way.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.620]   He says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice,
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.380]   "weep with those who weep."
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.500]   A beautiful invitation for the body of Christ
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.260]   to be the body of Christ to one another.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.380]   Later in 1 Corinthians 12, 16, I think it is,
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.020]   he says this, he says, "Look,
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.500]   "if any member of the body is suffering,
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.220]   "we're all suffering with them."
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.380]   In other words, don't you understand
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.140]   how integrated and connected we are,
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.420]   that God has created the church to be a place
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.980]   where we rejoice with those who rejoice,
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.220]   weep with those who weep,
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.820]   where when one suffers, we all suffer,
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.860]   and we come together in healing and restoration
[00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.580]   and comfort and joy and love.
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.060]   And when people can be honest and say,
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.820]   "You know what, this is a safe place
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.860]   "for me to let out some of this stuff
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.620]   "that I've been bearing and bearing,
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.420]   "true transformation takes place."
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.460]   Notice what it says, "Rejoice with those who are rejoicing,
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.660]   "weep with those who are weeping."
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.580]   It does not say when somebody confesses something
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.020]   or opens their lives up,
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.820]   that your job is to try to just cheer them up
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.500]   or that your job is to correct their theology.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:04.100]   It says your job is to meet them in their emotion
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.340]   and sit with them in it.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.100]   Rejoice if they're rejoicing,
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.260]   weep if they're weeping,
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.020]   find a place of connection and sit with them
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.100]   because they need, they've taken all this courage to,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.420]   I mean, imagine if my wife had leant across the table
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.020]   and she said, "Just suck it up."
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.540]   Or if she'd leant across the table and said,
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.420]   "Let me just open up Luke chapter 15."
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.860]   (congregation laughing)
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.700]   Right?
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:32.900]   But we do that to one another.
[00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.100]   That's part of the reason why sometimes
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.900]   we keep things buried and we don't share
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.500]   'cause maybe we have shared in the past
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.100]   and somebody responded in a way
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.460]   that wasn't what we were thinking,
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460]   wasn't what we were expecting,
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.500]   and it's hurt us even more
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:43.860]   and we buried and buried and buried.
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.660]   We've all had those kinds of experiences,
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.500]   but it doesn't stop Paul writing to the church
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.380]   and it doesn't stop me standing here before you today
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.300]   and saying, "We have to push beyond those bad experiences."
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.860]   That just 'cause somebody didn't respond how I thought,
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.020]   doesn't mean the next time I do it, it's gonna be the same.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.580]   No, I still have the pain.
[00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.620]   I need someone to pray for me, stand with me, support me.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.020]   Jesus himself did this.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.020]   The night in the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.340]   his greatest personal trial and challenge,
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.220]   knowing that the cross was just a few days away,
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.540]   he brings, notice this,
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.420]   he brings all the disciples with him
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.820]   to the Mount of Olives to pray.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.980]   But then Matthew tells us,
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:26.980]   he takes his three best friends, James and John and Peter,
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.900]   and he takes them a little bit further
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.060]   and he says these words.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.460]   He says, "Stay with me, pray for me, pray and guard,
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.940]   pray against temptation.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.660]   I need you to stand with me."
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.940]   'Cause he's like, he's about to sweat blood.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:43.540]   He's in a place of deep personal anguish.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.540]   Jesus understood this was a personal journey,
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:47.780]   but not a private matter.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.100]   Come on church.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.180]   And so he demonstrates to us, the son of God,
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.780]   that he needed his best friends praying
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.900]   and standing with him, supporting and speaking life into him
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.780]   to get him through the darkness of that hour.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:02.540]   Now, the reality is they fell asleep.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.940]   That's a whole nother story.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.100]   That's a whole nother sermon.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.660]   We're not gonna go there right now.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.580]   But do you see what he's demonstrating to the church?
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:15.460]   Some of you here are in the body of Christ,
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.180]   but you are remaining distant and private
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.020]   from the very people God has placed around you.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.300]   Jesus didn't do it, neither should you.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:28.580]   Here's the second thing.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.660]   The second thing is, as Israel begins to be honest
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.940]   about the reality in their lives,
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.380]   as they weep and they worship,
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.340]   as they have one another to bring that comfort in life,
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.100]   it's not just that healing and restoration
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.260]   that happens for them.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.660]   Others are able to now hear and see and go,
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.780]   hang on a sec, something significant is happening over there
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.700]   and something's beginning to change.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.780]   What is that?
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.940]   That's interesting.
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940]   And they can be drawn.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   We don't have time to look at it today,
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.260]   but if you follow on with the rest of the story,
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.740]   the other nations begin to hear of the transformative work
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.820]   that's happening in Israel,
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.020]   and some of them get scared and wanna fight back,
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.180]   like we'll see next week.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.460]   Others are drawn near and wanting to understand,
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:15.180]   is there really a God who can change and transform us?
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.340]   The beautiful thing about a redemptive community
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.740]   who are willing to walk in their pain openly
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.740]   before trusted people in their lives
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   is that it creates hope for those who are a long way off.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:32.540]   God changes you, not just because he wants to change you.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.180]   He changes you because he longs to change your family member,
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:40.140]   your colleague, the person that you're dating,
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.020]   the whatever it might be.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:47.020]   Our own transformation is always in God's hands
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.340]   for him to use as a demonstration.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:59.980]   Every work of private renewal has potential public power.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:07.580]   That's again, what God does in a community like this.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.860]   He creates a church and he brings us together
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.740]   so that our sound would be heard far away.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.060]   So that when we testify about the transformation
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.540]   that the Lord has done in our lives,
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.420]   where we stand publicly and say there was anxiety
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.660]   and there was pain and I shared with someone
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.220]   and they prayed with me and I changed my tune
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.180]   and I began to see myself differently,
[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.020]   I began to see the world differently.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.620]   This is the sound that people outside are desperate to hear.
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.780]   The ones who are seeing the world's news
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.620]   and they're saying,
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.820]   "Is anything good ever gonna come in this world?"
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.780]   The one who are seeing their stocks
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.060]   and their investments go down and are thinking,
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.260]   "Is there anything more to life
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.060]   than what I'm experiencing right now?"
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:53.860]   And if the church is making the sound of restoration
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.620]   and the only people that can hear it
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.260]   are the ones in this room right now, we are not church.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.100]   What's the point?
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.380]   Jesus didn't die on the cross
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.660]   for the church to be a holy huddle.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.580]   He didn't die on the cross
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.980]   so the church could be some thing on the hill
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.300]   far away from the world.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.980]   He died on the cross so that the sound of restoration
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.820]   would be heard by those far away.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.420]   That the thing that the Lord has done in your life,
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.300]   no longer suppressed but spoken out of
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.500]   and given hope, brought light into,
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.100]   could be the very thing that might bring them new life.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.780]   There is always transformative power
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.980]   in the public witness of a private renewal.
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.380]   That's a summary of the book of Acts,
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.540]   if there ever has been one.
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.260]   At the book of Acts at the beginning, Jesus says,
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.660]   "You're gonna go from here filled with my spirit
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.820]   so that you would be my what?
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.540]   My witnesses.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.220]   So that what I've done in you would be seen in the world
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.500]   so that others might find hope in that reality.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.180]   There is always transformative power
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.620]   in the public witness of a private renewal.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.620]   But any time we keep it all buried,
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.140]   we're diminishing the sound
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.860]   that was meant to be heard far away.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.420]   I wanna read you just something that Paul says
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.620]   in 2 Corinthians as he's trying to kind of picture this
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.940]   to his church.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.900]   He says these beautiful words in 2 Corinthians 1 verse 3.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.020]   He says, "Praise be to the God and the Father
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.540]   of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.140]   the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.780]   who comforts us in our troubles
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.500]   so that we can comfort only ourselves in private
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.740]   in our services.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:43.060]   Who comforts us in our troubles
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:46.420]   so that we can comfort those in any trouble
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.980]   with the comfort that we ourselves have received from God."
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.340]   When we read a passage like that,
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.540]   we think Paul is actually speaking specifically
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:54.380]   about the church.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:56.420]   Of course, he's speaking into the church,
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.340]   but he's using language here where he's saying,
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.060]   "Don't you understand that in the church,
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.500]   when you experience that comfort and that renewal
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.500]   in your life, you are then able to comfort any trouble,
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.620]   any person who's got trouble."
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.660]   He's not saying just those in church who believe in Jesus
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.860]   and sing Kumbaya with you on a Sunday.
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.900]   He's saying anyone who has trouble,
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.860]   who is struggling when Christ comforts you.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.180]   There is a overflow of that comfort
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.500]   that is not just for those that believe in Jesus,
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.140]   but it's for those that are desperately in need of Jesus.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.420]   And that as we begin to operate in a place
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:38.420]   of public release to the private renewal,
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.380]   the church becomes the church.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.300]   One of my favorite stories in Jesus' ministry
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.660]   is this moment where Jesus is walking through the crowds
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.180]   and the crowds by this point,
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.620]   he's been ministering for some time
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.900]   and the crowds have grown and grown and grown.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.100]   And in fact, he's still in Galilee
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.460]   and he's still surrounded daily by these crowds.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.980]   And everybody's trying to get a piece of Jesus.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.900]   Everybody's trying to clamber onto him,
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.620]   press around him, try to get a hold of him.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:10.100]   And in this story, a woman who had been bleeding
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.460]   for 12 years, the kind of bleeding that meant
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.220]   that she was ceremonial unclean all the time,
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.860]   meant that she was cast as an outcast in her community.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.580]   The sort of bleeding that you would wanna keep
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.380]   very, very private, not let anyone know about it,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.700]   not talk about it with anyone.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.620]   This woman, she hears that Jesus has done miracles
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.180]   around Galilee and she's heard the stories
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.460]   that he might be the Messiah
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.220]   that the Jewish people have been longing for.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.060]   And the Bible tells us that in faith,
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.980]   she decides this one can heal me.
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.020]   I believe that he is the Messiah.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.460]   I believe he can set me free.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.380]   And in that faith and belief,
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.300]   she decides to press through the crowds
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.100]   so that she could just get a hold of Jesus.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.580]   Let me actually read this to you from Luke chapter eight.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.420]   And we're gonna pick up the story.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.260]   Says this, "As Jesus was on his way,
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.740]   "the crowds almost crushed him.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.700]   "And a woman was there who had been subject
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.500]   "to bleeding for 12 years, but no one could heal her.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.180]   "She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.140]   "and immediately her bleeding stopped.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.460]   "Who touched me? Jesus asked.
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.060]   "When they all denied it, Peter said,
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:26.900]   "Master, the people are all crowding
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.660]   "and pressing against you.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.340]   "But Jesus said, no, someone touched me.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.540]   "I know because power has gone out from me.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.060]   "Then the woman saying that she could not go unnoticed
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.980]   "came trembling and fell at his feet.
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.780]   "In the presence of all the people,
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.020]   "she told why she had touched him
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.660]   "and how she had been instantly healed.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.540]   "And then he said to her in the public
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.460]   "in front of everybody,
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:51.380]   "daughter, your faith has healed you.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.100]   "Go in peace."
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:57.020]   There's this moment where she has the audacity of courage
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.060]   to reach out and as he's walking by,
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.780]   just grasp the hem of his cloak.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.420]   And Jesus stops immediately.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.620]   And as she's doing this, as she grasped that cloak,
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.140]   she's immediately healed.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.860]   It's really important that you understand this.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.980]   She's immediately healed.
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.220]   It's not like she's gotta go through
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.220]   some journey of healing.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.380]   In this particular moment,
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.620]   she's instantly, immediately healed.
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.300]   Jesus stops and says, "Who touched me?"
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.140]   To which Peter, in the blunt way that Peter always is,
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.260]   is, "Dude, everybody's touching you."
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.900]   Like, can't you see the whole crowd around you?
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.660]   Like, are you mad, Jesus?
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.140]   Like, everybody's pressing in on you.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.260]   Everybody's, what do you mean?
[00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.100]   Who's touching?
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.300]   "We're all touching you," Peter said.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.620]   And Jesus is like, "No, power has gone out from me.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.460]   "Who's touched me?"
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.540]   Now, notice this.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:45.020]   He's doing this and he's placing this woman
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.060]   in a place of decision.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:52.540]   She does not need to come forward for further healing.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.940]   She's already received our holy.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.180]   She's instantly healed.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.100]   In other words, she's got what she's come for.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.700]   So she could go, "You know what?
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.740]   "I'm just gonna privately go back into my little hovel.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.500]   "I'm gonna retreat from this moment.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.860]   "I don't need any more of Jesus.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.580]   "He's done what he needs to do in me.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.420]   "I could get away.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.980]   "I'm just gonna slip away."
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.180]   Jesus is like, "No, no, no.
[00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.300]   "You've received your healing,
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.140]   "but there's something else now that I want you to do."
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.700]   And she realizes that she can't escape.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.620]   So she comes forward and she begins to testify.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.460]   We don't have the words.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.580]   I wish we did.
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.100]   But she begins to testify about what she believed Jesus was
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.740]   and the faith that she had and the touching of his cloak
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.140]   and how she had been instantly healed.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.460]   And you can imagine the other people standing around
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.980]   and they're going, "But I've been touching him
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.380]   "and I haven't been healed."
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.180]   Now, this is why Jesus does what he does next.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.060]   This is so cool.
[00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.340]   He calls her forward in front of everybody for two reasons.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.780]   One, her bleeding has ceremonially made her unclean
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:50.700]   in her community.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.300]   So by bringing her forward and her testifying to her,
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.220]   her healing, Jesus was restoring her back to her community.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.460]   You can go back to this community.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.820]   You can now grow with this community.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.900]   They can accept you again.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.740]   So this is a public restoration for her
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.660]   back to her community.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.500]   That's great.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.700]   But that's actually not the main thing
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.620]   I think Jesus is doing here.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.780]   There's this other thing.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.540]   He's now getting her to become the main preach point
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.380]   to the crowd.
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.940]   Because the crowd is thinking we're touching Jesus
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.180]   and nothing's happened.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.100]   She's touched Jesus and she got her healing.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.940]   Why?
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.260]   And Jesus says, "Go in peace
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.460]   "because your faith has healed you."
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.020]   Jesus is basically saying there's a difference crowd
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.020]   between touching me without faith and touching me with faith.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.820]   And he uses her testimony to be the thing
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.060]   that he really wanted to say.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.380]   It wasn't actually about her healing,
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.380]   as amazing as that was for her.
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.460]   That's great.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.580]   But it was this teaching point
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.180]   that her testimony was releasing.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.420]   Some of you in this room,
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.580]   your journey of personal transformation
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.460]   is going to be a testimony
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.460]   that the crowds around you need to hear.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.020]   That Jesus wants to say and do and operate
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.820]   in the people around you in ways
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.580]   that are gonna be totally transformative in the future
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.580]   as you take the courage to testify
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.580]   what the Lord has done.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.820]   We have to be wise about it.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.860]   We don't go bashing people over the head with a Bible
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.780]   at every opportunity we have.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.100]   As you trust the Lord,
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.180]   he will open up avenues for you to come forward
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:26.660]   and say, "This is what happened to me."
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.340]   Some of you in this room,
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.460]   your journey of personal transformation will only begin
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.420]   and the pivot will happen for you
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.820]   when you stop living the duality life
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.700]   of private anguish that no one knows about
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.380]   and public everything is fine.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.220]   Some of you this week,
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.700]   you're gonna be taking a major step of courage,
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.460]   but a major step to the renewal
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.980]   that the Lord wants to do in your life
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.740]   by saying, "I am tired of living as two people."
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.700]   You need wisdom as to who to share with.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.220]   You need to work out what the Lord wants you to do
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.860]   and how to do it.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.860]   But there is someone in your life
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.740]   that the Lord will bring to your mind
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:11.060]   if you pray that prayer honestly
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.460]   that you should open up to this week.
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.660]   And in doing that,
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.060]   you are exposing what the enemy has kept in darkness
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.540]   and you're allowing light,
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.660]   the light of Christ to flood into it.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.740]   As we confess our sin,
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.500]   as we confess our brokenness,
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.140]   as we even confess just the hurt and the pain,
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:34.340]   God heals us through one another.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.460]   So some of you this week,
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.500]   that's the pivot point for you
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.300]   to stop saying, "I don't wanna live like this anymore."
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.220]   I'm gonna have the courage to say, "I need help.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.660]   Would you pray for me?
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.420]   Can you understand this?"
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.260]   And I wanna encourage you that if you're the person
[00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:52.460]   that person turns to,
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.300]   rejoice with those rejoice
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.740]   and weep with those who weep.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.740]   Just be with them.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.620]   Be with them, pray for them,
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.500]   stand with them, love them.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.540]   And some of you here,
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.340]   you've got a testimony to say.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.060]   You've got a proclamation of praise.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.060]   You've gone through a private renewal
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.460]   and now is a chance that God might be explaining
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.580]   and putting before you for some public proclamation
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.300]   of what's privately happened within you.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.220]   Look and pray for the opportunities
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.980]   and we will see many people respond
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.980]   to the sound of restoration.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.820]   Amen?
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.260]   Helpful?
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.380]   All right, let's pray.
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.420]   Father, I just thank you so much
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.820]   for each person here this morning
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.580]   in this journey of Ezra and transformation
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.140]   that we're on here at the Vine.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.860]   And as you just quieten your hearts
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.220]   and as you bow your heads,
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:53.140]   perhaps for some of you,
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.660]   you know that there is immediately an area of your life
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.380]   that you've kept very private.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.700]   As I've explained in the message,
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.540]   we do that for many reasons, fear,
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.340]   sensitive somebody would know they would reject us,
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:09.220]   perhaps just the shame of what it is that we're carrying
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.700]   and we've buried it deeply.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.740]   And we thought we could get away with it.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.420]   We thought we could live a double life.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.820]   We thought that that would be fine,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.660]   but we know it's wearing on our soul.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.700]   We know that our mental, emotional,
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.700]   spiritual life is deteriorating.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.180]   And just like me a year into being senior pastor,
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.220]   there's this bubble coming up out of you
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.700]   and you're like, I can't hold this anymore.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.020]   I'm so tired of it.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.940]   I'm so tired of living a double life.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:42.020]   I wanna pray that if that's you here this morning,
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.860]   whether online, in this room, in the overflow,
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.580]   I wanna pray now that the Holy Spirit would show you
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.460]   the person for you to share with.
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.860]   As you're in this moment,
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.500]   the person for you to share with.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.340]   And I pray that He would give you the courage
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.500]   to do it this week.
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:02.340]   And I wanna pray the blood of Jesus
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.540]   over every conversation,
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.020]   over every exposing of the darkness
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.780]   because the enemy will not like it.
[00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.180]   And as you leave here today,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.180]   you might be feeling in this moment,
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.020]   yeah, I wanna do it.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.420]   And then you'll leave here in a moment
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.100]   and you'll suddenly feel like,
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.500]   oh gosh, that was just a thing in the moment.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.740]   Don't allow the enemy to cause you to retreat again.
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.020]   If you're feeling like this is your time to be open
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.780]   in the week or the couple of weeks ahead,
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.660]   don't let the enemy whisper back into you
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.740]   to retreat you again.
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.660]   I pray Lord for the blood of Jesus,
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.660]   a protection over every person here
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.380]   who wants to have one of those kinds of conversations
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.260]   in the week ahead.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.660]   And Lord, we pray for the fruits of the love
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.020]   and the light and the forgiveness
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.820]   and the grace of Jesus over anything
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:49.300]   that has been kept in darkness.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.820]   And we pray this now in Jesus' name.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.380]   Lord, I pray a releasing over your people.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.860]   And Lord, for those people
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.860]   that you're raising a testimony in.
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:02.260]   Lord, I wanna pray that they would see the avenues
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.460]   and the people that they can share with.
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:07.100]   Lord, we pray that those who are currently in our city
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.420]   who are far off,
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.660]   Lord, we pray that they would hear
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.940]   the sound of restoration in your church.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.980]   Lord, we pray that in our spheres of influence,
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.500]   in our families and the people around us, Lord,
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.980]   that as we begin to proclaim the goodness
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.100]   of a God who has set us free,
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.780]   that we would see others say,
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.540]   I wanna learn more about that.
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.260]   Why do you have so much peace?
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:28.060]   Why do you have so much joy?
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.860]   And that they would go, take me, bring me,
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.420]   share with me, help me, let's go out for coffee,
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.100]   let's talk about this more.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.700]   Lord, I pray that you would release this church
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.900]   into the city with the hope of the gospel
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.780]   and the redemptive power that there is in our testimony.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.180]   Lord, thank you for what you've done in private renewal.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   And we pray for the transformative power
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.740]   that happens in public witness.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.940]   Lord, we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.660]   Everyone says.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:00.500]   - Amen.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.700]   - Would you stand with me as a community
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.300]   and let's just join in a place of worship before the Lord
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.500]   as we thank him for what he's doing in our lives.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.080]   (upbeat music)
