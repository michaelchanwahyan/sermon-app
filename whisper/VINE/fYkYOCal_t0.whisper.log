[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Good morning to everyone online.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   And I wanna give a quick shout out to June and Paul.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.960]   If you watch this, just know that God can meet you
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.720]   wherever you are and that he's right there with you.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.600]   Before I start this morning, I wanna share something
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.640]   that happened on the train this morning
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.560]   as I was heading into church.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.240]   So I was on the train and I was playing my word games.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.360]   Who likes word games?
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.360]   I love word games, crosswords and word blitz,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.000]   how many words you can find in a minute,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.280]   all that kind of thing.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.600]   All the secret word game people like, not me.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.400]   So I was doing that on the train coming in
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400]   and I just felt challenged by God to stop and be still.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.760]   So I shut off my phone and closed my eyes.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.240]   And I said to God, can you really meet me in all of this?
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.240]   If you're a public transport person like I am,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.840]   you know, there was a lady across from me
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.320]   who was listening to tunes without her earphones,
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.360]   having a great time, you know.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.560]   So in my heart, I said,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.000]   God, can you really meet me in this?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And he immediately said to me, I can, I can, but can you?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.640]   And then I heard him say,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.160]   Susanna, I'm bringing all of myself to this.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.760]   I'm not holding anything back.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.960]   I'm bringing all of my power, all of my presence.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.360]   Can you match me today?
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.720]   Can you bring all of yourself?
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.960]   Not leaving any part of you behind.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.760]   And I'm sharing that with you
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.280]   because I don't believe it's a challenge just for me.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.800]   I believe it's a challenge for all of us today
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.920]   to take a moment to choose,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.680]   to bring all of ourselves into this moment, to be present.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.680]   To not leave parts of our life hidden
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.200]   or away from God's presence
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.920]   as if he doesn't already know they exist,
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.120]   but to bring it all,
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.160]   to match him as he has come bringing all of himself to us.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.800]   The promise of better days
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.680]   those who cannot remember the past
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.000]   are condemned to repeat it.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.760]   This was spoken by a philosopher, George Santayana.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000]   And in the book of Matthew,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.560]   we see Matthew taking the opportunity
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.880]   to remind the Jewish people of their past,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.040]   calling on them to not forget,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.720]   calling on them to make the connection to Jesus
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.040]   and why he came,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.840]   to bring them out of Egypt, that symbol of enslavement,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.680]   to bring them into freedom and healing and hope.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.040]   So we pick up the story in Matthew 2.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.480]   The Magi have been to visit Jesus.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.920]   They've brought their gifts of gold and myrrh
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.480]   and frankincense.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.840]   And Herod knows that a child
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.000]   prophesied to be the King of the Jews
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.760]   has been born.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.000]   And he says to the Magi, "Come and tell me,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   when you find this child, come back to me
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.040]   and tell me where this child is."
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.800]   The Magi get warned in a dream not to do that.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.160]   So in Matthew 2, verses 13 to 14, it says,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.520]   "When they, the Magi, had gone,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.800]   an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.320]   'Get up,' he said, 'take the child and his mother
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.200]   and escape to Egypt.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.880]   Stay there until I tell you,
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.560]   for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.'
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.480]   So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   and left for Egypt,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.080]   where he stayed until the death of Herod.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.640]   And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   through the prophet, 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'"
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   In this passage, Matthew mentions Jesus' escape to Egypt
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.240]   and His return from Egypt
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.080]   in order to remind the Jewish people of the Old Testament,
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   prophetic hope of the Messiah coming out of Egypt.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.800]   This line, "Out of Egypt I called my son,"
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.440]   is a direct quote from the prophet Hosea.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.920]   In Hosea chapter 11, verses one to four,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.120]   he prophesies, "When Israel was a child, I loved him
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.560]   and out of Egypt I called my son.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   But the more they were called,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.640]   the more they went away from me.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.360]   They sacrificed to the Baals
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.800]   and they burned incense to images.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.560]   It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.640]   taking them by the arms,
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.160]   but they did not realise it was I who healed them.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.760]   I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.480]   To them I was like one who lifts a child to the cheek,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.280]   and I bent down to feed them."
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.960]   The Old Testament foreshadows
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.680]   what's to come in the New Testament.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.560]   Here in this passage, Hosea is reminding the people
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.960]   that God brought Israel out of Egypt,
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.000]   freeing them from all that enslaved them
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.360]   and reigniting their hope for the future.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.320]   Interestingly, this is one of the rare moments in the Bible
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.400]   where God is presented to us from a feminine perspective
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.160]   as a mother bending over to feed her son.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.120]   Here we are reminded that God represents the fullness
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.040]   of both the feminine and the masculine,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.960]   that Adam and Eve were brought forth out of God's own image.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.760]   This passage in Hosea provides us with a great window
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.880]   into the nurturing side of God.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.080]   We see God lifting his children,
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.920]   tending to them, nourishing them,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.160]   mothering them out of this season,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.160]   this hard, struggling season they've just had in Egypt.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.000]   We need to remember when Hosea was writing this,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.280]   who he was writing it to and why he was writing it.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.600]   So Hosea was an eighth century BC prophet,
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.880]   and he's speaking about Israel coming out of Egypt,
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.600]   which was 1500 years before Christ.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.480]   Okay, so keep this all in your head.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.120]   So Hosea is prophesying about and drawing from the past
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.240]   1500 years before the birth of Christ.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.920]   He's living in the eighth century.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.080]   And in this passage, he's prophesying
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.360]   to the 10 northern tribes,
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   and they are in this very moment facing a war with Assyria.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.400]   They are deeply in need of these comforting words
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.760]   that he brings them, this reminder of God's care.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:34.000]   Hosea is drawing on God's faithfulness in the past
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.120]   to ignite hope in the hearts of God's people.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   Now we jump forward from Hosea to the birth of Jesus,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.080]   first century AD.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.760]   And Matthew, after the birth of Jesus,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.520]   once again draws from the past,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   draws from the words of Hosea, quoting his words.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.760]   To once again remind the Jewish people
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.960]   of God's faithfulness,
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.960]   that their longing for a Messiah had now been fulfilled.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.680]   I wanna go back and listen to Hosea's words,
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.600]   this prophecy that Matthew is drawing from.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.920]   "But the more they were called,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.160]   "the more they went away from me."
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.840]   Israel, after being freed physically,
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.400]   being brought out of Egypt,
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.240]   out of their oppression,
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.720]   are unable to keep their hearts free.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.520]   They return back to enslavement,
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.320]   not to be enslaved by others,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.360]   but this time to be enslaved themselves,
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.000]   and to enslave themselves.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.360]   With Jesus's birth, there's like this do-over
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.000]   where God symbolically shows through Jesus
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.880]   what He truly intended for His people.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.960]   Jesus is brought up out of Egypt, just as Israel was,
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.280]   and where Israel fails to walk forward in their freedom,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   their healing, Jesus, through His ongoing life and ministry,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.680]   demonstrates how to walk forward in obedience,
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.320]   fulfilling the plans God has for Him
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.320]   to bring life and freedom and healing to all peoples.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.240]   Let's look at this a little deeper here,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.960]   because I believe there are some parallels in this story
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.160]   that link to us today,
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.280]   that as we head into this Christmas period,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.960]   I believe God wants to awaken us to.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.160]   Some 1,500 years before Jesus's birth,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.640]   Israel's in captivity.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.480]   They're enslaved in such a way
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   that they're only able to live limited, contained lives.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.520]   Then God comes with His servant Moses
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.160]   and miraculously frees them.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.720]   They are set free physically.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.080]   The Scriptures we mentioned early in Hosea
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.080]   show us that God wraps His people up in His tenderness.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.080]   The imagery of a mother with her son,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.320]   teaching them to walk, wrapping them up in her arms,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.800]   healing them, leading them with kindness and love,
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.120]   lifting them, feeding them.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.720]   But with all this tenderness,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   the people of Israel seem unable
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.080]   to recognise God's presence in their life.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   Hosea captures this in verse three.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.120]   "It was I," this is God speaking,
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.160]   "It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.680]   taking them by the arms,
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   but they did not realise that it was I who healed them."
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.720]   Has this ever bothered you?
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.200]   It's bothered me.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.080]   Israel has just witnessed these incredible miracles.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.440]   The 10 plagues of Egypt
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   have systematically dismantled the gods of Egypt.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.200]   And Israel has seen that with their own eyes.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.640]   They then see the parting of the Red Sea.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.240]   They walk through it, they experience it.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.680]   But then at the first moments of hunger,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.600]   oh, it would have been better for us back in Egypt.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.960]   When Moses stays too long on the mountain,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.080]   they create their own Baal,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.400]   a god from the land that they were imprisoned in
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.160]   for hundreds of years.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.040]   Their minds and their hearts return them
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.880]   to the place in which they were enslaved,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.040]   in which they were limited, in which they were contained.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.440]   Their thinking, their feelings, their actions
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.120]   are still being impacted by their past.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.600]   There is something seriously amiss here.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.120]   So I went researching
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.320]   and I read an article
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.640]   called "The Psychological Impact of Imprisonment."
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.720]   Not my usual reading,
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.640]   but it was a research paper written
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.200]   for the US Department of Health and Human Services
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.120]   that looked at the impact
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.920]   of long-term imprisonment on people,
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.320]   and it said this.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.640]   Imprisonment, as in the removal of freedoms
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.240]   from people for extended periods of time,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.160]   creates habits of thinking, feeling, and acting
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.000]   that can be dysfunctional.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.320]   People become more and more accustomed
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.640]   to the restrictions that an enslaved
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.040]   or an imprisoned life imposes,
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   so much so that these limitations become natural to them,
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.760]   that even when these conditions of life change,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.440]   so even when people are released,
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.320]   when the limitations are removed,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.920]   the counterproductive patterns remain.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.720]   This is what it feels like
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.360]   reading this story of the Israelites.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.920]   It feels dysfunctional.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.480]   It feels like that they easily return
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.840]   to the habits that have enslaved them.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:50.360]   How does this all relate to us in this Advent season?
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.280]   We have only been through three years of hardship,
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.080]   but in these three years, our lives have been limited.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.280]   They have been contained.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.080]   They have been constrained.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.800]   We have had freedoms taken from us.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.680]   Many of us have been limited, unable to work,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.440]   unable to travel, unable to play sport.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.280]   Many of us have been imprisoned by crippling anxiety.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.840]   Feelings of being overwhelmed and trapped
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   and feeling like there's no hope.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:32.640]   And here in this moment, as we have Matthew reminding us
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.000]   that Jesus's coming heralds a new era of freedom,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.080]   healing, hope for our future,
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   I wonder whether we might carry
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.640]   some of the same heart and head issues
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.960]   that the Israelites carried with them out of Egypt.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.760]   We may be starting to regain some of our physical freedoms,
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.800]   but I wonder whether the restrictions
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.640]   and the limitations we've experienced
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.080]   are continuing to keep us looking back
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.560]   instead of looking forward with hope.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.920]   In this Advent season,
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   can we clearly recognise God's presence and hope in our lives?
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   Or have the last three years formed habits in our minds
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   and in our hearts that are holding us back,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.400]   keeping us enslaved, contained?
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.600]   I wonder whether we have become used
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.520]   to living limited, restricted lives.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:44.840]   I wonder whether we become used to
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   being so limited in our lives,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   so limited in our lives that we forget God.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.600]   It's so much that it actually feels natural.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.360]   There is another part of this story
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.080]   that I believe God is highlighting to us today
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.720]   in this Advent season.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.360]   Let me read those first verses again from Hosea.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.080]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.400]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.680]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.080]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.320]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.640]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.960]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.280]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.600]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.920]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.200]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.560]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.880]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.200]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.600]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.920]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.280]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.600]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.920]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.240]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.680]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.360]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.680]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.000]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.400]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.680]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.440]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.880]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.280]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.600]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.000]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.480]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.960]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.400]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.840]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.320]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.800]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.320]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.680]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.320]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.880]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.520]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.120]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.680]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.320]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.080]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.800]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.520]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.320]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.080]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.880]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.680]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.520]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.480]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.320]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.120]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.920]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.720]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.520]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.400]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.280]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.240]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.120]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.080]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.040]   And I'm gonna read those to you.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   After the three days, let her do her four days of quarantine at home.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   Don't send her to an isolation hotel as well.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   But I was told, "No, no, she'll get COVID.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.040]   She's in the room with you."
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   So I felt like I lost a lot of freedom.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   Sabae was picked up and she was taken to an isolation hotel.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   In that moment when she was taken out the door,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   so literally the door shut behind her,
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   I just burst into tears.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   And I was like, "God, it's so unfair.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.040]   And why can't you just intervene?"
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   I was then taken to a different isolation hotel in a prison bus.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   No, not really.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   It just felt like a prison bus.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   Some of you were like, "Really? Prison bus came to take you?"
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.040]   No, not really.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.040]   But it felt like it.
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.040]   You know, you're already feeling sick.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   And I'd come from Australia, so I had bags and bags and things
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.040]   hanging off me and I'm trying to get on this bus.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.040]   And nobody comes within 10 metres of you.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   Even the driver has sheets and sheets of plastic taped up
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.040]   so none of my air can get into him, you know.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   And when I got to the isolation hotel,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:29.040]   I collapsed on the bed and everything came to a shuddering halt.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   All I had was stillness.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.040]   All I had was waiting.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   And did I embrace this stillness?
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   Did I see it as an opportunity, as a gift?
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   No.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   After lots of frustrating tears, I went into survival mode.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.040]   I went into doing.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   I dived into distractions.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   I switched off my thinking and emotions and I buried myself in Netflix.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.040]   (Laughter)
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   It would have remained like this except God did intervene,
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   but not in the ways I'd asked him to.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   He found me in my waiting and encouraged me to finally be still with him.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.040]   This is an extract from my journal.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   Thank you.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.040]   Who knew that catching COVID would bring me to my knees
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   and to a shuddering halt?
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   And I'm thankful.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.040]   In the depths of these dark days, I've gained perspective.
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   I had grown so fragile, so brittle,
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   that any problem threatened to break me.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   Years of stuff built up, stuff piled upon stuff,
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   getting more and more rigid.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   So catching COVID and the dramas that came with it shattered me,
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.040]   turned me into a blubbering mess.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   But it also gave me time to be still,
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   to watch the clouds drift across the sky
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   and to hear God's voice afresh.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.040]   Be still and know that I am God.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   Matthew, speaking about the first Christmas,
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   was asking the Jewish people to do the same thing,
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   to be still and recognise that this child that had been born was God,
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   was the one they had been longing for.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.040]   In true stillness, we find God afresh.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   However, like the Israelites waiting for Moses,
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   we don't deal well with stillness.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:02.040]   Instead, habits like constantly checking our social media feeds,
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   which some of you are probably doing right now,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   playing games on our phones, it all numbs us.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.040]   We dull ourselves to what is happening around us.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.040]   We miss the beauty and we miss God's presence.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:23.040]   We, like the Israelites, begin to fail to recognise His nearness
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   and His interventions into our life.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   Maybe this Christmas is remembering that Jesus came out of Egypt
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   so that we could all come out of Egypt,
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   that we're not meant to stay wandering in the desert,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   living limited lives.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   Jesus came to make sure our lives were filled with love.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   He came so we can experience healing and move fully out of all that enslaves us
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   into a future of hope.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   Matthew is reminding us this Christmas that the mothering heart of God,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   shown in Hosea, is now ours through Jesus.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   In Jesus, we have the healing, the care, the feeding, the nurturing
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   that were shown in this Hosea passage.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   You know, one of the things that I love the most about raising my children,
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   I have four children,
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   that when they were babies and I was breastfeeding them,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   the thing that I used to love the most was feeding them in the night,
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.040]   in the quiet.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.040]   There was this beautiful connection that I can't describe.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   And some of us today need to experience that mothering heart of God.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   We need to stay still long enough for us to recognise His nearness
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.040]   and His tender-heartedness towards us.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.040]   This is great news for us this Christmas,
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   that in the midst of suffering and hardship and struggle and disillusionment
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.040]   and brokenness, Jesus comes with the tenderness of a mother
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   bending towards us, her children, to comfort us and restore our hope.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   So how is your hope right at this moment?
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:31.040]   What kind of state is your heart in?
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.040]   How is your pace of life?
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   Is there any true stillness?
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   I don't know about you, but in the seasons we have endured
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.040]   and are continuing to endure,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.040]   it's been pretty easy to live a constrained life.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:58.040]   Get up, get through the day, reset, repeat.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   Who knows what I'm talking about?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   Not really thinking or reflecting on what the changes in our world
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   and in our city have done to our hearts, have done to our hope.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   So I ask you again, how is your hope right at this moment?
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   What kind of state is your heart in? Do you know?
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.040]   Matthew speaking about the original Christmas was trying to ignite hope
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   in the hearts of his Jewish readers, to remind them that Jesus' birth
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.040]   could bring them out of their slavery, could set them free.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   Christmas is about hope.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.040]   Maybe this Christmas is about reigniting hope,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   of stopping long enough, being still, to examine our battered hearts.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   And allowing the mothering heart of God to come alongside,
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:10.040]   to bring his healing, to bring genuine release from all that weighs us down.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   Can I just invite the band to head back up?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   As we draw to a close, there are some areas that I believe God
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.040]   wants to mother us in today.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   And I'd like to invite you to just close your eyes
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.040]   and just hear these things.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   Let them wash over you and just see whether some resonate,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:37.040]   whether there's something that God just puts his finger on and says,
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   "That, that's what I want to do for you today."
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   God wants to deal with the impact of isolation,
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   the impact that the shutting off and the withdrawing of freedoms
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.040]   has had on our hearts.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   He wants to set us free from living limited and constrained lives.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:04.040]   He wants to deal with the habits of thinking, feeling and acting
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:09.040]   that have developed, that are causing dysfunction in our lives.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   Physical habits, like over eating, over working, over drinking,
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:21.040]   over gaming, Netflix binging.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   And mental habits, survival thinking, a mind that can't shut off,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.040]   a mind that worries, is anxious, a mind that can't be still.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   He wants to address feelings of hopelessness.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   Some of you today have a deep sense of futurelessness.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.040]   When you look at the future, you can't see it for you.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.040]   God wants to wrap you up in his arms today
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   and tenderly speak hope back into your life and your future.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   Jesus came out of Egypt to show us that he can free us
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.040]   from every enslavement, both physical and mental.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   We have a God who seeks to nurture us, to nourish us,
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.040]   to care for us, to heal us, to love us.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:32.040]   So my question to you today is, can you be still
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.040]   and recognise his nearness because he's here.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.040]   He's brought all that he is here.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   Let's stand together.
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   We're going to take some time to be still.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.040]   Stillness doesn't come easy.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.040]   It's something we actually need to practise here in Hong Kong
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   because as soon as we say, "Okay, I'm going to be still
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   and I'm going to listen to God," suddenly we find ourselves
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.040]   in the kitchen making a cup of coffee and wondering
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   how we got there because our minds just do not stop.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   So we have to practise stillness.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   We have to learn how to, when the distractions come,
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   to stop them and push them back out and to say,
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   "No, no, no, no, no. I'm here with Jesus."
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   So right now, push out the distractions.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.040]   (soft music)
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   And hold out your hands.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:55.040]   And in your hands, picture the things that maybe have come
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   into your heart as we've spoken this morning,
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.040]   the things that maybe you feel a tug,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   maybe something not quite right.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.040]   And just see it in your hands as you just offer it to Jesus.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   Turn up with all that you are, all of your brokenness,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.040]   all of the pieces.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:27.040]   And right now, just be still
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   and allow the tender-heartedness of God
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   to wrap around you.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   (soft music)
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.040]   To hold you, to heal you,
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   to pour such deep reservoirs of love over you
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.040]   that you'll feel like you're drowning in it
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   'cause it can't be measured.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   It's so deep and wide and never-ending.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.040]   Let's be still and listen.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   (soft music)
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:35.040]   For those of you online, wherever you are right now,
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   whether you're on a bus or a train or at home or at work,
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   God is with you.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:48.040]   And it's no mistake you're listening to this message.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.040]   Whether you're listening to it right now
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.040]   or you're listening to it in a month's time,
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:59.040]   God knew and He's with you.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.040]   (soft music)
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   The band's gonna start to sing over us.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   If you would like prayer,
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   then keep your hands open in front of you
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.040]   and I'm gonna encourage this body
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   to be brave and to become
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.040]   the mothering heart of God for you today.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   To come alongside and speak encouragement and life into you.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   Let's just take some time to do that now.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   (soft music)
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   Can I encourage you to,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.040]   I can see many people with their hands in front of them.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   Can I encourage you,
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:02.040]   if you're a Christian
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.040]   and you carry the presence of God within you,
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   that means you carry both the mothering
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   and fathering heart of God within you.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   You have the capacity for this.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.040]   So look around you and find someone
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.040]   and trust that God can flow through you
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.040]   and be a blessing to that person.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.040]   Let's do that for each other right now.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.620]   (gentle music)
