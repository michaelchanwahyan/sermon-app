[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   (gentle music)
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.760]   Everyone says, hey, can we thank our worship team as always?
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.520]   And as you sit down,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.520]   please try to move into the middle of the row
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.360]   as much as possible.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.400]   We are totally, totally overflown.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.080]   We have a whole group of people out in the overflow.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.320]   Hey guys, great to have you with us in the overflow today.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.120]   We know that there are people standing on the stairs
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.300]   down the Cape of Sea.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.920]   There are people upstairs as well standing on the stairs.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.980]   So if you have a spare seat next to you,
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.080]   can you please just, yeah, raise your hand.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.760]   There's three seats right here, hosts.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.960]   Three seats right here.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.800]   There's a couple of seats over here.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.080]   Come on in if you are outside and in need of a seat.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.680]   And we are so grateful.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.600]   We know people are sitting on stairs and stuff as well.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.160]   So it's a good problem when church is full,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040]   but we wanna make sure that everybody feels comfortable
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.880]   and that we make sure that we have a room for everybody
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.720]   that's possible.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.480]   Just a reminder, we have three services on a Sunday,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480]   9.15, 11 o'clock and two o'clock.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.620]   I know 11 is the very convenient service
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.740]   'cause it means you get to sleep in
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.740]   and then you can go out for lunch.
[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.700]   But if you want to, you can visit the two o'clock
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.540]   at any time.
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.980]   We would love to have you at the two o'clock or the 9.15.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.860]   But welcome to church.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.680]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.180]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.500]   And we're continuing our series in Exodus.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.580]   There's a couple of chairs here.
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.700]   I think there's two chairs right there, possibly.
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.780]   There's a chair, you can sit in my chair.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.840]   I don't own my chair, my chairs.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.220]   There's two chairs here.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.020]   There's a chair down here.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.900]   Awesome.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.100]   All right, I'm gonna stop speaking about chairs
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.660]   and start speaking about Jesus.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.400]   So,
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.200]   are you okay?
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.020]   You got a chair?
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.220]   You got a chair, awesome.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.060]   Good to see you.
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.140]   So on Tuesday, April 17th, 2017,
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.220]   at exactly 11.15 in the morning,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.780]   I saved somebody's life.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.420]   And by that, I mean I literally saved their life.
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.380]   Like I'm convinced that if I had not been
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.640]   in that exact place at that exact time,
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.740]   the other person most definitely,
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.420]   without a shadow of doubt, have died.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.660]   I was in China at the time.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.820]   I was in the South of China at a resort,
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.260]   having a holiday with my wife, just the two of us.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.900]   We decided to go on like a second honeymoon.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900]   We left our daughter Mia at home.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.860]   We went with two friends of ours.
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.500]   And it just so happened that the husband
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.740]   that we were traveling with, with these other friends,
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.880]   he was a senior member of the hotel group
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.440]   that we were staying at and the place
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.800]   that we were staying in.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800]   And on April 11th, we had this incredible breakfast,
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.160]   late breakfast.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.680]   We'd slept in, had this great breakfast.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.640]   And after breakfast, we decided that we wanted to go
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.000]   to the one pool in the complex.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.920]   There was about four pools in the complex.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.240]   We wanted to go to the one where kids were not allowed.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.360]   'Cause you know, when you're a parent
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.560]   and you travel without your kids,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.040]   you wanna be without kids.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.060]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.740]   So we found the one pool in the resort
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.020]   where kids are banned, not allowed to go to.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.380]   We go over there, we arrived there,
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.620]   and there are no other people in this pool.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.420]   No one is around the pool at all.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.300]   No one's swimming there or anything like that.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.660]   So we think this is fantastic.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.620]   We're all on our own.
[00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.540]   So we basically find these two lounge chairs
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.660]   on the side of the pool.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.260]   We sit down, we start to get ourselves nice and relaxed
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.360]   and everything like that.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.580]   Within about three minutes or so,
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.200]   two people arrive in the pool.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.540]   Now, there are three things you need to know
[00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.640]   about these two people.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.420]   The first is, it was pretty obvious
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.380]   that this was a daughter and her mother.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.160]   The daughter was probably in her late thirties.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.460]   The mother, I would say maybe late sixties,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.300]   something like that.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.740]   It was a mother and a daughter.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.340]   The second thing you need to know about them
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.740]   was that they were fully clothed, okay?
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.260]   They were not dressed for the beach or the pool.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.660]   They were fully clothed completely.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.900]   And by the time, while they were walking around the pool
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.820]   and talking to each other,
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.940]   they were talking in Mandarin Chinese.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.780]   I don't speak Mandarin,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.080]   so didn't know what they were saying,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.020]   but I could tell by their gestures
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.980]   and the way they're talking
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.180]   that neither of them could swim.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.140]   The third thing you need to know about this couple
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.300]   was that the mother was carrying with her
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.220]   one of those massive inflatable unicorn things
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.060]   that you see in the pool.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.180]   You know, those really annoying unicorn things
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.580]   that people like to lie on for the gram, right?
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.340]   This almost 70 year old mother
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.840]   was carrying one under her arm,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.540]   which I thought was bizarre
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.860]   'cause they were wearing clothes
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.400]   and it was very obvious that they cannot swim.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.620]   So I was kind of keeping half an eye on them over my book.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.180]   You know, anyone else people watch when you're on holiday?
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.940]   Come on, you know you do.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.780]   You know you do.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.360]   I'm sitting there and I'm like, this is bizarre.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.460]   Sure enough, the daughter goes down by the stairs
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.020]   of the shallow end and she calls her mother over.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.700]   She puts the big unicorn floatie in the pool
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.860]   and she gestures for her mother to sit on the floatie.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.960]   As she's doing this, she gets out her camera.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   And by this point, I'm like, this is not going to end well.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.780]   And as her mother sits on the floatie,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.100]   she then pushes her mother out to the middle of the pool.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.380]   Like just pushes the floatie out
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.860]   and gets her camera ready for the photo of her lifetime.
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.160]   At this point, I know disaster is looming.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.700]   And this mother floats out to the middle of the pool
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.180]   and she tries to adjust her balance
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.980]   on this awkward floatie thing.
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.340]   And she leans forward and she flips it
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.840]   and she goes straight into the middle of the pool.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.460]   I don't even think.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.700]   I jump up from my chair.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.540]   I run as fast as I can, 'cause I'm gonna save this woman.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.660]   As I'm running, I realized something.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.020]   I am also fully clothed.
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.380]   I have also just come from breakfast
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.420]   and I did not get changed at all.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.540]   And I'm fully clothed.
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.940]   So as I'm running, I realized I'm wearing my glasses.
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.280]   I'm wearing my hat.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.100]   So I whip off my glasses.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.460]   I throw off my hat whilst I'm running.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.420]   I get to the edge of the pool.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.060]   It was literally a Superman moment,
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.860]   you know, taking the clothes off.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.300]   I dive into the swimming pool.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.900]   I swim under the water and I come up right under her
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.780]   as she's drowning.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.340]   She's drowning there.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.740]   Her daughter is screaming her head off,
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.420]   standing at the side of the pool.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.820]   Now, the thing that saves my life and hers
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.620]   is that as I got to her,
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.340]   I realized I could stand on the bottom of the pool
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.060]   and just keep my head above water.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.500]   Just keep my head above water.
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.900]   So I'm standing there just with my head above water.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.820]   I flip her around 'cause she was facing down to the water.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.080]   I flip her around and push her head up
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.780]   so that she can kind of see properly.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.780]   I then get her in like a fireman's kind of lift thing
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.620]   like this.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.980]   And I like as best I can kind of maneuver over
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.700]   to the stairs in the shallow end.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.460]   Her daughter is there.
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.620]   She grabs her by the end.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.440]   She yanks her up and they walk away.
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.980]   And I, I come up out of the water.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.740]   I literally collapse on the deck of the pool,
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.920]   absolutely exhausted, but feeling like a hero.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.980]   Now, yeah.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:29.540]   Now my friend, who's a senior member of this hotel group,
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.860]   hears about this heroic action from this white guy
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.620]   at the swimming pool.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.820]   And because of his connections,
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.580]   he was able to get the CCTV footage of this moment.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.700]   Do you want to watch?
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.660]   Yeah, all right, here we go.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.740]   Here it is, okay.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.580]   Here she is.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.380]   Okay, no, this is my wife, my wife here.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.220]   Look at her.
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.220]   She's like not sure.
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.540]   She's trying to get balanced.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.420]   Oh, get balanced.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.180]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.000]   Okay, here we go.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.300]   Look down here, look down here.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.140]   Yeah.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.380]   Yes.
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.880]   (congregation applauding)
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.620]   Now I'm like, I got her like, like I'm trying to work out.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.100]   I'm trying to get her breathing.
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.700]   Finally, the pool guy shows up.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.060]   Thank you.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.300]   Like I got her in a fireman.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.140]   Look, there she is.
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.900]   I got her in like this fireman's posy thing right there.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.900]   I'm helping her and I save her life in the name of Jesus.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.780]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.620]   Not just a pastor.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.340]   Real life superhero.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.260]   I love my dive.
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.980]   My dive's like a really awkward dive.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.900]   Anyway, you're probably wondering
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.260]   what has this got to do with the Exodus, right?
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.940]   Today we come to the story of Moses,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.820]   a story which is birthed in this idea
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.060]   of somebody who reaches into the waters of death
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.620]   and brings somebody back to life.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.380]   Last week when we were looking at the Exodus journey,
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.180]   we saw that this new Pharaoh comes to power in Egypt
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.520]   and out of both his own insecurities
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.820]   and the fear that he has
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.260]   for this large immigrant community in his land,
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.980]   he decides to throw them under slavery.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.340]   He decides to oppress them, to disempower them.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.620]   And he starts by enslaving them as we looked at last week,
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.060]   but then he decides very quickly
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.820]   to move from slavery to genocide.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.940]   And he's worried about this rising army
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.860]   that could rise up amongst this group.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.660]   And so he decides that he's going to kill every male boy.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.340]   Now to do that, he calls on the midwives,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.500]   the Israelite midwives,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.080]   to actually do the process of killing.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.060]   So as they're delivering the children,
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.780]   if they deliver a boy, they kill it.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.140]   If they deliver a girl, they let it live.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.620]   Now there are two incredibly brave midwives,
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.980]   as we saw last week,
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.460]   who decide that no, they're not gonna do this.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.940]   They decide that they're not gonna bring into genocide
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.400]   those of their own flesh and blood,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.660]   and they defy the order of Pharaoh.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.380]   And when we pick up the story here this morning
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.380]   is right at this moment after the two women
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.820]   have defied Pharaoh,
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.580]   and Pharaoh realizes that his plans had been thwarted.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.460]   Let me read this to you from Exodus 1, verse 22.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.380]   Then Pharaoh gave this order to all of his people.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.520]   Every boy that is born, you must throw into the Nile,
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.480]   but every girl can live.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.660]   Pharaoh, knowing that he's been thwarted
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.500]   by these two incredibly brave Hebrew midwives,
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.700]   then turns to his people,
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.180]   rather than getting the Israelites to try to kill Israelites,
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.420]   he turns to his own people,
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.100]   and he says, "Here's what I want you to do.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.920]   If you come across an Israel, a Hebrew boy,
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.180]   who's young, a child, I want you to grab that boy,
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.500]   and I want you to throw it into the Nile."
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.220]   Now, this is not a suggestion.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.620]   This is a decree and a command of Pharaoh.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.620]   And every Egyptian who is loyal to Pharaoh,
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.740]   which they all had to be,
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.020]   anytime they saw a Hebrew boy, this is what they should do.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.940]   Pick up that child and literally throw him into the water.
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.860]   The word here, throw him, is really important.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.340]   Throw them or throw into is really important.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.060]   That word, remember, Moses is writing this,
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.580]   that word is a Hebrew word
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.820]   that means literally to abandon.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.440]   And I want you to see what Moses is doing
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.100]   right at the start of this story.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.460]   He's wanting us to understand what evil
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:26.060]   and what the enemy is always trying to do through slavery.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.820]   He's always trying to abandon us from what is around us.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.740]   Pharaoh decides that the best way that he can do this
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.300]   is abandon this child.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.940]   And to abandon this child,
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.460]   to do this to the Israelites themselves,
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.300]   is to pick up the child and throw it in the water,
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.020]   to abandon it to the family,
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.580]   abandon it to their community,
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.900]   and abandon it, of course, to death.
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.420]   And this power of abandonment, as Moses is writing this,
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.460]   is wanting us to understand that this is not just a moment
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.780]   that Pharaoh is doing,
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.780]   this is something that's seeped into the reality
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.020]   of what all of our sin does.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.700]   See, in our slavery to sin,
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.820]   sin is always at work to try to abandon us
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.940]   to our families, our careers, our loved ones,
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.180]   the things that are around us.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.300]   You talk to anybody who has had the travesty
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.980]   of the slavery of addiction,
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.260]   and they'll tell you that story.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.340]   You meet anyone who's been addicted to gambling,
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.740]   they will tell you that they've abandoned their possessions
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.620]   and were willing to abandon their possessions
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.180]   in order to feed that addiction.
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.700]   You talk to anybody who's been addicted to pornography
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.740]   or addicted to drugs,
[00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.820]   you'll find that they will do whatever it takes
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.420]   to abandon their family and their friends and their time
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.300]   to the things that they're addicted to.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.020]   But it's not just addiction, it's any sin.
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.100]   Any sin that you are held captive to
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.900]   is at work within you to abandon you to what is around you.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.180]   That's the work of sin.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.940]   That's what the enemy is trying to do in your life.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.780]   And it's important as you're on your own journey of Exodus,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.260]   as you're thinking about what it means for you
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.180]   to go from slavery to greater freedom in your life,
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.060]   you need to realize that what sin is trying to do
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.660]   is abandon you to all that is good in your life,
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.820]   to strip that away from you.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.380]   And one of the starting points
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:22.380]   of all of our journey in Exodus is to refuse to be abandoned,
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.780]   to refuse to move with an abandoned spirit.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.380]   I want you to know this,
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.100]   that the greatest spiritual work that the enemy has
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.580]   over the global church is to fill the church with orphans,
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.580]   to fill the church with orphans in the spirit,
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:45.620]   those that feel alone, those that feel abandoned,
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.260]   those that feel given up on,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.900]   those that feel separated from everybody else.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.620]   And not just with an orphan spirit about themselves
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.180]   and the people around them, but most importantly,
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.740]   this is the work of the enemy
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.500]   to make us feel like we're an orphan to God,
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.660]   to make us feel like we're abandoned by him,
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.180]   that he has left us alone.
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.460]   And right at the start of this story,
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.100]   and Moses is about to unpack for us something incredible,
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.780]   he wants you to understand that the gateway into this story
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.220]   is the work that the enemy does
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.860]   through the reality of sin to abandon us.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:22.060]   Now, he then says they're being abandoned into the Nile.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.140]   Now, this is really important because the Nile,
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.460]   this is the first mention of the Nile
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.420]   in the whole of the book of Exodus.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.220]   And the Nile is gonna go on to dominate
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.820]   actually some of the integrable moments
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.860]   of the early part of the Exodus story.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.700]   You know, the five movements I've been teaching you
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.540]   throughout the series so far,
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.300]   slavery, promise, liberation, identity, and home,
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.620]   the first three of those, slavery, promise, and liberation,
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.020]   all are integral to the work of the Nile.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.220]   The Nile features in critical moments
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.260]   of those three movements.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.860]   And this is the first time we hear about the Nile.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.940]   And you need to understand why the Nile
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.540]   was super important to the Egyptian people
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.260]   and how the Nile is then used by God to flip the story,
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.740]   flip the script, and use the Nile
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.540]   as a liberating place for God's people.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.940]   And to help you to understand that,
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.460]   I wanna take you today to the banks
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.380]   of the River Nile in Egypt.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.280]   Let's take a look.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:29.940]   "Flowing some 4,180 miles
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.900]   "and covering one-sixth of the Earth's circumference,
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.980]   "the Nile River is almost twice as long
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.980]   "as the Mississippi, the Tigris, the Euphrates,
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.540]   "and the Colorado Rivers combined.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.620]   "The river is formed from two sources.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.900]   "The white Nile begins in Central Africa,
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:47.980]   "and the blue Nile begins in the Ethiopian highlands.
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.980]   "They merge together in Khartoum,
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.700]   "where they flow some further 1,600 miles
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.700]   "to the Mediterranean."
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.300]   Historians believe that Egyptian civilization
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.340]   began about 6,000 years before Christ,
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.860]   as early settlements began to pop up around the Nile,
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.420]   not too far from where I'm standing right now.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.620]   And not surprisingly, the Nile became a source
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.140]   of all life for Egyptians,
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.180]   and became the center imagery
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.380]   in so much of their mythology.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.380]   But I think it was Napoleon who put it best
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.660]   when describing Egypt to his contemporaries.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.120]   He said, "In the Nile, Egypt has the spirit of good.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.860]   "In the desert, the spirit of evil."
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.180]   And I think Israel would not disagree,
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.780]   because the Nile would be the good
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.360]   that begins their journey,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.580]   but the desert, the struggle that would come to define it,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.180]   and to understand all of that,
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.220]   I wanna take us on a journey down the Nile ourselves.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.800]   (gentle music)
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.640]   (water splashing)
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.480]   (water splashing)
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.320]   (water splashing)
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.160]   (water splashing)
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:17:09.220]   (fire crackling)
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.980]   (fire crackling)
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:29.620]   All slavery begins with a simple step,
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.220]   the devaluing of human life.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.220]   Once we devalue the life of another,
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.140]   we open ourselves up to perhaps the most sobering reality
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.740]   of the human condition,
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.340]   that regardless of how good or moral we might think we are,
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.480]   all of us are capable of committing
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.380]   the worst kinds of atrocities imaginable.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.640]   Enslaving the other is the potential of us all.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.660]   This is why our story starts here on the Nile,
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.460]   for it's in these very waters
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.260]   that Pharaoh orders all newborn Israelite boys
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.860]   to be thrown in.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.980]   Innocent children are murdered here
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.300]   simply because some people have decided
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.060]   that they no longer have an intrinsic value of life.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.380]   Long before God turns these waters red in the plagues,
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.360]   Pharaoh does so with the blood of a thousand Hebrew boys.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.700]   The source of all life has now become a graveyard of death.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.460]   But stories of redemption and freedom
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.980]   so often are birthed out of the very same places
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.200]   where the worst acts of humanity actually take place,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.260]   and the Nile is no exception.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.420]   For it will be in and out of these waters
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.860]   that would come two acts from incredibly courageous women
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.500]   that demonstrate to us the very first step
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.220]   that is required in any fight against evil
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.740]   and its enslavement,
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.580]   the resolute conviction of the gift of a human life.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.300]   In the midst of mass genocide,
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.220]   a Levite family bears a son.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.540]   Their culture taught them
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.060]   that he was special and valuable from birth,
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.580]   a gift from God.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.660]   This belief gives the mother the courage
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.940]   to resist the orders of an empire
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.680]   and do all that she can to try to save him,
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.060]   even if it would mean her own death in doing so.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.020]   So she takes a wicker basket,
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.580]   and in a decision of selfless courage,
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.900]   places her son amongst the reeds in the waters of the Nile.
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.820]   It was a pure act of suffering love.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.000]   The only way that she could save him
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.660]   was through the sacrifice of letting him go.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.460]   And so the boy is placed into the very waters
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.900]   his peers had been drowned in.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.640]   And as destiny would have it,
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.700]   the very daughter of the man who decreed their deaths
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.140]   is the very one who would bring him back to life.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.260]   Redemption has a way of ensuring no irony is lost.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.780]   This is the Bible's first story of adoption.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.580]   And like all stories of adoption,
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.140]   it's only made possible through the courageous acts
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.700]   of those that value the intrinsic nature of life.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:17.040]   So a Hebrew mother moved to a selfless act of sacrifice
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.820]   in order to save her son.
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.180]   Or take a Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.420]   moved to listen to her own heart
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.240]   as she stands against her father's decrees.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.500]   And behind them both,
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.620]   a God who's always moved to use ordinary people
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.620]   to do extraordinary things.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.860]   This is how any act of Exodus from hopelessness begins.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.340]   And may it also then be for us.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.100]   May you know a God who is able to draw you
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.940]   out of the darkest of waters
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.940]   so he might then adopt you into his family.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:54.880]   - Genocide, abandonment, sacrifice, release,
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.380]   the idea of being cut off,
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.860]   and yet then salvation and redemption
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.900]   within the very same context that brought that abandonment.
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.340]   This story right here has incredible power to it.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.520]   And there's so much here
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.920]   that I wanna hopefully communicate to you
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.420]   so that you can really begin what it is that,
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.980]   really understand what it is that God is doing
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.880]   in this beginning part of Exodus for you.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.020]   Let me read on from Exodus chapter two, verse one.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.260]   It says, "Now a man of the house of Levi
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.860]   married a Levite woman,
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.860]   and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.020]   When she saw that he was a good child,
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.800]   she hid him for three months.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.380]   But when she could hide him no longer,
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.760]   she got a papyrus basket for him
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.200]   and coated it with tar and pitch.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.660]   Then she placed the child in it
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.660]   and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.040]   His sister stood at a distance
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.480]   to see what would happen to him."
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.140]   It's really interesting what Moses does here
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.180]   as he's telling the story.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.800]   He's trying to bring a big contrast for you as the reader.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.540]   First of all, he's just started with this idea
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.740]   that Pharaoh has changed tactics now
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.780]   and is now abandoning all of these children
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.380]   to their death in the Nile.
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.720]   But as soon as he said that,
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.060]   he then opens up a very ordinary story to you.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.700]   He tells you a story about an ordinary Levite family
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.220]   who are just people that fell in love,
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.020]   got married and decided to have a child.
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.080]   And when we read the story,
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.820]   we think it's just kind of this light idea.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.660]   But if you think about the context of the moment,
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.740]   a couple who were Israelites at this time having a child,
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.540]   that was a very courageous decision.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.700]   It was a very brave thing to do
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.940]   because they knew the edict
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.100]   that was under the world and Egypt at this time.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.980]   They knew that Pharaoh had said that if they had a boy,
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.500]   that that boy would be murdered, boy would be slaughtered.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.640]   And so as you became pregnant in that time,
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.020]   you would have been feeling all this anxiety.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.020]   If I give birth to a girl,
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.140]   well, I guess the girl will live.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.940]   If I give birth to a boy,
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.980]   then sadness and travesty will come under us.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.180]   So just the idea of becoming pregnant
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.300]   was an incredibly risky thing to do at that time.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   But this couple decided it was a risk worth taking.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.420]   And we're told right here that she has a boy.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.540]   And it's really interesting what it says.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.220]   And this is one of the critical bits in this whole passage.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.300]   It says, "When she saw that he was a good child."
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.120]   I love this idea of the idea of him being a good child.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.300]   Now, you gotta be careful here.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.500]   This is not talking about some moral statement.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.940]   It wasn't that this child
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:31.060]   was particularly a good behaving child.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.700]   It wasn't like he was just well-behaved and never cried
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.340]   and was just so nice that she decided to keep him.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.500]   As if the implication was if it was a naughty child,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.140]   she'd throw him in the river herself.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.700]   That's not what it's saying here.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.680]   The word good here, remember, I've been saying each week
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.700]   that Moses, as he's writing this story,
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.440]   he's wanting to connect it to his other writings in Genesis.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.560]   That's what's happening here.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.920]   The word good here is exactly the same word
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.720]   that Moses writes in Genesis 1 and 2
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.080]   to describe what God thinks,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.960]   what God feels at the end of every day of creation.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.160]   He stands back from that day of creation
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.400]   and he says, "This is good."
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.600]   The idea being that this is just as I've designed it to be.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.720]   This is just as it should be.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.560]   It's not a moral statement from God.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.420]   It's a statement that the world in that moment
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.180]   is just in his will.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.180]   It looks and it is as he desires it to be.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.980]   To say that it is good is to say that it is under my control,
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.260]   it is in my hands, it is just as I want it to be,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.140]   and everything is all set.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.540]   The idea of shalom and peace
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.540]   is captured in this word of good.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.900]   So here's a Hebrew mother who's just given birth to a boy
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.900]   who should be killed, but she sees that this is good.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.440]   She stands back from creation like God does
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.520]   and she describes it as good.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.080]   What she's saying is, even though this is a boy
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.960]   and even though we're not supposed to be having boys
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.280]   at this time, I know that this is in line with God's will,
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.560]   that God has willed me to bring a son into this world
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.240]   so this child has value, this child has intrinsic worth,
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.000]   this child is good in God's eyes.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.420]   It is well with him, it is well with his soul,
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.840]   it is in line with his purposes and his promises,
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.040]   and she sees that and because of that,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.000]   it drives everything she does next.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.040]   It's like Moses is wanting you to understand
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.200]   the theological thinking of this woman
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.800]   'cause we look at her and we think,
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.240]   wow, she's incredibly brave, and Moses is saying,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.880]   you wanna know where that bravery comes from?
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.280]   It's because she can see God's goodness,
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.820]   the goodness of God in her son.
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.160]   She sees that this son is in the will of God,
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.200]   what the will is for him.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.480]   Even if this son is gonna be killed,
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.480]   it was still in the will of God and she can declare it good.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.640]   In other words, I don't judge the will of God
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.140]   by whether something goes well or not.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.880]   Come on, church.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.940]   I don't judge, she's saying, the will of God
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.720]   by whether I'm happy or not.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:08.080]   I judge the will of God by whether he declares it or not.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.440]   Does he declare this good?
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.080]   This child is good.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.920]   So that idea then drives what she does next.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.200]   She takes a papyrus basket
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.260]   and she coats it with tar and pitch.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.440]   Now, very importantly, what Moses is writing here,
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.720]   what he's saying is, he uses a word for basket here
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.000]   that he only uses in a few other times
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.520]   in the whole of his writings.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.720]   One other time that he uses it is in Genesis 6 to 8,
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.360]   chapter 6 to 8, where he's describing Noah and the ark.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.760]   The ark and the word basket is the same word.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.400]   What he's trying to communicate to us
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.240]   is that this mother who knows that this child
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.560]   is in the will of God, she then takes a basket,
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.200]   she takes a ark and she pitches,
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.440]   she puts the tar and the stuff, that waterproofs it.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.280]   Interestingly, those are exactly the same two words
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.640]   that Noah uses to make his ark
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.440]   and to make the ark waterproof.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.380]   Notice, the ark was designed to be a vessel
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.320]   that could carry humanity to safety,
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.200]   to life on the waters of death.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.480]   Are you with me?
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.960]   So Moses says, what the mother does here
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   is because he sees this child is good,
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.760]   she creates her own ark for this child.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.680]   And she places the child in her ark
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.900]   and she sets it off amongst the reeds of the Nile.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.960]   In other words, you've probably read this story before
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.560]   and you think that she's abandoning her child
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.100]   because she can't dare to see the child be killed.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.700]   Remember, it is Pharaoh that's abandoning.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.720]   She's not abandoning, she's dedicating.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.920]   She's releasing.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.320]   She's having the audacity to say,
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.940]   because this child is good,
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.600]   this is God's child more than it is my child.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.300]   And I'm gonna place this child in an ark,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.460]   in something that could be a vessel of true life for him
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.180]   and I'm going to release it in trust of God.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.680]   I'm gonna release the gift that God has given me.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.000]   I'm gonna give it back to God
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.720]   and I'm gonna set it out on this water.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.440]   The waters that should be killing him
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.440]   are gonna be waters that will bring him life.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.040]   I'm gonna put it in God's hands.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.280]   I'm gonna trust and release.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.000]   And what Moses in writing this is wanting you to understand
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   is the dichotomy that there is
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.440]   between Pharaoh that wants to abandon
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.320]   and a mother that so trusts God
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.440]   that she's willing to release the God.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   She's willing to give to God all the things that are there
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.660]   and this difference is gonna be what we're gonna see play out
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.740]   in the whole of the Exodus journey.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.740]   And this mother makes the decision
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.300]   that she's willing to release to God.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.980]   You need to understand that if you truly want freedom
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.060]   for yourself and for others,
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.020]   then you're gonna have to have the courage
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.400]   to release everything you have into the hands of God.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.860]   Come on church.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.780]   If you really wanna be on an Exodus journey,
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.700]   if you really wanna go from slavery to freedom,
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.840]   you're gonna have to have the courage
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.300]   to release all the things in your life
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.400]   into the hands of God.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.560]   You're gonna have to have the faith
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.200]   to believe that God can be at work in the things
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.300]   as you give them to him.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.420]   You're gonna have to say,
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.720]   even though I don't fully understand,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.100]   even though I don't know what's actually gonna result,
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.280]   I believe that God has a victory
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.800]   that's far greater than the victory
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.680]   I could ever defy for myself.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.000]   I'm willing to release into his hands
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.620]   and trust for his provision.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.840]   That's gonna be the journey you're all gonna be caught on.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.780]   And here's the thing,
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.600]   we're all okay with releasing the stuff
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.420]   that we wanna get rid of, amen.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.720]   Like when you hear a story about releasing stuff,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.960]   you're thinking to yourself like,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.540]   sure I'll release, I'll release the bad relationships
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.080]   that are dragging me down.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.660]   I'll release the bad habits
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.880]   that I know are not good for me.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.040]   I'll release all the mucky stuff in my life
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.720]   'cause I want the best life I can have.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.380]   Here's the challenge.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.740]   This mother gives away the greatest thing
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.980]   she had ever received, the birth of a son.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.100]   And here's the really important point.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:10.200]   Even the blessings in your life,
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.860]   if they are not wholly given over to God,
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.580]   will actually become the very things
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.580]   that will eventually enslave you.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:23.140]   Is anybody here?
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.960]   Even the blessings, even the good things,
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.220]   if we hold onto them too tightly,
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.980]   will eventually become the things
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.300]   that the enemy use to enslave us.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.420]   See, the reality is that God gives us blessings
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.060]   and the blessings of God are good things,
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.260]   but so often what happens when God blesses us
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.740]   with a great career, with great finances,
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.060]   with a great relationship,
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.180]   so often we can take the blessings of God
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.020]   and then we can magnify those things
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   and they can become an idol for us.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.260]   And the very thing that was a blessing from God
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.100]   becomes a thing that enslaves us in idolatry.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.700]   Some of you in this room are enslaved to your work,
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.900]   which was originally a gift from God to you,
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.560]   but you've now turned it into an idol
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.560]   and it's slaving you, it's driving you.
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.960]   Some of you are enslavement to the finances.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.520]   God's blessed you financially and it's been great,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.200]   but you've taken a hold of it too tightly
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.560]   and you're now controlling it
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.960]   and you're not giving God any room to use it
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.320]   and to move it through your life
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.560]   and you become enslaved by the very blessing
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.280]   that God has given you, this woman,
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.320]   in the courage that can only be found
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.780]   in understanding that God is good at all times.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.240]   She's willing to release even her greatest blessing,
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.280]   trusting that God has his will and his plan.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.740]   You will come into the greatest moments
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.020]   of freedom in your life when you're willing to let go,
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.840]   not just the bad stuff you carry,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.340]   but even hold the good stuff lightly before him.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.820]   That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be a steward
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.180]   of his stuff, doesn't mean that you don't steward
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.200]   the resource of God well,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.500]   but it does mean that we have to be careful
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.460]   that we don't allow our stewardship of something
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.400]   to become an idol.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.020]   And some of you need to just release,
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.580]   release what it is that you're holding in your hands,
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.460]   release what it is that you're experiencing in your life
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.020]   into a fullness of God's trust.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.180]   And that courage to trust him like that
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.380]   will be the starting point of your exodus.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.900]   It'll be the starting point of all that God can do.
[00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.340]   I wanna show you that although this mother
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.840]   does not abandon her child, God also does not abandon her.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.820]   Notice what happens next.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.300]   Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.260]   and her attendants were walking along the riverbank.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.260]   She saw the basket among the reeds
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.620]   and sent her slave girl to get it.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.380]   She opened it and saw the baby.
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:43.660]   He was crying and she felt sorry for him.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.940]   "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.120]   I want you to track with what happens in this moment.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.960]   So here's the mother who releases on an ark
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.860]   that she's created her child into the hands of God.
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.140]   And here comes one of the oppressors,
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.840]   not just one of the oppressors,
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.740]   but the very daughter of the one who's doing the oppressing,
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.660]   the daughter of Pharaoh.
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.540]   And she sees this basket in the reeds
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.700]   where she's gonna bathe.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.380]   She sends a slave girl to get it.
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.580]   She brings the basket to her.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.860]   She opens it up, and immediately she sees
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.020]   that this is one of the Hebrew boys.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.500]   Now, she in her mind is thinking,
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.100]   "I should kill this child."
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.260]   This is Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.020]   So the decree is not just some Pharaoh in Egypt
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.960]   that I guess I have to do because he's Pharaoh.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.600]   This is her own father.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.840]   And there is no time in her life
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.280]   that this daughter has ever disobeyed her father.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.940]   Pharaoh's daughters were powerful, influential authorities.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.280]   They were an actual representation in their symbolicism
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.900]   of the power and the might of Egypt.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.540]   There was no way that this girl
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.740]   would ever have disobeyed her dad.
[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.260]   And here she is, and she says, "This is a Hebrew boy.
[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.280]   "That means she should abandon him.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.100]   "She should throw him in the water, and she doesn't do it."
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.440]   And the question Moses wants you to ask is why?
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.420]   What makes the difference here?
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.220]   Why does she decide not to abandon the child?
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:12.780]   He tells us right here, he says,
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.620]   "He was crying, and she felt sorry for him."
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.380]   The word sorry for there is a Hebrew word
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.140]   which actually literally translates as compassion.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.360]   She felt compassion for him.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.540]   This idea of compassion is gonna be a central theme
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.500]   in the Exodus journey.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.140]   In fact, in just a couple of weeks time,
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:34.840]   we're gonna see when God decides to act
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.820]   on behalf of the Israelites,
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:39.580]   he decides to do so because he's moved with compassion.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.180]   In fact, this compassion is what drives God
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.780]   to do all the things that he does
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.820]   to bring Israel out of their slavery into their freedom.
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.300]   Compassion will always be the starting point
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.140]   of any Exodus journey.
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.460]   But what's amazing here is that it's actually
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.780]   not God's compassion that starts Exodus.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.580]   It's a woman's compassion that starts Exodus.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.140]   And it's not just any woman,
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.380]   but it's a woman who is a part of the oppressors.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.060]   I want you to see what God is doing here.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.820]   He's taking one of the very oppressors of his own people,
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.980]   and he's using her to have the compassion
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.540]   that will begin an Exodus journey
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.900]   through the saving of Moses' life.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.060]   God takes the heart of the one
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.620]   who should have thrown the child into abandonment,
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.580]   and he changes that heart
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.980]   so that she would have compassion to act differently.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.580]   And the way that that word is written,
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.740]   it's written in such a way
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.620]   that it's actually describing God's power in that decision.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.880]   In other words, her compassion is not just her compassion.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.400]   God is at work in her to make her compassionate
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.700]   so that she will do this act
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.920]   in order to save a Hebrew child.
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.900]   More than I think the two midwives that we saw last week
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.400]   who have incredible courage,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.740]   this woman has even more courage
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.620]   because the back that she's turning,
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.120]   she's turning her back on her own father.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.740]   This is personal to her.
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.220]   But she does it because there is this transformation
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.340]   that happens in her heart by the Spirit of God.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.100]   Even though she doesn't worship God,
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.380]   she doesn't believe in God,
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.860]   she never thinks about God,
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.940]   and God is still at work 'cause God can take anybody
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.380]   and change their hearts for his purposes.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.900]   And some of you need to hear that in this room
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.980]   in your Exodus journey.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.220]   God can take anyone,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.100]   and he can use his Spirit to change their heart
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.040]   so he can sweep them up in his redemptive work
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.280]   that he does in this world.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.320]   It's not just us Christians that get to enjoy that.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.700]   God even uses anyone, anyone, even a non-Christian
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.780]   can be swept up in the power of God.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.260]   Their hearts can be changed,
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.620]   and they can actually maybe even inadvertently
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.580]   begin to work on behalf of God's will.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.980]   That's how powerful our God is.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.100]   That's the victory that he has,
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.060]   that he's willing to stand over a group of people
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.420]   and say, "I will work on every human heart
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.260]   "to bring my purposes in this world."
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.600]   And for some of you in this room,
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.980]   that's a word in season for you
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:02.160]   because you're in a relationship right now
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.540]   where you've been praying for a long time
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.500]   for God to change their heart about something.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   And you think that that heart cannot be changed.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.980]   You think that there's no way that that heart can be changed.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:13.940]   You've kind of given up.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.980]   Some of you in this room, some of you are parents,
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.740]   and you've been praying for the salvation of your children.
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.740]   And you look at your children and what they do
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.660]   and how they act, and you think to yourself,
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.300]   they're about as far away from Jesus
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.820]   as I could ever imagine.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.220]   I don't think they're ever gonna come to faith.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.140]   Some of you have been praying for your adult children,
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.300]   and you're desperate to see them come to Jesus,
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.980]   and you think they're never gonna change.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.780]   Some of you are in a difficult relationship and work,
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.300]   and you're like, God, if you only stepped in
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.940]   and changed this person's perspective,
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.460]   then my life would be a lot easier,
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.900]   but you don't think it's gonna happen.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.300]   And here's a story where the daughter of the oppressor
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.220]   has her heart changed by God so she can set people free.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.300]   And that should encourage you never to stop praying.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.180]   Never give up in prayer.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.380]   If you've been praying for your child to come to Jesus,
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.900]   never give up on your prayer.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.500]   He's at work.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.420]   If you're praying for God to liberate you
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.900]   from some situation that you're in
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.020]   where you're feeling oppressed,
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.940]   and you think that person's heart can never change
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.740]   to have a softer heart towards you, don't give up praying.
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:13.420]   God can step in, and God can do the very things
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.700]   that we would never think he could do.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:21.940]   And what's really beautiful and profound about this
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.500]   is that as God's at work in this woman's heart to do this,
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:31.580]   his heart is still so much for the mother.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.780]   I wanna show you what happens next.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.220]   Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.980]   "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.740]   "to nurse this baby for you?"
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.460]   "Yes, go," she answered.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.860]   And the girl went and got the baby's mother.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.060]   Pharaoh's daughter said to her,
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.780]   "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you."
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.900]   So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.860]   I want you to follow what's happening here
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.980]   'cause we serve a God who's able to turn things around.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.780]   We serve a God that when you release, he will give back.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.460]   We serve a God that when we step out in faith,
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:03.980]   he will do things that we never thought he would do
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.660]   to come around and turn things around.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:09.620]   Here's a story of a mother who releases on an ark,
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.580]   believing that God can save her child,
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.420]   but was probably thinking,
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.180]   "I'm never gonna see him before again.
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.460]   "I'm never gonna see him again.
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.460]   "I'm releasing him.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.540]   "I'm giving him to the Lord.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.660]   "I don't know what's gonna happen."
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.940]   Here's a God who takes the oppressor
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.780]   and he breaks the oppressor's heart by his spirit,
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.500]   who takes this child out of the waters of death,
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.540]   decides to then have this child.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.020]   Oh, and then it just so happens that Miriam,
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:34.020]   the child's sister, is standing nearby.
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.100]   She shows up and goes,
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.420]   "Oh, I know someone who could actually look
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.420]   "after that child for you and nurse that child."
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.220]   The child goes into that person's hand.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.540]   That person takes it back to the mother,
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.820]   and the mother gets to raise the child,
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.340]   and get this, she's paid for it.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.420]   (congregation laughing)
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.300]   I mean, if you wanna know a story of redemption,
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   a story of God's heart for his people,
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.340]   he's saying, "This is how Exodus begins.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.420]   "I changed the heart of the oppressor,
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.620]   "and I have not abandoned Moses,
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.380]   "but I also have not abandoned this mother,
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.540]   "and she's gonna raise this child,
[00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.140]   "and she's gonna be the only Hebrew mother
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.540]   "in the whole of Egypt who is allowed to raise a boy
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.860]   "under the very obedience of Pharaoh himself."
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.140]   Pharaoh's household provides her the protection
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.740]   to be able to raise the child
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.020]   that should have been abandoned in the waters.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.100]   I said in the film that so often,
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:34.900]   redemption and freedom is birthed out of the very places
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.100]   where the worst expressions of oppression have occurred.
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.220]   You need to know on your journey of Exodus,
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.920]   the places that you think are the most broken in you,
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.520]   the places where you think God is the furthest away,
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.220]   the places where you think you're never going
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.580]   to get anything out of that,
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.340]   those are the very places God loves to birth his hope.
[00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.220]   Those are the very places that God loves to turn around.
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.460]   Those are the moments where God steps in,
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.420]   and goes, "You thought that this would never happen.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:03.940]   "Watch what I can do, 'cause I'm the God of the Exodus."
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.460]   I love this.
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.300]   There are some of us in this room
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.060]   where what you think is absolutely incomprehensible
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.560]   could never happen, God already sees as having had happened.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.740]   For when this mother gives this child in the ark,
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.460]   and releases this child in the basket, God already knew.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.660]   You could almost see him standing over her going like,
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.140]   (laughing)
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.860]   if only you knew what was about to happen, right?
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:32.460]   You can almost sense God's excitement for her,
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.340]   that in her obedience of her letting go in faith,
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.540]   God is like, "I'm gonna reward that faith.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.620]   "I'm gonna reward that faith
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.760]   "by giving this child back to you.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.060]   "I'm not only giving this child back to you,
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.560]   "I'm gonna protect you so you can raise him,
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.040]   "and not only that, I'm gonna pay you
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.100]   "so that you can then provide for your wider family.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.620]   "This is all happening because I reward faith."
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.100]   And you need to understand that that's what God does.
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.940]   God rewards faith.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.420]   And sometimes we worry about saying that in church,
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:58.480]   because we're so afraid of the prosperity gospel.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.740]   But we also have to realize that
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.700]   in being afraid of the prosperity gospel,
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.860]   we gotta be careful that we don't become
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.260]   the impoverished gospel.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:10.380]   And there's a center line here, where God does reward faith.
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.380]   And it's gonna require faith for you
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.300]   to step out in your own exodus.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.420]   It's gonna require courage and faith for you
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.260]   to let go of even the very things that are blessing you
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.940]   to ensure that they don't become idols.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.060]   It's gonna take faith in you
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.580]   to know that God is at work and that it is good,
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.260]   even though it might seem like it's overwhelmingly bad.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.260]   Faith is an important part of your exodus.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.820]   And here's this Pharaoh's daughter
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:44.200]   who does an incredible thing,
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.160]   brave thing to stand against her father
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.560]   so that the child would be set free.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   Notice verse 10.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.980]   When the child grew older,
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.780]   she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:02.780]   She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.140]   See, Pharaoh's daughter didn't just draw Moses
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.020]   out of the water and give it back to the Hebrew family
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.320]   and then forget about him.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.620]   She drew him out of the water
[00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.340]   because she wanted to take him into her family.
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:16.180]   And as I said in the film,
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.860]   this is the Bible's first story of adoption.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.220]   And adoption from this point forward
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.620]   is gonna become the main metaphor
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.300]   that the Bible uses to speak about the redemption work
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.740]   of God.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.580]   In the New Testament,
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.300]   we know that the early church would use the adoption metaphor
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.620]   to help speak about Gentiles.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.700]   And if you're in this room right now watching online
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.900]   and you're not of Jewish descent, then you are a Gentile.
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.140]   And you're a part of the incredible story of God
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.380]   because you have now been swept up in his adoptive power,
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.580]   that he has adopted you out of the waters of death
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.400]   and brought you now into his family.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.620]   You are his child now.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.340]   And that whole metaphor, that whole journey starts here.
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.420]   And you see, adoption is about the reversing
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.500]   of the curse of abandonment.
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.380]   Notice this, guys.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.180]   Adoption is about the reversing of the curse of abandonment.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.460]   Adoption is the very opposite
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.820]   of what a Pharaoh is trying to do here.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.700]   He's trying to abandon these children,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.260]   but his own daughter moved in compassion
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.460]   'cause the Spirit is at work in her heart,
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.660]   is willing to draw this child out of the waters
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.500]   and bring it into her own family.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.020]   And as she's doing that,
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.060]   she's standing against the very abandonment
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.500]   that her father has decreed,
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.820]   and she's saying, "No, this is family."
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.340]   In drawing Moses out of the water,
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:32.020]   what she's doing is drawing the boundaries of her family
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.820]   much broader than the confines of bloodline.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.440]   It's hard to describe to you the travesty
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.420]   of what it would have meant for Pharaoh and his family
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.540]   that now a Hebrew child was part of the family.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.980]   That was deeply, deeply embarrassing for them.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.080]   And this daughter was the one who was willing to say,
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.080]   "We're gonna draw our family broader than just bloodline."
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.960]   Notice what she calls him.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.380]   She calls him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of water."
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.300]   This is really interesting.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.340]   I wanna just close on this.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.780]   There's no way that Pharaoh's daughter
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.500]   spoke Hebrew or understood Hebrew.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.580]   Just would not have been a thing.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.220]   So she doesn't call him Moses in the Hebrew sense.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.340]   She calls him Moses in the Egyptian sense.
[00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:24.540]   Interestingly, Moses was actually a compound word
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:27.460]   that was used in Egypt at that time.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.060]   The word itself actually is this word here.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.260]   It's M-S/M-S-I.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.060]   I know that doesn't really kind of sound like anything,
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:38.580]   but it means to give birth, to have a child or a son.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.860]   And it's used, so these two people here
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:44.300]   are pharaohs of this time, Thutmose and Rameses.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.660]   I want you to notice the Moses on Thutmose
[00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.220]   and the Meses on Rameses.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.020]   That's both this compound word that means Moses.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.660]   So Thutmose means Thoth is born.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.940]   Rameses means Ra is born.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.700]   So it's always this person is born.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   So something Moses, does that make sense?
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.380]   It's a little bit like in our modern day,
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.420]   we might say Johnson as the surname, son of John.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.980]   So this is something Moses means the son of,
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.180]   the child of that person.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.100]   Here's the powerful thing.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.260]   She decides to just call him Moses
[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.500]   because she doesn't know who he's the son of.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.220]   This child's been abandoned.
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.620]   She doesn't know that this mother that's been nursing him
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.980]   has been the real mother.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.420]   She doesn't know where he comes from.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.340]   She doesn't know the prefix to his name,
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.380]   but she's willing to call him Moses
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.060]   'cause what she's saying, I think, to her father
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.260]   and to everybody around her is that even though
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.260]   we don't know who this is a child of, he is a child.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.500]   He is here.
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.100]   He has been born.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.420]   He has value, intrinsic worth.
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.580]   I am not abandoning this one.
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.100]   I'm even gonna take this one into my own family
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:53.780]   for he is a Moses, a child of, a son of somebody.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.020]   And I value that.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.900]   And so he is now mine.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.300]   Powerful, right?
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.820]   That's right against her dad.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:05.860]   And that's her saying, this one has value.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.420]   But Moses, as he's writing this,
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:11.900]   he uses the Hebrew form of his name, of course.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.980]   And let me tell you what Moses means in Hebrew.
[00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:16.980]   Moses is Moshe in Hebrew, M-S-H-H,
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.900]   which is there on the right-hand side.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.620]   You can see the Hebrew actually of it.
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.500]   It literally means to be drawn out.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.580]   Now, there's two ways you can use the word Moses,
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.980]   active, the one who draws out,
[00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.940]   or passive, the one who was drawn out.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.220]   And Moses, as he's writing this,
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.020]   he decides to use the active verb of his name,
[00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:38.580]   which means the one who draws out.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:39.980]   Because what he's trying to communicate
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:43.700]   is not just the heart that Pharaoh's daughter had to say,
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.060]   even though I don't know the prefix,
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.700]   I'm gonna say that this is a son of,
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.020]   he's also then saying, I am the one who will draw out.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:54.060]   God called me to be the drawer-outerer.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.020]   I'm not just being drawn out.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.060]   So it's not the passive context, the one who was drawn out.
[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.580]   He says, I am the active word.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.380]   I am the one who draws out.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.220]   And he's saying that this is what God's about to do
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.060]   in the rest of the story.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:08.900]   He's gonna use me to go back to Israel
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.380]   to actually take them from their slavery and sin
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.980]   and draw them into the promised land.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.020]   I am the one who will draw out.
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.420]   And God stands over you and says,
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:20.700]   I'm the one who draws out.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.060]   I'm the one who draws you out.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.300]   And I draw you out so I can draw you in.
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.140]   I have drawn you out of the waters of death
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.780]   and I have brought you into new life.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.180]   And this idea of drawing out and drawing in
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.060]   is what all of the Exodus story
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.580]   really essentially is about.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.060]   And in about two weeks time, I'm gonna show you
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.260]   the power of what it is to be drawn out, to be drawn in.
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.860]   But right here, right now, here's what God wants you to know.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.220]   You yourself are Moses.
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:52.220]   You are a Moses in the Egyptian and Hebrew sense.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:56.340]   In the Egyptian sense, you are not abandoned.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.300]   You are not an orphan.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.500]   God looks down on you and says, this is my child.
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.980]   This one has been created and it is good.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.540]   Some of you in this room, you don't think you're good.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.140]   And again, I'm not talking about some moral statement.
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.940]   I'm talking about the purposes and promises of God
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.260]   to create you and bring you in this world.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.800]   There is no one like you.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.580]   And God loves you so much that he sees you just as you are
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.780]   and you are good and you are valued to him.
[00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.740]   You are his son and his daughter.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:29.320]   You are his child and he welcomes you into his family.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:33.020]   And you are a Moses in the Hebrew sense.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.220]   You, if you're a Christian in this room watching online,
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.100]   you have been drawn out of the waters of death
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.580]   and you have been brought into new life
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.280]   through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.740]   He's forgiven your sin, removed it from you.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.300]   You've gone on your ark through your relationship with God
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.740]   and you are now free to be who he has called you to be.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:51.940]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:55.180]   But you are also a Moses in the sense
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.660]   that your primary will, the primary will of God
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:02.420]   over your life is that now having experienced salvation
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.100]   and life yourself, having been taken from the waters
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.760]   of death and brought into life itself,
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.740]   you now are one who can Moses with others.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.160]   You now are one who can stand before the people
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.100]   in your workplace, the people in your family,
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.020]   the children that you have, whatever it might be,
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.500]   and say, "These things will not be abandoned either
[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.220]   "and this will be something that I can partner with God
[00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.140]   "to bring out of darkness into light."
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.000]   That's Exodus.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.460]   That's the journey.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.180]   That's what you're invited into.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.780]   You are not abandoned.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:35.820]   You are a child of God.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.260]   He sees you and loves you.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.860]   And as you trust him and as you're willing
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.820]   to release control of your life to him,
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.680]   you will see a freedom and an Exodus in your life
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.220]   like you've never seen before.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.860]   Can I pray for you?
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.060]   Would you stand with me?
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:57.880]   And as we stand together,
[00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.220]   I wonder whether you close your eyes, open your hands.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.100]   I wanna minister now to you guys in the spirit
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.800]   by reading a Psalm over you.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.960]   Thousands of years later,
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.140]   or maybe about a thousand years later,
[00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:16.100]   David writes a Psalm, Psalm 18,
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.900]   and he pulls up this imagery of Moses
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.340]   being drawn out of the water.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.380]   I wanna pray this over you.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.480]   It says this, "The Lord has reached down from on high
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.860]   "and taken hold of me.
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.840]   "He drew me out of the mighty waters.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.980]   "He has delivered me from a powerful enemy,
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.200]   "from my foes who were too strong for me.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.420]   "For they confronted me in the day of my disaster,
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.780]   "but the Lord was my support.
[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.200]   "For he brought me into a spacious place.
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.360]   "He has delivered me because he's delighted in me."
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.560]   Father, I thank you that you delight
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.660]   in every person here and online right now.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.360]   And Father, you are at work with deliverance, Lord.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.960]   And Father, I pray that you would give us
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.580]   the courage of this mother to let go,
[00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:11.240]   the courage of this mother to release to you
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.100]   everything in our lives,
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.340]   trusting that you are a good father.
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:21.760]   And Father, when we carry an orphan spirit in us,
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.120]   it's such a thing that breaks us deeply.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.680]   And it causes us to be abandoned from the people around us.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:31.520]   I wonder whether you just take a moment to recognize
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.180]   whether that's something that's a reality for you.
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.440]   Do you feel abandoned?
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   Abandoned by God, abandoned by your family,
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.080]   abandoned from people around you?
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.680]   Do you feel looked over?
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.000]   Do you feel like nobody values you?
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.500]   Do you feel cast aside?
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.120]   Do you feel like no one sees in you
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.640]   what you see in yourself?
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:59.340]   Do you feel like you don't have the worth
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.560]   that others might have?
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:05.440]   That's the work of abandonment in you,
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.540]   to try to define you in any other way
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.980]   than how God truly sees you.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.100]   Father, we come against the spirit of abandonment
[00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.420]   over these people in the name of Jesus.
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.380]   And Father, I wanna release
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.180]   the spirit of adoption right now.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.820]   I pray, Lord, that every person in this room
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:23.220]   would know that they are valued, created, a Moses.
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.020]   That they are loved by you, a child of yours.
[00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.580]   That they would know that they are a Moses,
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:31.800]   drawn out of the dark waters into salvation and life.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.980]   And as we're just praying with our eyes closed,
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.220]   I wanna just say this.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:39.920]   There's some of you in this room and your parents.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.900]   And I felt this strongly in the first service,
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   and I feel it strongly now.
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:47.700]   Your parents over children.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.900]   And you're holding on too tightly to your children.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.580]   And your children are a gift from God,
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.900]   a blessing from God.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.820]   But you're holding onto them too tightly.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.580]   And you're afraid.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.260]   You're afraid that they might feel abandoned.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:09.900]   But you're holding on so tightly, you're crushing them.
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.900]   And the word of the Lord to you today,
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.540]   he's saying, "Do you trust me with your kids?
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:19.220]   "Do you trust me with your children?"
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.540]   Because if you do, release them to me.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.580]   That doesn't mean you give up
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:28.220]   all your responsibilities, of course.
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.340]   But it means that you let go of control.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:34.220]   That you release that control over your children
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:35.060]   to the Lord.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:39.620]   And some of you here believe that.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:44.300]   Believe that those children can't change.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.460]   And you're so frustrated.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.740]   And out of that frustration, you've been controlling.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.100]   God's saying, "Watch what I will do through my spirit in the heart of your child."
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:55:02.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
