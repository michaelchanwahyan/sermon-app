1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 All right, let's put our hands together for the family and for everybody.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Wonderful. So good to see you guys. What a beautiful thing. You can have a seat.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 You can have a seat. Thanks, everyone. And, you know, if you were here last week,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 you'll remember that we had Vision Sunday Part 2 last week as a church.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And we are so grateful for just the outpouring of love and support and just excitement in the house last week

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 when we unveiled the idea that we're going to be planning a church in Yuen Long

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 by at least Easter of 2023, quite possibly earlier. We'll see how we go.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And you guys gave tremendously, generously, so much so that we're still counting and processing what has come in.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 That's a good sign. And we are very grateful that you stood with us.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We're going to be announcing next week what we raised. There are still some offerings that are coming in.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 It's not too late to give if you'd still like to give towards our Vision Sunday and our Yuen Long church plan.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Everything that's given last week and to Vision Sunday will go towards that church plan.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And so you still have time to do that if you would like.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 But we'll let you know next week the result of all of that giving and all of the standing with us.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And I'm excited to do that with you guys. So thanks so much.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 If you weren't here last week, I really want to encourage you.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 If this is your home church, jump online, go back to the broadcast from last week

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 and listen to a little bit of our heart for why we want to plan Yuen Long and what that's all going to be about.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We have our offering, our normal tithes and offerings every week.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 And we have a chance to do that right now, whether you're online or in the room right behind me here or on the screen.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 If you're watching online or all the ways in which you can digitally give in this time.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And I want to thank you guys for continuing to stand with us as a church.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Let me pray for us as we come to our time of giving.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Father, we are just really honored to be a church in which generosity is a culture here.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And Father, we are thankful for the generosity of the men and women and families of this church.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And Father, we know that tithing is a principle that should flow through the kingdom.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And so as these faithful people tithe to this community of faith, Lord, you make the vine a tithing community as well outwards.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And we are so grateful for the NGOs and the missionaries and the various partners, both here in Hong Kong and around the world,

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 that we get the joy of tithing to and partnering with.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And Lord, we pray that that ongoing work would continue amongst us.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And the flow of your resources in your kingdom would always be open handed and led by your spirit.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And we thank you for this in Jesus name. Everyone says Amen.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Well, it's exciting. We're continuing a series that we put on pause for about four weeks.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 If you remember right before the end of Church Everywhere, we were in a series called The Unfinished Story, which is based on the book of Acts.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And this is one of the important series of this year, because one of the things that God has said to us right at the beginning of this year is that 2022 was going to be about discipleship and about evangelism.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And the story of Acts and what the early church goes through in Acts is a story of God by his spirit,

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 establishing discipleship and evangelism as a heartbeat for what the church community should be all about.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And so we've spent about five weeks already in that book.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 We had then about a four week pause as we reopened and addressed some of the spiritual ways in which we should reopen.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And today we're going to kick off that series again over the next about six or seven weeks as we go through the book of Acts

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 and look at how that can shape us as a church in this season.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And I couldn't be more excited than we have Pastor Promise with us today.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Let's give a round of applause as Promise comes.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Love it. Why don't you stretch out your hands? Let's pray for Promise.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Father, we're so grateful for this man, for Kayla, for Elias, for this family amongst us.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And we're thankful that when it comes to preaching a word, Lord, we do our part and you come and anoint and move.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And Lord, I thank you that Promise has done his part. He's prepared, he's researched, he's read, he's prayed.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And Lord, as he now speaks, we pray that your spirit would open our hearts, Lord, that you would prepare us for this word.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 You would make us hungry, Lord, for the gift and the joy of sharing the gospel with those around us.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 We just thank you for that in Jesus name. Everyone says, Amen.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Well, good morning, everyone. How are you guys doing?

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I would like to talk to us today about something pretty important.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 The thing I want to talk to us about today is something I've noticed over the past eight and a half years of being here in Hong Kong.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's something that a lot of us have in common, either something that you've experienced in the past.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 It's the thing that you are probably living in, living through right now or something you might be living in within the future.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 The super important thing that I want to talk to us about today is IKEA.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So many of us use IKEA, whether it's their couches or their floating shelves or just their little benches or whatever units we have.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It seems like everyone in Hong Kong at some point has either owned IKEA, has something of IKEA in their house or has moved past that.

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I actually dislike IKEA very much. Let me tell you why.

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It's not that their shelves aren't quality. They're fine. It's not that their beds aren't good.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 The frames work fine, but it's the fact that you have to assemble their products.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And honestly, assembling their products takes all the strength of the Holy Spirit working in you.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 To build a tiny bookshelf for our living room took me about three and a half days. I exaggerate.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So here's the tip, something I want to give you for free, not a part of my sermon.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 If you go to IKEA and you decide to purchase something, be smart and ask them to assemble it for you.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 You'll save yourself a lot of gray hairs in the future.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 But if you happen to be like myself and you feel like you can take on the challenge,

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 just some encouragement of what you should do when you're trying to assemble an IKEA set.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Step one, read the directions.

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 Every IKEA product comes with this little booklet, and the booklet has step one, step two, step three, select step 15.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It has these little pictures on it that are kind of unhelpful, but at least they're there,

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 showing you what it should look like, arrows pointing in directions,

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 and these little tools that don't work in the real world, but only work for IKEA products.

74
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 The encouragement I give you is to follow the instructions.

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And what will happen is that you'll start to build, and if you're anything like me,

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 you'll make the mistake of thinking that after step three, "Ah, this seems simple enough.

77
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I could predict how this will go. I can put the pieces together."

78
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And you'll disregard the manual, and you'll start building, and you'll go crazy,

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 because you actually can't do it.

80
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 You have to follow IKEA's process.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 If you're going to build an IKEA table, if you're going to have an IKEA product,

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 you have to follow their process.

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And so it means going step by step through each of the instructions and following what it says.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And at a certain point in that building process, you're going to have an "aha" moment.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 You're going to have an "oh, that's where this is going."

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Your adult Lego set will actually turn into a functioning wardrobe or a functioning table,

87
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 and it'll all come together.

88
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The fog will lift, and it'll become clear that this is what you're actually building.

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 But if you think about it in that process, you realize you couldn't have gotten to that end point

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 without following those specific steps.

91
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 If you skip a step, it'll drive you crazy, because you can never get to that "aha" moment

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 without following those steps.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 If you're going to build an IKEA product, you have to follow the IKEA process.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And I found that the Holy Spirit works very similarly.

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 If we're going to follow God, if we're going to live lives that are led by the Spirit,

96
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 we too have to follow the Holy Spirit's process.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And we're talking about the Holy Spirit because we're in a series,

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 another series, as Pastor Andrew just mentioned, called "The Unfinished Story,"

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 a series examining the book of Acts, looking at how the Spirit of God birthed the church

100
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 and allowed it to grow and be sustained and become completely transformative

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 in an environment that was hostile, full of many challenges.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 See, the promise from Jesus was that the church would go through Jerusalem and then to Judea,

103
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 and to Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

104
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 As we look through the book of Acts, it's actually giving us how that actually took place,

105
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 the promise of Jesus being fulfilled.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 The gospel would reach far beyond ethnic borders and make it to all people.

107
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And you and I are living proof of that today.

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 The book of Acts, in essence, is about this spread of the good news.

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 It's about evangelism.

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And that's fortunate because we, as Pastor Andrew just mentioned,

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 currently have discerned that God is calling us to focus on these two things,

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 discipleship and evangelism.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Now, evangelism is not a new idea just for the season.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 It's not something that we conjured up out of creativity.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 It's actually something that is drenched in Scripture.

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 It's rooted in Matthew chapter 28, where Jesus tells his followers to go and make disciples of all people,

117
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 teaching them to observe what he has taught them.

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's that concept that we build our understanding of evangelism from.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And for that reason, evangelism is a method of expanding the good news of who Jesus was,

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 who he is, and what he's done.

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Let me put it this way. Evangelism is this.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It's the partnership of God's people with God's Spirit

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 to bring those who were far off close to Christ.

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And that's kind of a bit of a big deal.

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It's a crucial pillar in the Christian faith.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Yet there's something about evangelism that if we're fully honest,

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 we either ignore it or we feel uncomfortable to do it.

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Something about it creates this tension.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 The idea of discipleship, we can engage in that.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 We can go to small group. We can talk to our friends and have those conversations and be in community.

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 But the idea of telling someone about Jesus, it kind of creeps our skin a little bit.

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And so I talked to some of our congregation members,

133
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 some of you, one of you actually here is in this room today,

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 about why is it that you feel that hesitation about evangelism?

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Like what is it about evangelism that just feels unnatural or just,

136
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 "I can't do it. I don't have the confidence to do it or the courage to do it."

137
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And I wanted to share five of the responses that I got.

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 And my hope is that you potentially see that this is something that a lot of us struggle with.

139
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 So the first thing is this.

140
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 The hesitation to evangelize is because of personal rejection.

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 The fear of being personally rejected.

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 The second thing was this.

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Someone said, "I don't think my story has the ability to inspire people to become Christians."

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 It's a pretty legitimate answer.

145
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 The third one said this, "I don't have the ability to articulate it very well."

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Another person said, "I feel awkward talking to someone I don't know about Jesus."

147
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Let me confess, I feel awkward too about it.

148
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And lastly, someone said, "I don't have the tools that I need to be able to do that well."

149
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And I think as we break these five thoughts down,

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 we can find some pretty clear concepts,

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 two main veins of understanding what is causing us to be hesitant in engaging in evangelism.

152
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 The first thing is this.

153
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 We hesitate to evangelize because we have this belief that we lack what we need.

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We hear the word evangelism and we tell ourselves we could never do it.

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 It's not for me because we don't think we have what we need.

156
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And I get it. Evangelism is a tall order. It's a big deal.

157
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's this aspect of transformation.

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And transformation takes place when extraordinary people have these conversations.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And you and I are not extraordinary people. We're pretty average people.

160
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Some would say small potato in a wet market.

161
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And so for that reason, evangelism is for the people who are really good at it.

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 You think of like maybe Jackie Pollinger. She should be evangelizing, not me.

163
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Or maybe Pastor John Snellgrove. He should be evangelizing, but not me.

164
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 It's not for me because we feel ordinary.

165
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And that fear and that perspective is one of the reasons we hesitate.

166
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 We don't think we have what we need. We don't think we are what we need.

167
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Our second category is this.

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 We hesitate to evangelize because we don't recognize the weight and the power of what's been given to us.

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Now what has been given to us? It's the Holy Spirit.

170
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Actually in that verse in Matthew 28, after saying go and make disciples and evangelize people,

171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 he says, "And I will be with you." A promise that he will be with us.

172
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 So maybe you're right. Maybe evangelism is too heavy to do on our own.

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Maybe it is too much work to plan and prepare and to know all the right answers.

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And maybe the people in your space aren't interested.

175
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Maybe they already have their own religion. Maybe they've told you, "I don't do religion. Don't talk to me about it."

176
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 But I believe this only goes to prove the point that, one, we have what we need,

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 but we so desperately need the Holy Spirit in evangelism.

178
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 It's not something that just you and I can do, but it's our partnership with him.

179
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 He guides and provides, and we follow his leading in that space.

180
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 See, evangelism is a work of the Holy Spirit, and we get to partner with him in what he's doing.

181
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 We have the right tools. We actually have what it takes.

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 All of us have the ability to engage in evangelism and watch God transform lives.

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 You don't have to be someone special. You just have to be you.

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And I think this is a tension worth wrestling with, because evangelism isn't a suggestion.

185
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 It's not—there's no asterisk next to it.

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Like, it's a part of what we're called to do. There are no exemption forms for that.

187
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Like, as a Christian, it's a part of who you are. It's in your DNA.

188
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 The way God has created you is to be able to share and pull people into a relationship with him,

189
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 ushering people into that intimate knowledge of Jesus.

190
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Because there's a way God has designed evangelism for all of us to be able to take part in it and do it well.

191
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 The Scriptures give remarkable examples, and today, as we continue our study in Acts,

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 we'll look at Acts chapter 8, starting at verse 21,

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 and we'll see in this text one incredible example of how the Spirit can work.

194
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Are you guys with me? All right, let's turn to our Bibles.

195
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 If you have your Bible, you can open it. If not, it'll be here on the screen.

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Acts chapter 8, starting at verse 21, says this,

197
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 "But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, 'Rise and go towards the south,

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road.'"

199
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Keep that in mind. That'll be important later on.

200
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 "And so he rose and he went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch,

201
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 a minister of the Candace, queen of Ethiopians, in charge of all her treasure,

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 had come to Jerusalem to worship and was returning.

203
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And the Spirit said to Philip, 'Go up and join the chariot.'

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 So Philip ran to him and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah and asked,

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 'Do you understand what you are reading?'

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And he, the eunuch, said, 'How can I, unless someone guides me?'

208
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Now the passage he was reading was this,

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 "As a sheep led to the slaughter or a lamb before its shearer is dumbed,

211
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 so he opens not his mouth. And in his humiliation, justice was denied to him.

212
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken up from the earth.

213
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And the eunuch said to Philip, 'About whom does this prophet say this?

214
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Is it about himself or is it about someone else?'

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Then Philip opened his mouth and beginning with the scripture,

216
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 he told him the good news of Jesus.

217
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And as they went along the road, they came to some water.

218
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And the eunuch said, 'See, here is water. What is to prevent my being baptized?'

219
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And he commanded the chariot to stop.

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip,

222
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing."

223
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 This is a pretty long but intense story.

224
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 It has a lot of things happening in it.

225
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 I think as we actually look at this story,

226
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 it exemplifies one of the ways God, through his Spirit, will work in evangelism.

227
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 We see here that it's a combination of the Holy Spirit's work,

228
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 the Christ follower, and a relentless obedience

229
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 that ends up radically transforming the life of this random Ethiopian man on his way back home.

230
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 This isn't the only way that evangelism can take place,

231
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 but it is one of the ways that the Spirit tends to work and partner with us ordinary people

232
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 into extraordinary life-changing moments.

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 This story is oftentimes referred to as Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch.

234
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It's kind of interesting because when we look at this story,

235
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 the first big pillar of evangelism that we see is that this story has very little to do with Philip.

236
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 We see that evangelism is this. It's a work of the Spirit.

237
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 If we were to examine the passage, looking back at verse 26,

238
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Philip is simply directed to go.

239
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Philip doesn't come up with the idea on his own.

240
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 No, he is following instructions.

241
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 The Spirit instigates, it leads, and it directs.

242
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 We can see the Spirit giving directions and Philip responding to those directions.

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Philip is told to go, and he does just that.

244
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Now, I think of you and me, and maybe more me than you,

245
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 if I was in this space, what I would do?

246
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 If the Spirit told me to go to some random location on a desert road, I'd have some questions.

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 First of all, I want to know how long it's going to take.

248
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 What are we doing?

249
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Who's going to be there?

250
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 I'd have so many. Is it a sleepover? Do I need to bring my stuff?

251
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 There's so many questions that would be running through my mind.

252
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 But if we look at this story, we notice two key things here.

253
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Philip isn't given any of that.

254
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 He's not given the game plan.

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 The next five steps aren't laid out in front of him.

256
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's just one, it's just go.

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And the second thing is this.

258
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Even though he's not given any of that, it doesn't hinder his obedience.

259
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 That's the kind of faith, that's the kind of trust.

260
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 There is this kind of trusting, the kind of faith that follows God no matter where he's going to lead.

261
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 We look again at verse 29, just pushing this point a little further.

262
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 The Spirit told Philip, "Go to the chariot and stay next to it."

263
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 What we have there is more instructions and more obedience.

264
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And actually, it's not as simple as you would think.

265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 In this case, he's in the desert road.

266
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 He's already followed the Spirit and he ends up in this location.

267
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 The Spirit says, "There's a chariot, go to the chariot."

268
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 It's not as simple as go.

269
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Just a little bit of extra knowledge for you.

270
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Chariots have wheels and humans have legs.

271
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 One is faster than the other.

272
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Actually, the text says, "So Philip ran to him."

273
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Philip chased a chariot, not knowing what for, in the middle of the desert.

274
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 By most of our logic, that would seem extremely silly.

275
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I would say by a lot of the times, that would seem like something we wouldn't want to engage in

276
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 without understanding what it is that God is calling us to do.

277
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 But there is this kind of faith that follows no matter where it leads.

278
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And in that, Philip chases behind this chariot.

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 We don't know for how long. It could have been three kilometers.

280
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 It could have been for a couple seconds.

281
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 But he chases after it.

282
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And in his chasing, he overhears that someone is reading something that's familiar to him.

283
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He overhears the passage from the prophet Isaiah being read.

284
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And that, "Oh, okay. Aha, this is what is happening," moment hits him.

285
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 The fog lifts and it becomes clear that the Spirit had actually set Philip up for the win.

286
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 It's clear for what purpose now that Philip had been brought to this location.

287
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And he realizes as he engages in conversation with the Seseopian eunuch

288
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 and ends up coming up to the top of the chariot and sharing Jesus with him.

289
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And actually, he could have never had that opportunity.

290
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 He could have never been able to utilize that time in that way

291
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 had he not been obedient following steps one and step two.

292
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 See, the Spirit had already been setting up the scene for Philip.

293
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 The Spirit was working and preparing long before Philip even got into that situation.

294
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I mean, think about how perfect the timing would have to be.

295
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 The day, the time, the running pace, the reading pace,

296
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 all of those things would have to just line up for this perfect moment.

297
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 I mean, what are the chances he's reading a passage that Philip knows very well?

298
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Like, that's just crazy talk.

299
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 But somehow, all those things, all those miraculous big things

300
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 that could have never been done by Philip are being done.

301
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And he's being led into a place where he can do certain things.

302
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Some theologians would say this,

303
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 "There proves to be a great deal of groundwork already accomplished in the eunuch's life

304
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 so that he was ready to receive the message Philip would disclose to him from the Scriptures."

305
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 This is all by design.

306
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 See, God is working and moving and setting scenes and preparing situations

307
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 for us all to step into.

308
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 It wasn't random. It wasn't accidental. It wasn't by chance.

309
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 See, God is doing, listen to this statement,

310
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 and I'll say it twice 'cause it's a little tricky.

311
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 God is doing what we can't do so that we can do what we can do.

312
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 One more time.

313
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 God is doing the very things, the arranging the timing

314
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 and getting the chariot to go at this pace

315
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 and getting the location to work,

316
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 all the things that were outside of his control.

317
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 God is doing those things before Philip so that Philip can just do what he can do.

318
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 Can you do what you can do?

319
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Because if you can, then you can partner with what God is calling us into.

320
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 The Spirit was there before Philip.

321
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 He would be there with Philip in his evangelistic effort,

322
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 and the Spirit would remain long after Philip had left.

323
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Looking into this story, I actually find it very interesting as well.

324
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I told you, take note of the location they were in.

325
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 As Luke writes, they were in a desert road.

326
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 So going from Jerusalem to Gaza on a desert road.

327
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 There's a detail in here that doesn't really fit the normal characteristics of a desert road.

328
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 A pool.

329
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 When you think of deserts, I would hope that many of you don't think of water being very common.

330
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Somehow, as they're going on this extremely dry desert road in the middle of the desert,

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 somehow it lines up that right as he understands who Jesus is

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 and that revelation takes place for him,

333
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 that he's like, "Oh, look, there happens to be water right there."

334
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Philip could have never orchestrated that.

335
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Another example of how the Spirit is working, preparing, leading, and guiding, and directing them.

336
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And it's not just something that happens to Philip.

337
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 It's something that will happen to us as we too engage in evangelism.

338
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 We don't have to do all these big things.

339
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 We just have to do the one thing.

340
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 The Spirit will never lose control of our evangelistic situation.

341
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 He shows us that.

342
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Everything that Philip needed was pretty much served up on a silver platter.

343
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 He had to run.

344
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I don't like running, so it would have been hard for me, but he had to run.

345
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 But everything was there.

346
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 He just had to be willing to be obedient.

347
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And because the Spirit will never lose control of any situation in our evangelistic efforts,

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 it doesn't matter what our resume is.

349
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 It doesn't matter how much training we might have had in the past,

350
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 or how much training we think we need,

351
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 or being able to have a rebuttal about every conversation about faith.

352
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You don't have to know all the answers.

353
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Actually, think about Philip, for instance.

354
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 What's his resume?

355
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Does anyone know who Philip was?

356
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 He's not Peter.

357
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 He's not John.

358
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 He's not Paul.

359
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It's not any of the big names we would think of.

360
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Peter, we know who that guy was.

361
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 If this was a story about him, it would be like, "Okay, maybe I should be like a Peter,

362
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 someone who can preach a sermon and 3,000 people immediately become a part of the church."

363
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 That's not his story.

364
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Philip's background is very little and unknown.

365
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Actually, the one thing that we do know about Philip is this.

366
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 When the disciples were--the church had grown,

367
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 and they were finding ways to go and preach the good news,

368
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and they were still trying to meet the needs of people,

369
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 they had their frontline guys who would go and preach.

370
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And I think in the text it says, "He was left to waiting tables."

371
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 He was an admin.

372
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 He was a normal guy, nothing special.

373
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 And if you feel like that's who you are as well, then that must be good news

374
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 because it doesn't require you to be someone special.

375
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 He was average.

376
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 He was not a Christian Avenger.

377
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 He was a normal dude.

378
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And it's great because in that case,

379
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 we learned that the only credentials that were needed were a love for Jesus

380
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 and a willingness to follow the Spirit's leading.

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 That's really all it takes.

382
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Like, what if God isn't looking for you to be the best at this or the best at that?

383
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 What if he's just looking for those who love him and those who are willing to follow him?

384
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And then what if our concerns when it came to evangelism

385
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 was less about how skilled we were at answering questions

386
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and more about how available we were,

387
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 how willing we were to follow without the whole picture painted for us,

388
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 to love God and to follow him?

389
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 See, this is a massive moment in church history.

390
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 As it seems like it's a random person that Philip is having a conversation with,

391
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 but God is showing us through his Spirit that he will use all of us, any of us.

392
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And maybe you're here today and the thing that holds you back

393
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 is your qualification or you don't have the big name

394
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 or you don't have the seminary degree.

395
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Here's the thing, if we become crippled by that,

396
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 then we end up avoiding and staying out of the very thing,

397
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 counting ourselves out of the very thing that God has actually created you to do.

398
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 The very thing that you're capable of being a part of how God transforms lives.

399
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 It's an exciting way to live.

400
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 Don't count yourself out from that.

401
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 This story shows us that God wants to use you as well.

402
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And because evangelism is a work of the Spirit,

403
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 we aren't ever going to find ourselves evangelizing to someone

404
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 who the Spirit isn't already working on, where the Spirit has,

405
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 you won't be the first one there.

406
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 You can trust that God has already been working in that person's life.

407
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So yes, if we don't see evangelism correctly,

408
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 it'll feel too big, it'll feel impossible,

409
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 it'll feel like it's too much weight to carry.

410
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 But when we see it in the right light, we see that evangelism is collaboration.

411
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 It's a group project.

412
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I used to hate group projects, but this kind of group project

413
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 is the group project where your partner is the teacher.

414
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 That's a good group project.

415
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 That's set up for the win.

416
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Like that's what he's calling us into.

417
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 It's not something we have to fear.

418
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 Setting us up to be able to join in what he's doing.

419
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 He prompts our spirit and we simply follow,

420
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 knowing that the results, knowing that the resources,

421
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 the things that we need, the answers that we think we need,

422
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 that will all be provided by and through him.

423
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 This is how he operates.

424
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 This whole story about Philip, about evangelism,

425
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 there's a third angle that I want us to take a look at.

426
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 There's a third person in this story

427
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 that we haven't talked too much about.

428
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 It's this Ethiopian eunuch.

429
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I think as we look into him, we actually get our minds blown

430
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 about what is actually happening.

431
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 This isn't just a random occurrence on a desert road.

432
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Let's dive into this.

433
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 The first thing we need to know about this guy is that he's Ethiopian.

434
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 He's African, aka he's not Jewish.

435
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 He's not of the same ethnicity.

436
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Up until this point, Christianity or Judaism,

437
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Yahweh God was only for those people.

438
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 He was only been available for the people

439
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 within this ethnic group.

440
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And what the promise of the Great Commission

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 is that it's going beyond just the Jews.

442
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 It's going beyond just Jewish people, just one ethnicity,

443
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 but God would be available to all people.

444
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And actually anyone sitting in this room that is Christian

445
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 and not of Jewish heritage is a living proof of that promise.

446
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 So this Ethiopian is not the target person

447
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 that you would think of to become a Christian.

448
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Jesus said that it would spread from Jerusalem to Judea

449
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 to the ends of the earth.

450
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And this is our actual first example of that happening in scripture.

451
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 This Ethiopian becomes a representation

452
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 of what God is planning to do throughout the entire world.

453
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 It's like this God of Israel has now made himself available to all people.

454
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 See what we saw happen in Acts 2

455
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 was more than just a moment of speaking in tongues.

456
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 It was the outpouring of God's very own spirit.

457
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 It was the bringing of the good news to all people.

458
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 God took away this idea that his presence only lives in a temple

459
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 and instead he put his spirit in people like you and like me.

460
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 So we became the temple, the temple that can go to people.

461
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 It's a changing of the centralization that we might've seen

462
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 in the Tower of Babel story.

463
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 It's actually, it's God spreading it out.

464
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 He's giving himself to all people.

465
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 This changes the way that we see the kingdom of God.

466
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And this story is the first practical expression of that.

467
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 The first non-Jewish person to be encountered with the gospel.

468
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And there's actually a double whammy here. I really love this.

469
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 It's not just about, you know, he's Ethiopian.

470
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 So that's one of the barriers.

471
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 But this poor guy had multiple barriers.

472
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He's Ethiopian and he's also a eunuch.

473
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 He has a physical deformity based off of his position

474
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 being super close and working with the queen of a country.

475
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 So by those two things,

476
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 he would have not been easily permitted into the temple.

477
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 The religious structure of the day,

478
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 the way that they would have operated

479
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 would have not allowed him as an unclean man

480
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 to come into the temple.

481
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 So it didn't matter what he did.

482
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 And he had traveled because he's going to Jerusalem,

483
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 as the story tells us.

484
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 So he's traveled from Ethiopia,

485
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 hundreds of miles across a desert to find God,

486
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 only to be shut down by the institution.

487
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And he's reached for God, not been able to find him

488
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 because of his deformity and because he is not Jewish.

489
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 He could not make it into the inner temple.

490
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 So actually, as we look at this,

491
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 what we see is not just a random Philip

492
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 showing up to a random person in the desert.

493
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 This is someone who had put forth effort,

494
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 who had purchased a scroll,

495
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 who had come to worship Yahweh, had been denied that.

496
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And God didn't miss that.

497
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 No, God saw that this man was unable to reach him.

498
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 And so what God did,

499
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 and what evangelism looks like a lot of times

500
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 is God reaching that man.

501
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 In the desert, on his way out,

502
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 God sends us to reach those who have a hard time reaching him.

503
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 This man is not someone that Philip

504
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 would have naturally thought would be a good candidate

505
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 for the gospel because of those things.

506
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 We think about Philip's position,

507
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 his understanding would have never thought,

508
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 okay, this is the perfect candidate.

509
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Probably would have thought someone else would be that.

510
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And I wonder how often we find ourselves in similar boats.

511
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Like are there people in our lives who maybe for good reason,

512
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 we've deemed unlikely recipients of the gospel.

513
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Maybe they have their own religion already.

514
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 Maybe they've declared that they're atheists

515
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 and they don't care about God.

516
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Maybe they're just very focused on making money,

517
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 don't really want friends or anything.

518
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 But are there people in our lives that we've,

519
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 maybe for good reason,

520
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 thought they're not the right recipients.

521
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Because it seems like it's the people

522
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 that we would naturally count out.

523
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 The people that would naturally think,

524
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 maybe that's not where God's going,

525
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 that he's actually chasing after.

526
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 He is sending us to.

527
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 See God's plan exceeds what we think is possible.

528
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Who we think might be interested,

529
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 who we might've ruled out.

530
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 God is calling all of those people to himself

531
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 because get this, the gospel is for all people.

532
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And so where's the grace?

533
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 What do we take away from this?

534
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 What do we hold on to?

535
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 For me, when I read this passage and I studied it,

536
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 I found great encouragement.

537
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Because I too, if I'm being fully honest,

538
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 am hesitant in evangelism.

539
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 It doesn't come naturally for me.

540
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 I don't have those skill sets,

541
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 but I've learned that I don't have to.

542
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 I don't have to be the best this or that.

543
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 And my prayer is that for you to find that same reality.

544
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 I think what we take away from this is that

545
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 God doesn't need for you to be great for him.

546
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 He just needs you to follow him.

547
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And in that obedience,

548
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 he will make you into someone great.

549
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 He will cause you to do things that you actually realize

550
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 you could have never done on your own.

551
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And that simply is because evangelism is a work of the spirit

552
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 that you and I are invited into partnering into.

553
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 So all who love and follow Christ are qualified.

554
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 That's you, that's me, that's any of us.

555
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 If we will follow, he will lead us.

556
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Now it reminds me of that silly example

557
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 I gave at the beginning of the sermon about Ikea.

558
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 The reality is you don't have to be an engineer.

559
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 You don't have to be a rocket scientist.

560
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 Although sometimes it feels like it

561
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 to assemble a piece of Ikea furniture.

562
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It doesn't require all the degrees in the world

563
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 and all the carpentry skills,

564
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 but it does require you to have the ability

565
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 to follow the instructions.

566
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 I think God is calling us to be people who choose to follow.

567
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Evangelism is that.

568
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 It's an invitation to walk and work closely with God.

569
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 He invites us, we follow, we learn about him.

570
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 He transforms the way that we see and love people

571
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 so that we don't see them and love them naturally,

572
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 but we see them and love them supernaturally.

573
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 We see them the way he sees them

574
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 and we begin to love them the way that he loves them.

575
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 This story challenged my fears

576
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 because it doesn't matter what I do or who I am.

577
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 I can still be a part of what God is doing.

578
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And maybe evangelism is simply that,

579
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 putting ourselves in a position to follow God's spirit

580
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 and to rely on him.

581
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Maybe that's what it's all about.

582
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Us partnering with the supernatural God

583
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 to do what could never be done,

584
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 leading to lives transformed,

585
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 leading to people meeting Jesus.

586
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 And the things that stand to hinder us,

587
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 the things that we see as obstacles,

588
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 the things that cause the fear in our hearts

589
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 are merely distortions of reality.

590
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 As we sit with this,

591
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 I wanna give us three specific ways that we can pray.

592
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Three specific ways that we can ask God

593
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 to strengthen and help us.

594
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 And I think maybe all three of these won't be for you,

595
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 but I think at least one of them will hit something

596
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 in how you engage in this following God closely

597
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 and loving our neighbors through evangelism.

598
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 So the first thing is this.

599
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 I think we pray for God to help us see clearly.

600
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 It starts with what we see.

601
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 May we recognize that first and foremost,

602
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 we've been given everything that we need.

603
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 The spirit of God dwelling inside of you

604
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 makes you more than enough.

605
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 You can do it.

606
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 May we recognize that evangelism

607
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 is more about his work and our partnership.

608
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 We don't have to possess the right skills.

609
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 May we recognize the depth and the weight

610
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 of the power of the Holy Spirit in us

611
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 to reach those who do not know Jesus.

612
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 We haven't been given like a limited version

613
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 of the Holy Spirit or like a downgraded version

614
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 or the beta version.

615
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 We've been given the whole thing inside of us.

616
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 That same spirit that raises Christ from the dead

617
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 inside of you and inside of me.

618
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Our second prayer is this,

619
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 a prayer for guidance to follow.

620
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 The story was Philip being guided by the spirit of God.

621
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And I think for some of us,

622
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 that's exactly what we need to be able to hear God,

623
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 to be able to be guided by him into those situations,

624
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 to be able to hear him and then be able to respond.

625
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 God guided Philip and God can still

626
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 and still does guide you and me

627
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 beyond where our strengths are,

628
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 beyond where our current level of faith lies,

629
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 beyond the obstacles and beyond the fears.

630
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 God can guide you into chasing chariots.

631
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 The third thing is this,

632
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 we pray for confidence to act,

633
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 that we may boldly engage with unlikely candidates

634
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 for the gospel in our social circles,

635
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 in our work circles,

636
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 knowing that there's a different way that God sees it,

637
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 that there's a work that God is already doing

638
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 and we can be a part of that transformation.

639
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 That's what evangelism is.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 I feel like there might be people here today

641
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 or people watching who would look at this story

642
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 and say, "I don't have that courage.

643
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 "I don't have that ability.

644
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 "I don't believe God's holding out on us.

645
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 "I think he wants us to be able to do the same."

646
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 So our prayer today in this space is on how can we also,

647
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 God, how can we also be confident

648
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 to act when your spirit leads us?

649
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 So as the band comes back up,

650
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 let me just tell you that he wants to unleash a level

651
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 of new faith in our lives,

652
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 a level of love for our neighbor

653
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 that surpasses where we are right now.

654
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 He wants to get us to a place where we hear him well,

655
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 where we respond confidently and boldly to his promptings.

656
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 One of the prayers we might even pray is,

657
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 "God, I just wanna know your presence more.

658
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 "I wanna be able to hear

659
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 "and be aware of what your spirit is doing

660
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 "and working around me.

661
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 "Give me faith to follow you

662
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 "and to have a deepening trust in you

663
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 "and extend my love for my neighbor.

664
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 "Help me to love them like you love them."

665
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 And so if you will, let's go ahead and stand this morning.

666
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 And God, we come before you knowing the power

667
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 of the God of the scriptures,

668
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 knowing that he is still powerful,

669
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 that your mission to bring and call all men,

670
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 draw all men to yourself is still the same today.

671
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 And God, as we see this example of Philip's story,

672
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 God, would you start to speak to our hearts?

673
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Will you start to soften our hearts?

674
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Will you show us the ways in which you are drawing us

675
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 into these relationships, into these conversations,

676
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 into these spaces of just listening to our neighbor?

677
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 God, we know that you desire for all to know you.

678
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 And God, I pray that you start by breaking our hearts

679
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 to be the same.

680
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 God, would you show us the things

681
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 that may be right in front of us, but that we don't see?

682
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 God, the big opportunities,

683
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 and God, what we might see is the small opportunities.

684
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 Will you open our eyes to see that?

685
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Will you speak to us, Lord?

686
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 We ask for your spirit to speak, to lead, and to guide us

687
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 beyond what we're capable of doing,

688
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 so that we can also participate in the extraordinary things.

689
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Beyond where our faith is now, growing our faith in you.

690
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Beyond where our fears might hold us to.

691
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 God, we ask for guidance,

692
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 and we ask that you give us the courage to follow you.

693
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 The courage to step out, the boldness to see our neighbors

694
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 differently, a boldness to have a broken heart

695
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 for your gospel and for your people.

696
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 As you minister to us now, I pray that you remind us,

697
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 bring up some images, some names, some people

698
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 that we are constantly around,

699
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 who you've already began a work in.

700
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 Help us to be willing to chase chariots.

701
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 If it means they will come to know you.

702
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 We thank you for your spirit, for your guidance

703
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 in all of this.

704
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 We thank you that you empower us, give us the strength

705
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 that we need for today and for tomorrow.

706
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 We know it's in your hands and we keep it there.

707
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Thank you for these things, in Jesus' name.

708
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,580
 (gentle music)
