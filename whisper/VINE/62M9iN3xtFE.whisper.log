[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Amazing Grace was originally written by John Newton
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   to actually illustrate a sermon that he was preaching
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.340]   on New Year's Day of 1773.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.000]   And this has become perhaps one of the most famous hymns
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.240]   that has ever been written,
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.440]   one that's sung and celebrated in both Christian
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.660]   and secular context alike.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.680]   And it's a song where the words have deep meaning
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.420]   and resonance to Newton himself.
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.400]   Newton did not grow up a Christian,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.640]   but his life had so many ups and downs
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.160]   that it eventually brought him to a profound understanding
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.520]   of the work of grace in his own life.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.440]   At a young age, Newton was conscripted into the Royal Navy
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.140]   in those days in the Great Britain and the colonies.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.240]   And he spent the majority of his young life
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.200]   to about middle age serving in the Royal Navy.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.600]   But he eventually was let out of the Navy
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.940]   and for the decades beyond that,
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.940]   Newton was one of the leaders of the Atlantic slave trade.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.540]   He was actually perhaps one of the most prosperous
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.100]   and successful slave trade merchants
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600]   in the Atlantic Ocean in those days,
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480]   using all the knowledge and skill that he had gained
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.000]   from being in the Royal Navy to now partaking
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.900]   in the absolute injustice of the trade of human flesh.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.500]   In 1748, his slave vessel was just off the coast of Ireland
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.980]   and a massive storm ripped up.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.540]   One of those storms where everybody on board the ship
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.940]   thought that they were going to die.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.180]   And as the story happens and goes,
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.500]   Newton was standing on the deck of the ship
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.340]   and he looked out at the storm thinking he was about to die
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.220]   and cries out for God to have mercy on him.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.140]   The storm apparently subsides
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.420]   and the vessel was able to make it into the port.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.980]   And that was the spiritual conversion moment for Newton.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.900]   From that point onwards, he gave his life to Christ Jesus,
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.060]   a life that would eventually lead him
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.180]   to actually being a vicar in the Church of England,
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.700]   hence the sermon on New Year's Day in 1773.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.020]   But there's something that's a little less known
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.580]   about Newton.
[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.220]   That after that, a moment in 1748,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.380]   where he had his conversion to Jesus
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.380]   for the next 10 years, Newton was still a slave trader.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.180]   Think about that for a second.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.060]   On the one side, professing Jesus Christ
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.180]   as his Lord and Savior,
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.980]   and on the other side, still involved in the profit
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.620]   of the trade of human flesh.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.380]   And we know that towards the end of his life,
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.660]   he was beginning to wrestle with the ills
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.300]   and the sins of his past.
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.060]   And so he writes this hymn,
[00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.920]   and he says these profound words,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.460]   "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.380]   "that saved a wretch like me."
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.180]   Wretched indeed.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.660]   One who had been involved in one of the most wretched
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.020]   practices of all of human history.
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.260]   One who understood that if God's grace
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.780]   could be extended to him, that was truly amazing grace.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.140]   One who realized that out of the depth
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.580]   of the brokenness and the injustice of his past,
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.460]   he was now able to sing a song of truly amazing grace.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.240]   I mean, grace really is amazing, isn't it?
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.380]   Well, yes and no.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.380]   Because it wouldn't be until May 1st, 1807,
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.980]   that the slave trade was legally abolished
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.740]   in Great Britain and the colonies.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.400]   And I want you to imagine what it would have been like
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.020]   to have been a freed slave in that time.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.780]   By 1807, "Amazing Grace" was a song,
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.700]   a hymn that was being sung in the churches
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.380]   of the colonies all around.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.500]   Imagine for a moment,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.900]   if you were one of the freed slaves in 1807,
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.940]   standing in a congregation in the colonies
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.820]   that was largely white, and this hymn starts to be sung.
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.700]   I wonder if you could imagine how hard it must have been
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.340]   for that freed slave to sing that song.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.580]   To be willing to stand amongst all the white people
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.580]   around them and sing a song written by a slave trader.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.940]   An ex-slave trader, perhaps,
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.180]   but a slave trader none the self.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.860]   One who had for many years profited off of the misery
[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.620]   and the slavery of their own people.
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.020]   I think there may have been a little bitterness on the tongue
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.300]   of the one singing about a grace for that one.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.520]   And the question arises for us, I think, quite profoundly.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.420]   Is it possible to sing the song of the oppressor,
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.820]   even if the oppressor shows remorse?
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.580]   Is grace actually that amazing?
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.820]   That's the question I want you to hold in your mind
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.540]   and in your spirit as we step into looking
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.660]   at the third song of Advent that we're doing today.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.220]   We've looked at Mary's song,
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.380]   this song of a hope for those that are oppressed,
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.180]   a song that cries out and says that God is able
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.700]   to bring down the rulers and raise up the humble,
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.860]   send the rich away empty, but feed the starving.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.740]   And then last week we saw a song of Zechariah,
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.380]   a song for the rest, for the weary,
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.220]   those that are tired, those that are worn out,
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.540]   those that are hoping that a Messiah would come
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.460]   to set them free and give them that peace and security
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.060]   for all eternity, that there's a song
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.620]   for the rest, for the weary.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.580]   Well, this week and next week,
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.780]   we turn to looking at two songs in our Christmas story
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.420]   in scripture that happened after the birth of Jesus,
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.060]   Mary and Zechariah leading up to the birth,
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.420]   and now Simeon this week and next week,
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.660]   the angels singing a song after the birth of Jesus,
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.900]   a song that celebrates the reality of what's happening
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.740]   and importantly speaks of the themes
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.440]   of what this Jesus is actually going to do.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.100]   And in the song that we're gonna look at today,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.660]   Simeon, a prophet in the temple,
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.100]   brings a song that declares the work
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.780]   that Jesus will do in his kingdom
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.900]   through his life, death, and his resurrection.
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.900]   But it's a song that many in Israel
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.740]   were not yet ready to sing.
[00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.300]   Let me read this to you.
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.900]   It's from Luke chapter two, starting in verse 21,
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.380]   and we're gonna go 21 through to 32.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.580]   On the eighth day, this is the eighth day
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.900]   after Jesus' birth, when it was time to circumcise him,
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.900]   he was named Jesus.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.400]   The name the angel had given him
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.580]   before he had been conceived.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.680]   Now, when the time for their purification
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.740]   according to the Lord of Moses had been completed,
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.720]   Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.900]   to present him to the Lord,
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.940]   as it is written in the law of the Lord.
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.500]   Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord,
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.060]   and to offer there a sacrifice in keeping
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.860]   with what is said in the law of the Lord,
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.700]   a pair of doves or two young pigeons.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.240]   Now, there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon,
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.420]   who was righteous and devout.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.220]   He was waiting for the consolation of Israel,
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.640]   and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.820]   It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.060]   that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.900]   So now moved by the Spirit,
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.380]   he went into the temple courts.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.420]   And when the parents brought in the child Jesus
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.900]   to do for him what was custom of the law and required,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.900]   Simeon took him in his arms and praised God saying this,
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.940]   "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.540]   you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.580]   For my eyes have seen your salvation,
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.980]   which you have prepared in the sight of all people,
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.900]   a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.440]   and for glory to your people, Israel."
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.980]   Luke is a master storyteller,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.260]   and this is his last story about the birth of Jesus.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.120]   It's the last Advent Christmas story
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.500]   that we have in scripture.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.980]   And to put this story as vividly as he can for the reader,
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.940]   he pulls together some of the most important aspects
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.260]   of what Jewish religious life was like in those days.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:01.260]   He speaks of a temple, circumcision, dedication,
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.180]   offerings, and a song.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.220]   The very things that summarize perhaps
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.980]   how the Jews were to faithfully worship in those days.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.020]   And he paints a picture of Mary and Joseph
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.140]   once again being this faithful Jewish couple.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.980]   Everything he mentions here, Mary and Joseph do
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.780]   out of their faithful obedience to the law of Moses
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.900]   on the eighth day, they take Jesus
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.020]   and they give him his name as the angel Gabriel had said.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.500]   They circumcise him as was right to do
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.180]   for that firstborn male.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.420]   They then bring him 40 days later.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.520]   So this is about day 48 of Jesus's life.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.920]   They bring him to the temple.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.580]   Now, just for a second,
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.800]   imagine what that would have been like.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.700]   This is the very first time that Jesus, the Messiah,
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.420]   is brought into the temple.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.460]   The temple representing the house of God,
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.140]   the temple being the very place
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.700]   where the spirit of God dwelled.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.140]   I mean, for God, this must have been
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.940]   one of the most significant,
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.900]   most exciting moments of all creation.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:07.260]   Finally, Jesus in God's house.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.500]   Mary and Joseph have really no full concept
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.500]   of what they're doing.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.620]   All they're doing is remaining faithful
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.540]   to what was required of them.
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.620]   On that 48th day, they come themselves
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.680]   and they were to do three things.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.820]   First of all, purify themselves in a ritual of sacrifice.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.580]   In order to do that, they were supposed to bring
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.900]   either a lamb or a dove if you have a lot of money,
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.260]   or if you are poorer, like Mary and Joseph,
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.600]   you were to bring two pigeons.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.540]   These would be sacrificed to offer purification
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.420]   for you as the parents.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.740]   After that, you were then to present your child
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.620]   to the temple.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.420]   Present your child essentially to Yahweh, to God,
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.200]   and then to dedicate the child.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   Now, this is really important.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.300]   Dedicate the child for service
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.580]   for the rest of their life to the Lord.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.820]   I think this is brilliant because Mary and Joseph
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.020]   are just doing what's told for them to do.
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.600]   They're being obedient to the law,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.900]   but they're about to dedicate the Messiah
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.940]   to the service of his father,
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.540]   to do all the things that God has on his heart to do
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.860]   in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.220]   and the redemption of all history.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.420]   All of that is in front of them and they have no idea.
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.100]   And so as they bring this child in,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.100]   Simeon, a prophet, old, old prophet in the temple,
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.500]   is so filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.620]   that something unbelievable takes place.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.200]   And I want you to see what's happening here.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.300]   Mary and Joseph, very ordinary, very normal,
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.620]   are suddenly about to come into contact
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.940]   with God stepping into their mundane and normal.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.300]   We need to understand that out of the ordinary,
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.840]   God brings his extraordinary.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.560]   This is the way of God.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.860]   This is what the Christmas Advent story in scripture
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.960]   has been pointed towards,
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.060]   the fact that the Messiah, born in the ordinariest
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.740]   of a stable, something extraordinary into the world,
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.980]   all the angels in front of the shepherds,
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.580]   ordinary shepherds going about their normal day,
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.740]   the extraordinary of God breaking into that mundane,
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.900]   and yet again, right in this moment.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.100]   And what Luke's trying to tell the reader
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.380]   is something really simple,
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.460]   that it's in our normal, everyday lives
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.320]   that God often comes and changes them for his extraordinary.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.760]   And I think that's a real encouragement
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.360]   for each person in this room.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.820]   I mean, I don't know what's exactly going on
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:37.740]   in your life right now.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.100]   I don't know what the ups and downs might be,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.360]   but I do know the year we've all lived before.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.540]   And I know that it can often feel
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.000]   like it's overwhelming for us
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.540]   in terms of the mundaneness of life, the justice.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.460]   Hey, I've been coming to church every Sunday,
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.240]   and I do that, and I've got all these things.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.680]   And just like Susanna was praying,
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.420]   all this prayer and stuff that I've been holding in my heart
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.900]   and I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.380]   But what Luke is trying to say is this,
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.060]   the call of the people of God
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.820]   is not to the extraordinary, it's to the ordinary.
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.260]   We are the ones who are called just to be faithful,
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.140]   as Mary and Joseph were, to the law, to the things,
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.820]   to the obedience of God, knowing that it's our ordinary
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.100]   that gets invaded by God's extraordinary.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.460]   You don't need to be the greatest miracle worker.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.380]   That's actually God's job.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.900]   You don't need to have all the answers of everything.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.120]   That's actually God's prerogative.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.700]   What you're called to is simply faithfulness.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.180]   The beautiful, wonderful faithfulness of obedience to God
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.680]   in the best way that you can,
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.900]   even in the brokenness that we all have,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.940]   trying to be just faithful,
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.060]   and the reality of that, God steps in.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.260]   Mary and Joseph step into the temple
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.420]   in the ordinariness of obeying the law of Moses.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.860]   God breaks in with the extraordinary
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.220]   and does something that changes all of history.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.540]   You're about to step into the ordinary of your 2022.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.620]   And I wonder where your expectation sits.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.980]   Does it sit with this,
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.500]   oh, I don't really know what that year is gonna be about?
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.460]   Or is there something beginning to rise in your spirit
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.460]   that says, as I step into what might appear
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.860]   like the ordinary of 2022,
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.700]   I might have a heart that would expect the extraordinary
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.340]   of what God might want to do.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.940]   Are you with me?
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.260]   So Luke's trying to open up this idea
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.180]   of what faithfulness looks like.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.820]   And then he shifts the spotlight
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.020]   from the faithfulness of Mary and Joseph
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:45.100]   to the faithfulness of Simeon, this old prophet.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.860]   Let me read to you just a couple of verses
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.860]   of how Luke describes Simeon in verse 25.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.420]   Now, there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.860]   who was righteous and devout.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.820]   He was waiting for the consolation of Israel
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.940]   and the Holy Spirit was upon him,
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.380]   for it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.580]   that he would not die before he had seen the Lord Jesus.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.020]   Now, this is awesome.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.420]   Here's a man who has been given by the Spirit of God
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.900]   a word over his life, a calling over his life.
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.140]   And Luke describes him as righteous and devout.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.220]   I mean, if Mary and Joseph were like this beautiful picture
[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.580]   of faithful Jewish people,
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.100]   here's the picture of a faithful religious man,
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.220]   a faithful prophet who's righteous and devout.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.340]   And God has said that he is waiting,
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.780]   longing for the consolation of Israel.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.900]   What he wants, in other words, is for Israel to rise up,
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.140]   for Israel to receive the glory and the goodness
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.180]   that God has for it,
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.860]   that Israel would be established once again
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.780]   to live freely in their land,
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.940]   the consolation of all that Israel had meant for.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.260]   This man is holding that passion in his heart.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.980]   And not only that, but at some point,
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.220]   God has come to him and said this,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.740]   "Hey, Simeon, this is really awesome.
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.100]   "Check this out.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.340]   "You're not gonna die until you've seen the Messiah."
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.580]   Can you imagine how exciting that would have been?
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.500]   Says Simeon, "I'm going to see the Messiah."
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.220]   Now, he probably got that word when he was in his 40s.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.660]   And you can imagine it, right?
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.980]   Every single day, today could be the day
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.780]   where I will see the Messiah.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.620]   And then he'd get to the end of the day and he'd be like,
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.780]   "Okay, it wasn't today."
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.740]   And then he got up the next day,
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.980]   "Today might be the day that I get to see the Messiah."
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.780]   And then he goes to bed that night going,
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.660]   "It wasn't this day."
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.780]   And now here he is,
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.260]   and the Bible is describing him as very, very old.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.460]   And it's like he's sort of saying,
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.820]   "Gee, God, I want to die.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.400]   "Like I'm really old now, right?
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   "Could today please be the day that I see the Messiah?
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.120]   "'Cause that would be really good for me and my family.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.200]   "And for all of Israel, yes,
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.700]   "but for me too, particularly, I want to go home."
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.180]   So here he is on this day.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.420]   On the ordinary mundaneness of this day.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.100]   And the Bible says something really important.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.660]   It says this in verse 27.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.740]   It says, "Moved by the Spirit,
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.540]   "he went into the temple courts.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.100]   "And when the parents brought the child Jesus in
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.380]   "to do what was just ordinary, mundane,
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.540]   "the custom, the law required,
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.860]   "Simeon takes him in his arms."
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.540]   Now, this is nuts.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.640]   Could you imagine this moment?
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.940]   The temple court is a busy public space.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.340]   It's not the inner courts that were more private.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.820]   The outer court, the temple courts were busy.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.140]   And that was where you could buy your sacrifices
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.980]   and everything.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.620]   It was loud and noisy and all of this.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.100]   And here's Mary and Joseph.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.740]   And they've just walked up the steps of the temple.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.220]   They've entered under the archways into the outer courts.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:48.460]   They're holding Jesus.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.300]   And you can imagine,
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.920]   they are overwhelmed by the cacophony of noise
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.760]   and everything.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.700]   This is an overwhelming moment.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.340]   And not only that, but here's the old man, Simeon,
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.940]   who's wondering is today the day,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.100]   who's filled suddenly with the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.300]   And he sees this young couple
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.220]   and he walks intently towards them,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.540]   as if, I'm just gonna pretend you're Mary and Joseph, okay?
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.660]   Don't freak out, it's true.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.740]   But he walks intently towards them.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.060]   And he, without saying anything,
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.300]   grabs the child from their arms and he holds it aloft.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.340]   It's like the "Lion King" moment, right?
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:27.340]   He's like, (singing in foreign language)
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.380]   Now, could you imagine what that would have felt like
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.600]   for Mary and Joseph?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.740]   Couple of years ago, quite a few years ago now,
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.820]   when Mia was just two years old,
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.580]   Chris and I were in Pacific Place one day,
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.620]   and we're just pushing Mia in a stroller
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.020]   through Pacific Place.
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.900]   And out of nowhere, this lady, this older lady,
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.180]   Chinese lady, she bursts forward and she gets on the knees.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.580]   She stops the stroller, she gets on her knees,
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.340]   and she starts to touch Mia's face and play with her hair.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.380]   And she starts to speak Cantonese over her.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.180]   And this is a stranger to us.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.420]   And we're like, "What are you doing?
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.860]   "This is our child, back off."
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:11.940]   Here's Simeon, and he takes Jesus in his arms.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.660]   And I don't know if he held Jesus aloft,
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:14.860]   that's probably me just pretending, right?
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:18.300]   But he takes Jesus in his arms,
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.340]   filled with the Holy Spirit, and he sings a song.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.980]   This is Simeon's moment.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.980]   He's waited years.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.380]   I want you to think about this.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.900]   This is another picture of faithfulness.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.100]   And you need to know that faithfulness
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.940]   does not guarantee you an easy life.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.100]   You need to know that faithfulness doesn't always mean
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.820]   you're gonna suddenly walk into the blessings of God.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.780]   Faithfulness, like what Susanna shared,
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.660]   sometimes requires some patience.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.100]   It requires doing the same thing in and out,
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.540]   in and out, in and out,
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.420]   trusting that God will one day break through
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.900]   with his extraordinary.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.220]   This is Simeon's moment.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.060]   And I tell you what,
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.540]   if ever somebody had a prepared speech,
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.820]   surely it was this man.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.740]   Years of preparation for this one moment.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.660]   I mean, he must have thought,
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.780]   what is it that I will say?
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.900]   What is it that I will sing?
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.060]   What will I prophesy over this child?
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.020]   But filled with the Holy Spirit, he takes the child,
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.260]   and I want you to see the prepared speech
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.740]   that Simeon had on his heart.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.060]   Are you ready for this?
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.780]   Starting in verse 29, this is what he sings.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.780]   He sings, "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.380]   "you now can dismiss your servant in peace.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.140]   "I can die."
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.100]   That's the first thing he says, right?
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.020]   Like, this is taking a while, God.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.980]   I'm old.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.980]   Then he says this,
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.740]   "For my eyes have seen your salvation,
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:48.780]   "which you have prepared in the sight of all the people."
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.620]   And notice what he says,
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.380]   "A light for revelation to the Gentiles
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.180]   "and for glory to your people, Israel."
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.260]   A light for the revelation for the Gentiles
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.100]   and glory to your people, Israel.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.300]   He holds Jesus in his hands,
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.660]   and he says, "This is what you need to know, Israel.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.180]   "This one is a light for the revelation to the Gentiles
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.420]   "and the glory to us, Israel."
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.260]   Hang on a sec.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.020]   Sit with this for a second.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.300]   Let me read this to you again.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.780]   He says this.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.940]   "The first thing," he says about Jesus,
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.580]   "He is a light for the revelation to the Gentiles."
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.740]   Whoa, whoa, hang on one sec.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.500]   I'm gonna read it one more time.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.900]   I just wanna make sure that's right.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.780]   "A light for the revelation to the Gentiles."
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.740]   The first thing that comes out of this faithful,
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.660]   Old Testament-type prophet,
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.700]   one who's righteous and devout,
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.860]   is he says, "This Jesus is gonna be the salvation,
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.340]   "the hope, the redemption, the life to the hated,
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.820]   "to the oppressing, to the painful,
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:04.820]   "to the unrighteous, the unclean Gentile."
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:10.340]   It's almost like if there was ever in history a moment
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.820]   where there is like the ripping of a record
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.940]   off of the needle, and it's like this (imitates ripping)
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.780]   It's like, what?
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.220]   Hang on a second.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.420]   Like, that's the last thing the Jewish people
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.060]   were expecting to hear.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.380]   Like this Messiah, surely He cannot be
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.940]   for the one who's oppressing us.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.860]   Surely this Messiah cannot be for that unrighteous,
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.860]   unclean, disgusting, those people
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.660]   that lord themselves over us,
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.980]   those ones who have subjected us to that point
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.020]   for 600 years, these Romans that have us under control.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.020]   No, that's not what we want.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.780]   We are wanting a Messiah that does the second part
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.020]   of what Simeon says.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.140]   He's a glory to us in Israel.
[00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.460]   Yes, we want a Messiah like that.
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.460]   I can get behind a Messiah who's the glory to Israel.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.860]   But if you're asking me to sing a song
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.500]   about a Messiah who's the glory to our enemies,
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.940]   I've got a problem with that.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.020]   Are you with me?
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:11.180]   It's interesting, isn't it?
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:17.140]   That grace is so often only amazing when it's grace for us.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.220]   Think about that for a second.
[00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.740]   That so often grace is only really amazing
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.700]   when it's grace for people like us.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.620]   Because surely God's grace is for people like us, right?
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.180]   You know, the good people, the righteous ones,
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.700]   you know, the ones that deserve it,
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.020]   the ones that have been under oppression
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.580]   for all these years.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.060]   You know, the ones that have been called
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.620]   the chosen people of God,
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.900]   the ones that fill the pews of the churches
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.740]   around the world.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.580]   I mean, we understand that grace is being given to us
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.140]   the favor of God placed upon us.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.700]   Oh, I can sing a song like that.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.220]   ♪ Amazing grace ♪
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.660]   ♪ How sweet the sound ♪
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.660]   ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.420]   You know, the one like me,
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.060]   you know, the one that deserves it,
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.740]   the one that's kind of, you know,
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.540]   come and align themselves with God,
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.500]   who's given his life to Jesus,
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.220]   who comes to church as much as I can,
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.980]   who sings and prays and believes and is faithful
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.140]   like Mary and Joseph and Simeon.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:24.380]   I can sing a song about grace for people like me.
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.220]   Are you with me?
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:29.340]   That's not the song that Simeon is singing.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.300]   That's not the song that he invites Israel to sing.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.220]   Let me sing you the song that Simeon is singing.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.540]   It sounds more like this.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.060]   ♪ Amazing grace ♪
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.020]   ♪ How sweet the sound ♪
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.340]   ♪ That saved some wretches like them ♪
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:55.540]   That's what Simeon's singing,
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.260]   that this Jesus comes at Christmas,
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:04.260]   the advent of Christ, comes to save all people.
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.100]   Simeon is putting right before Israel
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.700]   the hardest of realities,
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.980]   that Christ is on behalf of the other,
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.460]   the one on the other side of the aisle,
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.860]   the one that we struggle to like,
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.740]   the one that we have a problem with,
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.300]   the one that has come and done something perhaps to us,
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.140]   the one that we deeply struggle and wrestle with.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.700]   It's that one, Simeon is saying,
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.660]   that this Christ Messiah has also come for.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.420]   It's not just an amazing grace for you.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.420]   It's an amazing grace for anyone
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.460]   who would open their lives to the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:51.460]   A slave trader can sing that song.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:58.280]   The question is, can we?
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.740]   Like, can we actually sing a song of grace
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.500]   for the one on the other side,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.260]   the one who is different to us,
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.060]   the one who doesn't have our theology,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.860]   doesn't have our lifestyle, doesn't have our practices,
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.420]   doesn't believe in our God,
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.180]   doesn't do things that we think are appropriate,
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.020]   the one who's out there or wherever it might be,
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.660]   can we also believe as a church that this Jesus came,
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.740]   not just for the nice people,
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.220]   whatever that is defined as,
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:38.380]   but that this Jesus came for all people,
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.960]   the slave trader and the free slave alike.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.660]   Now, here's the powerful thing.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.420]   Simeon's song is not a new song.
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.820]   This is just picking up the threads
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.620]   of God's redemptive heart in all of redemptive history.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.180]   And in fact, Simeon is going right back
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.180]   into the Old Testament
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.020]   and drawing some of those themes out.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.320]   He's going right back to Genesis chapter 12,
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.520]   where it all started,
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.840]   where Abraham was called to leave his family and move out
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.120]   and begin a new family,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.920]   where the nation of Israel itself was birthed.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.280]   At that moment, God appears to Abraham,
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.240]   shows him all the stars in the sky,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.040]   and says, "Your descendants from you
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.120]   will be like those of the stars in the sky."
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:18.960]   And then he says this,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   "And through you, you will be a blessing to all nations."
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.440]   I mean, right at the foundation of it all,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.560]   blessing to all nations.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.260]   And then the Old Testament prophetic tradition
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.140]   keeps the going,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.740]   the idea that God always wants to redeem,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.140]   not just the Jew, but also the Gentile.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.740]   In fact, the chapter of most central understanding
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.860]   of the Messiah coming as a child,
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.180]   Isaiah chapter nine,
[00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.500]   "For unto us a child is born."
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.180]   Now, Isaiah's prophecy about a child coming
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.980]   who would be the one who would grow up to redeem Israel,
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.220]   right at the start of that prophetic chapter,
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.000]   here's what Isaiah says.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.920]   He says, "God will bring favor on the Gentiles of Galilee.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.900]   Those who are in darkness will walk in light."
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.400]   It's right there in the Old Testament prophetic tradition,
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.520]   but somehow the Jews had begun to forget that
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.720]   so that when Simeon grabs this child
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.360]   and begins to sing a song like this,
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.280]   it was a song that was deeply challenging to them.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.260]   Like how a freed slave in 1807
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.960]   might have struggled to sing a song
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   written by an ex-slave trader.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.360]   So Israel struggles to sing a song
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.600]   about a hope and redemption for their oppressors.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.680]   I think Mary herself would have struggled
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.600]   to sing this song if we're honest.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.720]   What was her song about?
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.760]   Her song was about the turning of the tables.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.400]   Her song was about the rulers being brought down
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.920]   and the humble being lifted up.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.800]   Her song was about hope for those that are under oppression.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.440]   And I love this about the Christmas story,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.320]   and we need to see this as the global church,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.280]   particularly in this hour of our own history,
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.720]   that in the Bible Christmas story,
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.760]   yes, we have that beautiful picture
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.640]   of the turning upside down of the kingdom of God
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.440]   and the way that works in this world.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.080]   We have hope for the oppressed,
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.360]   hope for those downtrodden, hope for those,
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.440]   'cause God's gonna come and turn the tables, absolutely.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.960]   But we've also got in the same story,
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.960]   a song to be sung about God's grace being for everyone,
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.040]   even for the enemy and the oppressor.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.320]   Those two things are not at wars with one another.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.640]   They sit side by side in the beauty
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.360]   of what Christmas is all about.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.440]   Out of the ordinary, God brings an extraordinary.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:49.380]   And I think if we're honest with ourselves,
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:53.920]   we would realize that we also can struggle
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.500]   to sing a song of that kind of amazing grace.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.840]   Each one of us has an other in our lives.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.800]   I want you to take a moment just to think a little bit
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.840]   about who that other might be for you.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.160]   Perhaps for some of us in this room,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.740]   the other is a colleague,
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:17.160]   a colleague who has hurt us, who has done something,
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.400]   who has led in a certain way that we feel kind of overrun
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.000]   by a colleague that we're struggling to like
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.640]   and get on with.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.120]   Or perhaps for some of you in this room,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.440]   the other is an ex-boyfriend or an ex-girlfriend,
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.400]   somebody who's perhaps hurt you,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.380]   somebody who's betrayed you, broken your heart,
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.920]   said something, done something,
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.560]   and you're still trying to deal
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.420]   with the aftermath of that reality.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.440]   Perhaps for some of you in this room,
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.680]   the other is your parent.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.600]   And your parent has never said to you once
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.880]   that they truly loved you.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.280]   You've never heard those words.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.240]   You've never felt adequate enough for them.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.640]   You never felt you were good enough for them.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.260]   And you've carried and harbored a sense of bitterness
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.040]   and resentment, even though perhaps you are open to them
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.200]   and you're in relationship with them,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.680]   but deep inside you struggle
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.580]   to truly find yourself loving them.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:10.120]   Or perhaps in this room, the other is a friend,
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.920]   a friend who has done something or hurt something
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.720]   or been in some way that has really turned you upside down,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.380]   maybe betrayed you or whatever it is,
[00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.660]   did something you didn't expect
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.480]   and you're struggling to let go of that.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.260]   Maybe in this room, your other is a person of authority.
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.800]   Maybe it's a pastor or a leader
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.440]   or someone in authority of your life
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.240]   who has made you feel less than who you truly are.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.560]   Perhaps for you, the other is someone
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.760]   who has a political perspective different from yours.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.640]   And you've seen and heard what they've done
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.760]   and you don't like it and you've been annoyed
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.920]   and frustrated by their posts on social media
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.520]   and their actions and you've harbored anger
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.380]   and upset and bitterness towards them.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.740]   Our other could be a lot of different things,
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.080]   but the reality is each one of us
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.040]   has another other in our lives.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.180]   And the challenge of Simeon's song
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:04.180]   and the beauty of Christmas is whether we can sing a song
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:09.620]   that has grace amazing enough that would enable us
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.920]   to sing that song about the other.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.660]   Not that as Christians, we should subject ourselves
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.380]   under the abuse of the other.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.940]   Not that it should be okay that we continue to be victims
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.940]   under the wheels of injustice, no.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.100]   But we need to make sure that we guard as Christians
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.580]   against a hardness of heart
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.420]   towards those that have done things to us.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.820]   And we need to guard against this reality
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.460]   that sometimes we have this kind of comfortable
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.540]   Christian theology, which puts us always on the good side
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.900]   and others on the bad side.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.420]   And we need to realize that like Simeon
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.660]   cradling Jesus in his arms,
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.420]   Christ cradles the church in his arms.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.420]   And he says, "Church, can you sing the song of grace
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.540]   "that is so amazing that it's even
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:10.020]   "for the one you don't like?"
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:14.660]   One of the great significant foundations
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.980]   of the Christian faith is this,
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.280]   that in the coming of Jesus,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.160]   we have the coming of the reality of grace for all.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.420]   A grace so amazing that it is offered
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.900]   even to the one that we think does not deserve it.
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:34.540]   Can you sing that song?
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.980]   A few years ago, quite a few years ago,
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.460]   as I was starting to be a pastor,
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.660]   I'd quit my job in finance
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.820]   and I had decided to become a pastor.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.980]   And so I'd gone away and done some studies, come back,
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.380]   and the Vine was giving me my shot.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.740]   They were giving me a chance to be a pastor.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.820]   And I was beginning to preach a little bit in the church
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.360]   and I was beginning to get a little bit of a platform
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.980]   in the church where I was preaching a little bit regularly.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.620]   And right there at the start, a man in the church,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.740]   here at the Vine, made it his mission
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.820]   to make me feel as bad as possible
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.980]   about the decision I had made.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.880]   He would come up to me after, I'm not even joking,
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.780]   every sermon, every week I preached.
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.940]   And he would come up to me straight away.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.320]   He'd be the first in the prayer line.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.780]   And he would never come forward and ask for prayer.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.420]   He would only come forward to critique what I said.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.940]   He would tell me all the things that I had forgotten,
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.540]   all the stories that I should have told,
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.260]   all the passages of scripture that changes
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.420]   and refutes everything that I had just preached.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.660]   If he didn't catch me on the Sunday,
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.660]   he would send me an email on the Monday.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.140]   He was faithful.
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:47.700]   Not the kind of faithfulness I like, but he was faithful.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.820]   He would send me an email on Monday
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.940]   with a litany of stuff that I could have done better.
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.480]   This went on, I kid you not, it went on for years.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.720]   And I'm grateful to my wife,
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.900]   'cause without her I would have crumbled.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.700]   And I'm grateful to God's presence,
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.460]   that I managed to somehow get through it all.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.300]   I haven't thought about that guy for a number of years,
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.580]   but as I was preparing this message a couple of weeks ago
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.620]   and thinking about what I was gonna preach,
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.360]   immediately he came to mind again.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.860]   And it was the Holy Spirit saying this,
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.080]   "You can't sing that song about him, can you?"
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:28.900]   And I was like, "No."
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.600]   I believe grace is amazing, but it's not that amazing.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.260]   And I knew that I could not stand before you today
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.100]   and preach this message without having gotten myself
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.860]   into the point of truly forgiving that person
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.700]   and releasing them, to truly wanting
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:51.500]   the light of revelation and the beauty of God's presence
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.940]   to be in their lives.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.020]   And I can stand before you today
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.300]   and tell you that I've done that.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.060]   And here's how I was able to do it.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.100]   Verse 27, "Moved by the Spirit,
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.340]   "Simeon went into the temple courts."
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.980]   The only way that we are able to truly sing the song
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:15.460]   of the one who has offended and hurt us,
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.620]   a song of great, amazing grace for them,
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.940]   is through a move of the Spirit.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.460]   It cannot be done in our own strength.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.140]   It cannot be done by some good strategy.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.360]   It can't be done by just trying to work it up inside of us.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.580]   I thought that's what I had done years ago with this person,
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.520]   but the Holy Spirit brought it back to me
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.660]   because I hadn't really dealt with it.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.740]   The only way you are able to sing a song of grace
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.340]   for the one on the other side of your life
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.740]   is by a move of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.100]   And I believe that there is nothing more Christmas
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.240]   or Advent for you in this season
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.540]   than for you to not just receive an amazing grace,
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.280]   but for you to truly be able to offer an amazing grace.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.460]   Could we sing that song?
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.080]   I wonder whether you'd stand with me,
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.880]   and I wanna create some space for us to pray.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:11.500]   I wanna encourage you, if this is speaking to you today,
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.440]   our eyes are closed, you're not doing this for my benefit.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.080]   The Holy Spirit wants to come now
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.560]   and move by His Spirit on you.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.420]   And so if this message has been important to you
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:30.300]   for whatever reason, if there's an other that you know
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.720]   that you're struggling to offer grace to,
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.760]   I wonder whether you'd just open your hands before you,
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.300]   just quietly, no one's looking.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.260]   'Cause I wanna pray for those in this room
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.980]   where this is important for you,
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.480]   where there's a song to be sung
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.540]   that you're struggling to sing right now.
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.320]   Father, I wanna pray now just for everybody in this room,
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.740]   Lord, whose hands are before you.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.800]   Lord, we do that as a symbol of humility.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.240]   And I wanna pray now for the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.560]   to do what my words, what no sermon
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.680]   or anything can really do.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   The work of the Holy Spirit to enable us
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:21.220]   to find a place of healing, a place of restoration,
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.700]   a place of reconciliation, if that's possible.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:28.660]   It may not be possible for every circumstance and situation,
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:35.760]   but a profound place of grace.
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.480]   Father, we need this so much.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.220]   Father, I pray for each person in this room
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.320]   that your Holy Spirit would come now.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.220]   Lord, Simeon was moved by your Spirit.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.220]   We need to be moved by your Spirit, Lord.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.900]   We cannot forgive these people.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.660]   We cannot release this burden.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.100]   We cannot genuinely sing of grace for them
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.260]   unless it's a move of your Spirit in us.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:07.580]   So I wanna give you time and space now.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:17.420]   Father, we need this so much in our city right now,
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.660]   where families have been torn apart,
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.160]   marriages have been broken,
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.880]   where companies struggle,
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:33.300]   where divisions are deep over the last two to three years.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.500]   Father, we need a profound work of your Spirit
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.840]   on the church in our city.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.500]   And we need a profound work of your Spirit
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.960]   on and in the streets of this city.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.700]   And what better time for that work of the Spirit
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.540]   than Advent?
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.120]   (gentle music)
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.620]   Lord, I wanna pray that songs would rise up in this city
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:01.180]   where we can genuinely say a light of revelation
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.100]   for that one.
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.380]   Grace and mercy, God, for that one.
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:12.140]   And Holy Spirit, I ask that you would move now
[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.660]   for these ones in this room.
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.620]   Sometimes we recognize, Lord,
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.660]   that the ones that we are at enmity with
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.160]   are sitting around us in the pews of our churches.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.900]   And so, Lord, I wanna pray for a restoration of division
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.320]   in this church at the Vine.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.860]   Wherever the enemy has gotten in
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.640]   to create division in the last few years,
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.500]   we come against that in the name of Jesus.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.420]   And Lord, we pray for a mercy and a grace
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.900]   to pour out on the Vine, pour out on us,
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.920]   so that we might be able to walk towards one another
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.760]   with true peace in our hearts.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.600]   (gentle music)
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.520]   As Simeon would say,
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.040]   "Lord, you can now dismiss your servant in peace."
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.760]   Lord, I know that there are many in this room
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.920]   that have been carrying and harboring disappointment,
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   bitterness, hurt, in some cases for very good reasons.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.080]   Would a move of your Spirit come, Lord,
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:16.560]   that would enable us to truly experience amazing grace?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   I just pray you would allow yourself
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.640]   to sit in this moment of ministry.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.160]   I'd like if the team in a second
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.480]   just begin to sing over us,
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.080]   but don't feel like you need to rush into worship.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.280]   In fact, it might be nice for them to sing over you
[00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.400]   the words of this hymn.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.980]   And in your own heart, just allow the Holy Spirit
[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.360]   to continue to heal and to speak to you.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.780]   Allow His profound work upon you.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.200]   (soft music)
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:42:02.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
