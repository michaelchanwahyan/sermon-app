1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 Yeah, it's great to see you all be here.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,520
 I want to take you back to my teenage years.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:20,320
 So when I was a teenager, I had the opportunity to try out for my state basketball team.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,640
 Now in Germany, there are 16 states, and if you make it on the state basketball team,

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,580
 they invest in your development.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,280
 So it really is a track to be successful and to be seen, to be noticed.

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,080
 Also, you get to compete against the best of the best in Germany.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,600
 And so there's, I don't remember how many spots is on the team, maybe 15 or something.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,560
 And so tryout day comes, I go, and the first half of the day, it, I mean, everything goes

10
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
 wrong.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,000
 It is just not working.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,460
 And I have to say, I got so discouraged that I thought it was over.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,080
 And so I disengaged and I actually gave up.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,700
 And so in the afternoon, I just did my thing.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,400
 They cut two players that day, and I was one of them.

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,440
 And the other guy wasn't good.

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,300
 And for me afterwards, it bugged me.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,940
 I was so bothered by my mindset that I disengaged and I gave up.

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,420
 And actually turned into one of those life lessons, I'm never going to do that again.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,020
 I'm never going to just give up that easy again.

21
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,900
 I'm going to, if I have an opportunity, I'm going to fight for it.

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,100
 But it showed me the importance of how our mindset impacts, you know, impacts things.

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,020
 And if you think about it, this is true for relationships, right?

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,340
 You can be engaged in our relationships, our friendships, our marriages, or we can disengage.

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,180
 So and whether we're engaged or disengaged makes a huge difference, a huge difference.

26
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,180
 Now what about engaging?

27
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,260
 And what about our mindset towards the city of Hong Kong?

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:21,580
 Are we engaged with what is happening here, with what God wants to do here, or are we

29
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
 disengaged?

30
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:30,140
 And it doesn't matter who we are, you know, whether you're an expat, whether you're a

31
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,500
 local Hong Konger, whether you're a domestic helper, whatever your background is, it doesn't

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 matter.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,740
 You know, God desires for us.

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,100
 He desires for us to be engaged.

35
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:53,460
 And so what I want to do with you today in this message, I want to explore with you a

36
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:00,380
 question and it's this question, what does God's word have to say about the mindset with

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,460
 which he wants us to relate to the city?

38
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,480
 You know, what does he have to say about that?

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,760
 And why does it matter?

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,300
 What difference does it make?

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,900
 What perspective we have?

42
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,300
 So I want to explore that with you through the text.

43
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:26,900
 And so we're in a new sermon series that we have entitled Seeking the Peace of the City.

44
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,740
 And throughout this series, we want to explore how is God inviting us, his people, his church,

45
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:39,420
 and the places where he has placed you in, in your workplace, in your family, in your

46
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,060
 neighborhood, how is he inviting us to be people who contribute to the flourishing and

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,060
 the thriving of others?

48
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:56,140
 How is he inviting us to bring those around us up, to be about others?

49
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,980
 And so that's what we're going to explore in the sermon series.

50
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,060
 I want to give you a little bit of an overview.

51
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,740
 So today is Seek the Peace of the City.

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,020
 Next week we have Pastor John, so excited about that.

53
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,860
 He's going to talk about contributing to the peace of the city.

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,540
 Then we have Vision Sunday, which will also fit into that overall theme.

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,980
 And then finally, Pray for the Peace of the City.

56
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,860
 Pastor Chapman is going to be preaching on that day.

57
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:29,260
 So this is part of what I believe God is leading us as a church family into this year.

58
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,460
 And this sermon series is really to unite us and to align our hearts with each other

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,800
 in this mission.

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,280
 Because last year we focused, we had a soft launch, we had a public launch, we got this

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,660
 building ready, and that's awesome and that's amazing, and praise God.

62
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,740
 But really, if we're not engaged in the city, if we're not serving, if we're not loving,

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,420
 if we're not bringing others up around us, we're really missing out on what God wants

64
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,420
 to do to us.

65
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,100
 So this year is crucial for us as a church, and so that's what we're going to explore.

66
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,460
 I'm excited about this.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,820
 I'm excited to see what God is going to do this year, and I hope you are as well.

68
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:17,380
 So we're going to go to Jeremiah 29, but before we go into the specific text, so this is an

69
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:26,900
 Old Testament book, it was written, or the part that we're going to look at, in 597,

70
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:35,900
 before Christ, Babylon, Israel was rebelling against them, and so they went into Israel

71
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:43,020
 and they took the leaders, they took professionals, the artisans, they took military leaders,

72
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,220
 and they took them captive and they brought them back to Babylon.

73
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,220
 Now there was a strategy behind that, because they wanted to assimilate the leaders of this

74
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,300
 country into their culture.

75
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,700
 So assimilate means they wanted them to become like them, they just wanted to absorb them.

76
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:09,420
 And so they actually gave people quite a bit of freedom when they were in Babylon, but

77
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:15,820
 they wanted them to lose their distinct identity as a people of God.

78
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,680
 So that was their plan, their strategy that they used.

79
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,260
 And that would then, they thought, also take care of rebellion.

80
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,540
 So they were playing the long game with this strategy.

81
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:34,580
 Now Israel, they know that, they're forcefully displaced to Babylon, and instead of immersing

82
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,300
 themselves in what's going on, they actually are on the outskirts of the city of Babylon

83
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,460
 living alongside a canal.

84
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,660
 So they're huddling within their group of people, and they're resisting this attempt

85
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,500
 to assimilate them.

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,900
 Now the prophet Jeremiah, he was mainly active in Judea and Jerusalem, that's where most

87
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,860
 of his work takes place.

88
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,660
 But in this case, he writes a letter and he sends it to the exiles.

89
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,540
 And so that's what we're going to read, that's what we're going to look at.

90
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,420
 So Jeremiah 29, starting with verse 4, it says this, "This is what the Lord Almighty,

91
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,420
 the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.

92
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,660
 Build houses and settle down.

93
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,260
 Plant gardens and eat what they produce.

94
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,140
 Marry, have sons, daughters, find wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage

95
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,900
 so that they too may have sons and daughters."

96
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,940
 Very focused on having a lot of children, right?

97
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,940
 "Increase in number there, do not decrease.

98
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:50,380
 Also seek the peace and the prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into

99
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
 exile.

100
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,500
 Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too prosper."

101
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,540
 Yes, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says.

102
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,340
 Do not let the prophets and the diviners among you deceive you.

103
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,820
 Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have.

104
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,380
 They are prophesying lies to you.

105
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,400
 In my name, I have not sent them, declares the Lord.

106
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,340
 This is what the Lord says.

107
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,400
 When 70 years have completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise

108
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,940
 to bring you back to this place.

109
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,460
 For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you, not to harm

110
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,580
 you, plans to give you hope and a future.

111
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,900
 So this is part of the letter that Jeremiah writes them.

112
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,820
 And so what I want to, the way I want to unpack it with you is look at what does this have

113
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:53,460
 to say about the mindset, about the posture that God wants his people to have in relationship

114
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,180
 to the city, and then also ultimately, of course, what does that mean for us about the

115
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:04,880
 posture and the mindset that God wants us to have in regards to Hong Kong.

116
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,500
 So first we see that Jeremiah warns the exiles of false prophets and what they're saying.

117
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,340
 So in verse eight through nine, you know, he says, I'm not going to read it all because

118
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,940
 I just read it, but I'll read some parts.

119
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,400
 It says, do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you.

120
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,640
 So they were deceiving people.

121
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,420
 And he also says, they are prophesying lies to you in my name.

122
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,060
 I have not sent them.

123
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,020
 And so they're being deceived and they're believing in lies, but they also kind of want

124
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,260
 to.

125
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,180
 I don't know if you ever have that where you want something to be true so much so that

126
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,660
 you believe it, even if it's not true.

127
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,660
 I have, I'm sure.

128
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,740
 I'm sure you have as well.

129
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,900
 So Jeremiah is warning the exiles of these false prophets among them who spreading lies.

130
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,500
 Now, why it's not stated exactly, what they were saying, and we noticed from, you know,

131
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,100
 the surrounding context and in scripture is that this will not last for a long time and

132
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,660
 that they will return within a short period of time.

133
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,660
 So that's the message that, that those false prophets are giving the Israelites.

134
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,940
 It's just, just hold on for a little bit and then we'll go back to the promised land.

135
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,500
 And God warns them that these prophecies, their lies, it's not true.

136
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,940
 And he even tells them you're going to be there 70 years.

137
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,060
 That's not a few months or a couple of years.

138
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,820
 That's, that's a lifetime.

139
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,180
 But, but these false prophecies and the Israelites believing them, it actually really impacts

140
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:46,260
 our mindset because if you think you're going to return, you're not really going to be engaged

141
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,500
 in what's going on.

142
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,540
 You're not really going to invest yourself in you.

143
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,140
 You're like, I don't even want to have a child in this place.

144
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,340
 I don't want to raise someone here.

145
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,860
 I, you know, these, I'm not going to start a business here.

146
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,260
 And so, so does this, this mindset or these lies lead to this mindset of like, I'm not

147
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
 going to be engaged.

148
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
 I'm going to be disengaged.

149
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,100
 We're just going to be in our huddle.

150
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,500
 We're going to wait this out.

151
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,020
 We're going to put things on pause and then, you know, whenever God takes us back, we'll

152
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,060
 go back.

153
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,420
 And Jeremiah is really confronting that.

154
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,300
 And, and for them, that must, must have been such hard news to hear.

155
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
 You're being deceived.

156
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
 You're being lied to.

157
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,580
 Now, I recently, totally different country, context, so not from here.

158
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,740
 I talked to someone where I really sensed that they were being deceived and lied to.

159
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,420
 And they, they, they didn't, they really didn't want to, they didn't want to hear it.

160
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,580
 You know, and so, so it's actually when somebody tells you that and you're really convinced,

161
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,500
 otherwise it's hard to believe it.

162
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,020
 But Jeremiah is speaking into this lie and speaking of this deception.

163
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,820
 Now this makes me wonder, what are some of those lies and deceptions and these false

164
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,940
 prophecies that are floating around in Hong Kong?

165
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,660
 And who are the people distributing these lies?

166
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,660
 Is it press?

167
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,860
 Is it social media?

168
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,100
 Is it leaders?

169
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,140
 Now while I couldn't identify a false prophecy or something that's floating around in Hong

170
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,740
 Kong, there is something that I've picked up.

171
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,620
 There's something that's been discussed among friends.

172
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,980
 And that I'm sure you've also heard.

173
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,100
 And so, and that's this idea that I'm not going to invest myself here.

174
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,980
 As a matter of fact, maybe I'm trying to sell my flat.

175
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,980
 I'm putting money outside of Hong Kong.

176
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,260
 I'm putting there a nest, you know, so I can be in case I need to leave, I can leave.

177
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,420
 So I have plan B. I am not very hopeful about the future of Hong Kong.

178
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,740
 Economically, it's not going good.

179
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,100
 Spiritually, it's not going good.

180
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,500
 And now, I'm not even saying that, you know, that is not true.

181
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 So I just want to be very clear.

182
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,100
 I'm not saying this is a false prophecy or something, because it's not a prophecy.

183
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,420
 But this is a conversation you hear a lot.

184
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,100
 And people are talking about, should we stay?

185
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
 Should we go?

186
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,860
 When are we leaving?

187
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,980
 Or maybe I want to leave, but I can't, because I need to take care of my mom, you know, or

188
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,660
 whatever it is.

189
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,980
 And so there's these questions floating around.

190
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,380
 And they're weighing on us.

191
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:43,140
 And I have a sense that within that, within all of that, that there is a lie, and there

192
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,860
 is some deception.

193
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,580
 And it's that there is no hope for Hong Kong.

194
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:58,620
 And I think also another part of it is that there is fear, that there is just a level

195
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,060
 of fear and lack of hope.

196
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,920
 And even among Christians.

197
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,180
 And I, you know, one thing when we planted this church, we announced that we're planting

198
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
 a church during the pandemic.

199
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,820
 What we're doing, Ivan and I did it on a video camera.

200
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,980
 Like we couldn't even meet in person.

201
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,580
 And at that time, there was like right now, there was companies moving out, shifting their

202
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,980
 headquarters to Singapore and all of that.

203
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,240
 So we were going against the tide.

204
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,160
 But the reason why we believe that God was leading us to do this as a church was because

205
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,660
 we sense that God is saying, I'm not finished with Hong Kong.

206
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,700
 I have a plan.

207
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,820
 I have good plans and a good purpose for the city and for the people here.

208
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,660
 You know, but it's when all you hear is this other stuff, it's hard to see that it's hard

209
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,380
 to believe that.

210
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,980
 So earlier when we were praying before the service, we had the one person as they were

211
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:05,700
 praying, they had this image of somebody carrying an armor, you know, that was protected, but

212
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,620
 it was the world's armor.

213
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,300
 And the world's armor was not from God.

214
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,740
 You know, there's the armor of God in the Bible, but it was the world's armor.

215
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,300
 And the world's armor was, I'm going to take matters in my own hand.

216
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,460
 I'm going to have plan B. I'm going to put some money outside in the nest.

217
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,460
 I'm going to do this.

218
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,460
 I'm going to do that.

219
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
 And it's very fear driven.

220
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,660
 Now and again, I also want to be careful.

221
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,380
 You know, you can use your wisdom and discernment.

222
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,380
 That's right.

223
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,540
 But there is a lot of things that are very fear driven.

224
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,740
 And surely that's not the way that God wants us to make decisions.

225
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,640
 And so, and then we have the sense that God is inviting us today and throughout the series

226
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,500
 to release some of those lies and some of those fears and some of the deception to him

227
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,580
 and then to receive what he has for us.

228
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:02,980
 And I think what he has for us is faith and hope that God is not finished with Hong Kong

229
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,180
 while other people are saying he's finished and they're ready to move out.

230
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,260
 And that he has a purpose for us here.

231
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,780
 Why plant a church if God's finished with Hong Kong?

232
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,240
 He's not, you know, like you don't do that, but he's not finished.

233
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:25,360
 And so that's some of the things that we were sensing as we were preparing this message.

234
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,300
 So let's continue with the Bible passage.

235
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,860
 So into the situation where the exiles are choosing to be disengaged, because that's

236
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,940
 what like lies and deceptions, you know, from the false prophets lead to.

237
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,480
 That you disengage, you're in this in-between space.

238
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,060
 And that's where Jeremiah's letter speaks into.

239
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:51,420
 So in verse four it says this, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says to all those

240
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,300
 I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.

241
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,460
 So I want you to, so in Jeremiah 29 verse one, we didn't read that.

242
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:07,380
 It says that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon brought Israel into exile.

243
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,620
 Now here God is saying that he did it.

244
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,340
 I carried you here.

245
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,260
 And so God is working through a secular leader accomplishing his purpose.

246
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,020
 Now again, the people, that's not what they're perceiving.

247
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,500
 That's not, they're not thinking about this event as God doing this.

248
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 They're thinking something wrong is going to happen, God's going to bring them back.

249
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,980
 So they're having the wrong perspective on what's actually happening.

250
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:44,100
 And God is doing that in part, so part of it is judgment actually on Israel because

251
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,500
 they've been idolatrous, they've been unfaithful to the covenant, to God, not doing what he

252
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,880
 asked them to do and repeatedly asked them to do.

253
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,220
 And so this exile is judgment.

254
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,740
 And that's a hard pill to swallow for those.

255
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,660
 And can you imagine receiving this letter or the guy who has to deliver the letter sharing

256
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,660
 this news?

257
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,220
 Yeah, I don't want to be that guy.

258
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,900
 And so Jeremiah's shocking message continues verse five and six.

259
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:19,180
 He says, build houses and settle down, plant gardens and eat what they produce.

260
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,580
 Marry and have sons and daughters.

261
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:29,740
 So he talks about all these things and ultimately increase in number that do not decrease.

262
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,860
 So God is telling Israel to settle down and earlier in verse 10, he also told them they're

263
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,220
 going to be there 70 years.

264
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,060
 It's like, immerse yourself, be engaged, be present.

265
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,960
 And so while there's judgment, there's actually here good news.

266
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
 There's grace.

267
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,920
 And I want to highlight that a little bit more.

268
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,760
 So in the midst of this difficult situation, God is actually reaffirming his original creation

269
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,280
 promise to Israel.

270
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
 This is creation language.

271
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,140
 Let's talk about multiplying and having children.

272
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,040
 This is blessing language.

273
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,460
 This is the cultural mandate that God gives in Genesis 128 to Adam and Eve.

274
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,660
 So actually let me read this.

275
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,520
 It says here, God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number.

276
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,260
 Fill the earth and subdue it.

277
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,480
 Rule over the fish in the sea, in the birds in the sky, and over every living creature

278
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,900
 that moves on the ground.

279
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,120
 So the word that God has spoken originally in his creation, now he's speaking over Israel

280
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
 in the exile.

281
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,600
 He's saying, I have a good purpose for you.

282
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:45,560
 I'm speaking blessing over you to flourish and to thrive here in exile.

283
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,560
 And then further in verse 11, which is the famous verse, you know, the one that you always

284
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:58,080
 have in your kitchen magnets and Christian books and posters and whatever there is.

285
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,880
 God affirms that he has these good plans.

286
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,080
 He says this in verse 11, for I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to

287
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,860
 prosper you, not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

288
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:17,060
 So while there is that judgment, but God right away, his grace and his mercy and his good

289
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,340
 purposes are at work.

290
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,720
 And with this new creation, God is working something new in Israel's hearts and lives.

291
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,620
 He's doing something new in his people.

292
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,700
 Now I don't know if you think about this.

293
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,440
 So God is saying these good things, they're not happening in the promised land.

294
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,660
 He's not saying they're happening in the temple or in Jerusalem.

295
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,980
 He's saying they're happening in an exile, in exile, in a pagan city.

296
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,620
 That is where God is choosing to bless.

297
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:59,540
 That's where he has good plans for his people to prosper them.

298
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,460
 I don't know if you've ever had that experience where God does some, blesses you, does something

299
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,900
 new in an unexpected place at an unexpected time in a place you never imagined this would

300
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,380
 happen.

301
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:18,820
 That's what God is doing right here.

302
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:29,260
 He's working and unfolding his good purposes for his people.

303
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,500
 This again, I just try to put myself in the shoes of those exiles.

304
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,420
 I mean, this must be so hard to receive.

305
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,740
 The mindset that God is asking the exiles to have is contrary to the mindset that they

306
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,580
 currently hold.

307
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,720
 He's really trying to give them a different perspective on what's going on.

308
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:58,700
 He's trying to flip a switch so they can see what God is up to in this very difficult and

309
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,620
 painful and disorienting season in their lives.

310
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,860
 But why is God asking them to have this different mindset?

311
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:16,220
 Why is he wanting them to have a different perspective?

312
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,020
 It's because he wants them to be engaged.

313
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,180
 He wants them to receive this blessing and he wants to work through them.

314
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,340
 He actually has a mission and a purpose for them.

315
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,980
 Now he wants them to have a presence in that city.

316
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,900
 Now you can be somewhere and not have a presence.

317
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:41,380
 You can be in that exact same place with exact same circumstances and have a presence.

318
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,500
 As I was preparing this message, I used to be a youth pastor a long time ago, actually

319
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,540
 at the same time as Pastor John's son, Matt.

320
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,380
 And I took over a youth group that was devastated.

321
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,460
 You know, there was a conflict and everybody had left.

322
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,460
 It used to be one of the biggest youth groups in Hong Kong, in the international churches.

323
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,940
 But then there was a blow up and they were gone.

324
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,860
 So I had like the pieces.

325
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,820
 And I had two volunteers that were amazing that God brought, Karina and John.

326
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,260
 John was here as an exchange student, Chinese American, just for a semester.

327
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,020
 Karina, also Chinese American, also an exchange student here for a year.

328
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:30,980
 And I don't know about you, if you did study in university or did some other course of

329
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,140
 developing yourself, when you're young, a lot of times you just want to have fun.

330
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,460
 You're exploring a city, you're partying, you're studying, you also take that series.

331
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,500
 And that's what they could have done.

332
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,100
 But they decided to have a presence in the city.

333
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,740
 They decided to invest themselves.

334
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:55,660
 And so every Friday night and Sunday morning, also not great times for college students,

335
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,940
 they served in the youth group.

336
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,220
 And the youth loved them.

337
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,140
 And they really helped bring people up.

338
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,060
 You help bring these youth who had just gone through a difficult experience, to bring them

339
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,820
 up, to encourage them in their faith, to build them up.

340
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:20,620
 Because they chose, they had the mindset to have a presence and to be engaged in what

341
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,940
 was going on and to be available.

342
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,420
 And this is ultimately it, to be available to God.

343
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,260
 You can be unavailable or you can be available to God.

344
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,900
 And they chose to be available to God and God used them in ways they could have never

345
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,220
 planned and we couldn't plan for it.

346
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,580
 Now this is true for every one of us.

347
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,460
 We can choose to have a presence in the city at this point in time, in the places where

348
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,340
 God has placed you in.

349
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,540
 All your spheres of influence, whether it's your business, your family, your neighborhood,

350
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:57,900
 the school you're in, the finance department, whatever you do, you can choose to have a

351
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,580
 presence there and you can choose to be available to God.

352
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,100
 You can be engaged instead of being disengaged.

353
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:15,420
 And if you are engaged, God will use you.

354
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:21,300
 Now the final key piece of the mindset that God talks about in this passage is that he

355
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:28,420
 wants us to seek, he wants the exiles and us as well to seek the welfare, the prosperity,

356
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,020
 the peace of the city.

357
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,620
 So in verse 7 it says this, "Also seek the peace and prosperity of the city which I have

358
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,340
 carried you into.

359
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:46,300
 Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper."

360
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,660
 So again God emphasized that he has a purpose and he has a mission for those in exile, in

361
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,260
 a place where they didn't want to be, they didn't think there was anything for them there,

362
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,380
 but God has good plans for them there.

363
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,780
 And then he asked them to do something that's extremely hard.

364
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:13,460
 He's asking them to work towards the prosperity, to seek the prosperity, the peace of the city,

365
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,660
 but then he also asks them to pray.

366
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,780
 Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.

367
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,340
 Now that means praying for your enemy.

368
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:32,100
 They were forcefully deported to Babylon and now God is asking them to pray for them.

369
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,620
 Now Chapman is going to talk about that in the future, so I don't want to talk about

370
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:41,580
 too much, but I think part of it, why God is asking them to pray is because they cannot

371
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,300
 bring this blessing, they cannot bring this peace, this prosperity to the city, because

372
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,820
 it's God's work, but he does it through his people.

373
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,960
 And so it's also a reminder of our independence on God that ultimately it's he who works through

374
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,340
 his people to bring about those things.

375
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:06,740
 So when you pray, we're depending on God for those things.

376
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,580
 Now the word translated as peace and prosperity is actually one word in Hebrew.

377
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,340
 It's the word shalom, and shalom has a wide range of meaning.

378
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:24,780
 The reason why there is two words, they use two words because there is no English equivalent.

379
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,500
 And here's a little definition.

380
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:33,260
 Shalom means wholeness and well-being in every aspect of life, social, economic, spiritual,

381
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
 and psychological well-being.

382
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:42,100
 And God is concerned about the welfare of Babylon and all of these aspects, and he wants

383
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,980
 to bring it through his people to that city, and he also wants to do it in Israel's life

384
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,220
 as well.

385
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,500
 So every dimension of human life in society that is damaged by sin, every injustice, every

386
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,460
 economic need, and every pain is a place where God seeks to bring his wholeness through his

387
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,380
 people.

388
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,060
 So when you look around and you see people in economic need and you're a business owner

389
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:15,620
 and you create jobs, you're bringing the shalom of God.

390
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,620
 You're raising people up because now there's people who can earn an income, can take care

391
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,740
 of their family.

392
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,660
 If you see somebody who's discouraged, who is down, and you give them your ear and you

393
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,860
 care for them, you're bringing people up.

394
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:37,140
 If you see somebody, you know, there's a relationship breakdown, maybe even because of our own sin,

395
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,420
 you can help them work through whatever happened and talk about forgiveness and repentance

396
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,460
 and God's grace and love, and you can bring them up.

397
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:53,460
 And so God wants us to be people who bring everyone up, and we do it in the places where

398
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:00,740
 there's pain, where there's need, where there's brokenness.

399
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,140
 So Israel has a choice to make.

400
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:10,020
 Will they continue to be withdrawn and disengaged in the exile, or are they going to step forward

401
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:19,700
 in faith, believe what God says, and be present, be engaged, and seek the prosperity and the

402
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,140
 peace of everyone around them?

403
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,040
 That's their choice.

404
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,020
 And that's what they ultimately did choose.

405
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,340
 But now what about us here in Hong Kong?

406
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,900
 How does all this apply to us?

407
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,860
 Now I already made connections while we're talking, but I want to just highlight a couple

408
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,340
 more things.

409
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,520
 It's interesting that in the New Testament, the Apostle Peter actually describes the church's

410
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,660
 identity through the image of exile.

411
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,940
 So if you read 1 Peter, he uses that image to describe who we are as Christians, our

412
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,120
 identity as a church.

413
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,340
 So in 1 Peter 2, 11 through 12, it says this, "Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners in

414
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,580
 exile to abstain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.

415
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:12,700
 Live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they

416
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:20,420
 may see your good deeds and glorify God in the day he visits us."

417
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,340
 So God uses this image for us.

418
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:35,380
 And what this means for us is that we're meant to be distinct, so we're meant to be holy.

419
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,140
 We're meant to reflect the character of God and the places God has us, and we're meant

420
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,580
 to be engaged.

421
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,940
 We're meant to live lives in such a way and do good works that end up leading others to

422
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,800
 glorifying God, to praising God.

423
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,580
 So the church which is you and me is meant to be an alternative community that reflects

424
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,900
 and gives expression to the character of God in the community God has placed us in.

425
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,660
 There's no accident that we're here.

426
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,620
 He has us where he wants us.

427
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:14,300
 We are called to be present and engaged and seek the welfare of the city, so much so that

428
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,620
 our good deeds become visible to those around us, leading them to glorify God.

429
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,780
 So God is calling us to live in that tension of being distinct, so we're not meant to assimilate

430
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,900
 what Babylon wanted, so that we just become like culture, that we worship the same idols

431
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,820
 as culture, money, sex, power.

432
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,260
 So we're meant to be holy, we're meant to be distinct, but then we're also meant to

433
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,460
 be engaged with what's going on.

434
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
 We are meant to be present.

435
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:52,020
 We're meant to be doing good works that bring others up.

436
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:59,020
 And when we do that, we're available for God to use us and to bring about the prosperity

437
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,860
 and the peace of those around us.

438
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,180
 You know, then we're vessels, we're people that are available to God and for his work.

439
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,580
 We're open to being his kingdom agents in the places he has placed us in.

440
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:21,300
 So we're faced with the same choice that the exiles faced.

441
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,140
 Are we going to withdraw?

442
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,700
 Are we going to assimilate?

443
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:33,100
 Are we going to walk in that tension of being distinct, but engaged and present and available

444
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,180
 to God?

445
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:41,580
 Are we going to live in fear because of the conversations that are floating around?

446
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:48,820
 Or are we going to step out in faith and believe that God has good purposes for Hong Kong and

447
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:55,180
 he wants to do good things and bring blessing through his people, through his church, in

448
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,700
 the places where he has placed us?

449
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,540
 So that's our choice.

450
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
 What's our mindset?

451
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,260
 Are we available to God or are we not available to him?

452
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,900
 So I want to invite everyone to stand right now.

453
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,060
 I also want to invite the worship team to come up.

454
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:23,500
 And I just want to give a moment for you to quietly pray on your own, to respond to what

455
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,580
 I just shared.

456
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,260
 Maybe there has been fear.

457
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,180
 Maybe there has been, you know, you're overwhelmed and there's been hopelessness.

458
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,220
 If that's the case, I want to encourage you to bring that to God.

459
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:45,660
 I want to encourage you to release that to God and ask him to give you faith and hope.

460
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,020
 Or maybe you realize that you haven't been available to God, that you've been disengaged.

461
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,900
 Right now is also an opportunity to say, "Lord, I'm available to you.

462
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,780
 I'm available to you."

463
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:08,460
 Don't underestimate what God can do through you when you are available to him.

464
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,900
 Don't underestimate it.

465
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
 You are significant.

466
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:29,540
 So Jesus, I thank you for every single person that is here.

467
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:36,460
 Lord, we lift up those things that bring us fear.

468
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,940
 We lift up those things that have discouraged us.

469
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:46,020
 We lift up our maybe we're hopelessness in us.

470
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:55,620
 We lift up those things where we have disengaged and we've just been in this limbo and haven't

471
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,620
 been present to you and present to those around us.

472
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:07,300
 Lord, I pray that this year and the spheres that you place us in, that we would be available

473
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:14,860
 to you, that we'd be led by your spirit, that you would bring your kingdom, that would break

474
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:21,540
 into the areas where we're at work, where there's pain, that you bring healing, where

475
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:28,700
 there's lack of hope, that we can be people who speak hope, where there's people who don't

476
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,260
 know about your forgiveness enough, that we can share the good news about your forgiveness

477
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,620
 enough so they can have freedom and peace and just a new life in you.

478
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,620
 Where there's people who need a job, that we can be people who create jobs for others,

479
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,140
 that we can just be people who bring others up.

480
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,900
 And we don't do it out of our own strength, we do it by your strength, by your spirit,

481
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
