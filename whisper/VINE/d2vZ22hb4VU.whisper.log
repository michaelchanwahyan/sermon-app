[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080]   Amen.
[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.720]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.700]   That was beautiful.
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.400]   Let's go.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920]   Wow, okay.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.600]   You can say hello to the person next to you.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.380]   You know, it might be someone new.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.920]   If you're online, hi.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.000]   Good to see you as well.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.120]   If you have some space next to you, let our host know.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.200]   So if there's people outside who still need to come in,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.640]   there might be a few seats scattered around.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.800]   So host, if you see any hands being held up,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.240]   out overflow people, welcome as well.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960]   If you still wanna come in, there might be a few seats.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   Excuse me, dotted around here and there.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.900]   And so, yeah, welcome.
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.920]   All right, well, it's always an honor to be here
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   sharing God's word with my church family.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.640]   And today we come to the end
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.560]   of our Uncharted sermon series.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.420]   You know, it's funny to think,
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.400]   who would have thought that God would work through
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.280]   a broken phone that Andrew had, right,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.940]   to the journey that we've had in these past few weeks,
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.560]   walking through the season of being called
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.980]   into the Uncharted.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.760]   Let me just give you a quick reminder
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.040]   of the different things that we've talked about
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.600]   in this journey so far.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.640]   We started off by being encouraged in obedience to God.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.920]   If there's one word, maybe,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.980]   that summarizes everything so far,
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.240]   I think obedience might be quite a good one.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.560]   But we're reminded at the start of this journey
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.240]   that there will be no map, right?
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.160]   There's no strategy, there's no map.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.120]   We're going into areas and places and doing things
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.300]   that we've never done before.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.100]   So of course there can't be a plan for it,
[00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.260]   but we are in response, in obedience
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.200]   to what God has called us to do.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.100]   Even if it's not comfortable,
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.840]   we were challenged to go and to obey.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.600]   And then we talked about shifting our perspective
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.880]   to the way we think, right,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.740]   to put on God's perspective,
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.860]   to think about things from a kingdom,
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.160]   of a heavenly perspective,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.460]   instead of using our earthly human wisdom
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.800]   to judge why we do things.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.980]   As we go on this journey,
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.740]   we're also reminded of the likelihood
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.820]   of facing persecution,
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.380]   and the very real persecution
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.080]   that some of our brothers and sisters
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.340]   in different places of the world are facing today.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.420]   And the challenge there was,
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.100]   when we do face persecution,
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.520]   not to shrink back, not to shy away,
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.420]   maybe not even to pray for God to help you escape from it,
[00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.940]   but to stay faithful and allow God to work through you,
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.760]   even in times of persecution.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.100]   And then we were also told, and similarly, right,
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.500]   that sometimes God will indeed call us
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.540]   into those really hard places,
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.820]   call us to do things that don't make sense
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.220]   from the worldly perspective,
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.280]   put us in difficult positions
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.580]   where we have to respond in faith and in obedience.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.100]   But God works through those things
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.940]   and uses us in those ways
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.640]   to show his power and his glory and his wisdom.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.740]   Lastly, we talked about that
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.080]   God also works through the consistent faithfulness
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.100]   of his people.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.820]   And it's not always going to be a big,
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.980]   amazing fireworks display of God's power at work,
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.260]   but often it's through the quiet,
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.060]   consistent faithfulness of his people.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.420]   Again, just being obedient,
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.500]   being doing what God has called them to do,
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.280]   welcoming those God has called them to welcome,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.820]   that his love and his power is at work.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.700]   And today, as we close out the series,
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.740]   the theme we are talking about,
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.260]   the theme we're exploring is evangelism.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.340]   Because yes, as we head into the uncharted,
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.700]   we might be doing all those things.
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   We don't know where we're going,
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.300]   we don't have a plan of action,
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.580]   it's gonna be difficult.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.020]   But the one thing we do know is who we're doing it for.
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.620]   This isn't a call to adventure
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.080]   like we were like Galilee or somewhere like that,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.620]   going off into the uncharted,
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.060]   not knowing where we're gonna end up
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.380]   for our own purposes, right?
[00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.360]   That's not what this is about.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.060]   Going into the uncharted has always been about
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.060]   going in the name of Jesus.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.760]   We're not going for the sake of adventure,
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.640]   for our own name and our own fame.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.620]   We're going to make known who Jesus is, right?
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.940]   To declare the gospel where it still needs to be heard,
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.680]   to teach and to make disciples,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.340]   to testify near and far about who Jesus is.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.700]   This is our mission.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.840]   This has always been the mission of the church,
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.000]   of the people of God.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.260]   Right, why else, right?
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.200]   Two things that Jesus said
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.800]   before he ascended into heaven, after his resurrection.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.600]   Two main things he said was this.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.240]   Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.120]   baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.640]   of the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.920]   and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you,
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.380]   and surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.020]   Matthew 28, 19.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.460]   Another version of this.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.780]   In Acts 1, 8, it says this.
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.820]   But you will receive, what, power
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.540]   when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.980]   and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.380]   and in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.620]   So the scriptures are clear.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.480]   For those of us who believe in Jesus,
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.660]   we have been told, we have been instructed,
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.100]   mandated, commanded even,
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.100]   to go and tell and teach and preach about Jesus.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.340]   This is what I mean when we say evangelism.
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.580]   And this is something that every single Christian
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.460]   is called to be a part of.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.300]   Now, but if we're honest, evangelism is one of those things
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.700]   that is sort of difficult and awkward to do, right?
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.980]   Let me tell you about one particular attempt of mine
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.540]   to evangelize, and you might be able to relate, all right?
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.540]   So I love talking to taxi drivers,
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.700]   and you might think that's kind of weird, right?
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.500]   I love talking to taxi drivers, Uber drivers, whatever it is.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.700]   I just love talking in general, I guess, right?
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.180]   But taxi drivers are amazing, right?
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.060]   I know in some countries you can call an Uber
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.860]   and you can request, right, like, don't chat to me, right?
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.820]   You're missing out, okay, if you don't talk to your driver.
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.260]   I think taxi drivers are the quintessential Hong Kong uncles,
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.860]   right, especially the ones in their 60s, okay, yeah.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.460]   [audience laughing]
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.220]   That is, yeah, okay.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.060]   Right, you know, but they're like
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.380]   the quintessential Hong Kong man, okay?
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.340]   You get in the taxi, it smells like newspapers
[00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.660]   and cigarettes, right?
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.420]   Every single sentence that comes out of their mouth
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.020]   has to have a curse word, right?
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.020]   It doesn't matter what they're talking about,
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.060]   and it's not even swearing to them, right?
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.060]   It's just the way they talk, right?
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.140]   It's just, you know, the way they express themselves.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.380]   And they'll talk about anything, right?
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.100]   They love talking about how, you know,
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.540]   [speaking in foreign language]
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.540]   You know, all this kind of stuff,
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.420]   like Hong Kong wasn't like it used to be.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.740]   You know, you young people, you're so blessed,
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.420]   or you don't know what you're doing,
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.100]   all these kind of life advice, you know,
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.860]   this is how you raise your children.
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.740]   You know, they love to talk about politics
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.780]   and where you sit and the whole spectrum of politics.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.340]   Anything they love to talk about, even religion.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.340]   So for me, sometimes when I get into a taxi,
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.940]   I see it as the perfect time to evangelize,
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.540]   because you have a captive audience, right?
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.420]   Like, you're not going anywhere, he's not going anywhere,
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.580]   okay, and you have to pay them in the end.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.500]   They're waiting for your money, and so, you know,
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.220]   what else are you gonna do with that conversation?
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.420]   And so one time I was with, this is quite a few years ago,
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.460]   I was with, I used to have lots of missionary friends
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.580]   that would come over to Hong Kong and do missionary work.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.700]   So this guy was even more zealous, like so on fire
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.820]   for telling people about Jesus.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.180]   Big, you know, Southern American guy,
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.380]   he's probably about like six foot five, you know.
[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.180]   Imagine, I'm not sure if you're gonna get this reference,
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.180]   but Stone Cold Steve Austin, okay,
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.380]   he's like a big wrestler dude,
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.460]   looks like he could be a biker gang,
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.700]   like full of tattoos, right?
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.140]   In another life, he might have been like a gang leader
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.100]   or a wrestler or something, and not that wrestling's bad,
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.860]   okay, but like something like that, like a bad person, okay?
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.740]   But this guy loved Jesus
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.660]   and loved telling other people about Jesus.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.620]   And so we got into the taxi and he was like,
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.700]   okay, let's talk to Jesus about this,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.420]   to Jesus about this, okay, yeah, okay, let's do it.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.060]   And so, but he said, okay, translate for me.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.580]   So okay, I'll be a translator,
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.820]   and he went with a classic question.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.660]   He said, okay, tell him this, if you die today,
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.940]   where do you think you'd end up?
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.780]   I was like, oh.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.380]   That's such a wild place to start a conversation, right?
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.500]   Like, I was like, are you sure, man?
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.340]   He said, okay.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.500]   So I said to the taxi, okay,
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.700]   reluctantly a little bit, I said to the taxi driver,
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.700]   I said, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.820]   I just translated for him.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.980]   And so the way his face changed was like,
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.540]   like he thought he was about to be robbed
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.100]   'cause he said to me, he's like,
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.740]   true story, true story, okay.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.740]   He said to me, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.900]   He said, don't do anything stupid.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.220]   Tell your friend not to do anything stupid.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.380]   I just started, I have no money, okay.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.140]   So I had to explain, no, we're not,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.940]   this isn't what this is about, okay, calm down, okay.
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.380]   We're here to give you life, actually, right, so.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.860]   But how about you, okay?
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.700]   In your attempt to evangelize,
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.540]   maybe it's something you've tried before,
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.460]   maybe it's something you've never tried this before
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.140]   precisely because your fear of getting yourselves
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.980]   in those sort of situations where it's awkward, it's weird.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.180]   You might get scared, you might get nervous,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.020]   you're not sure how the other person's gonna respond.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.220]   And we live with this underlying guilt sometimes, right.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.900]   We know this is something we're supposed to do,
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.180]   but we don't do it.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.160]   But evangelism is something that we are meant to do,
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.060]   like we're saying.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.220]   But I often feel like we're not doing a good enough job.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.100]   But today I hope we're gonna be encouraged in this, okay.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.580]   Because evangelism is something, like I said,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.820]   for every single person who claims to be a Christian
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.100]   to take part in, to actively do in their lives.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.420]   We're gonna look through the book of Acts
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.980]   and see what the passage has to say about evangelism.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.220]   So as the book of Acts begins, right,
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.760]   we see that the disciples,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.040]   the world has just been turned upside down, right.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.820]   They've seen their best friend, their mentor,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.620]   their teacher, their savior, dying across.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.020]   And then miraculously, through the power of God,
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.340]   he resurrects back to life.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.060]   He spends about 40 days with them,
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.680]   walking, teaching, eating, hanging out again,
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.340]   before going back into heaven.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.980]   And like I said, before going back into heaven,
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   he leaves them with this gigantic task
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.280]   of telling the whole world about him.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.580]   And then he just, poof, disappears into the sky,
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.880]   right, quite literally.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.300]   Now at this point, they're probably wondering,
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.820]   and understandably, right, a little bit nervous as well,
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.220]   like how on earth are we supposed to do this?
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.060]   Or what's the plan, what's the strategy?
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.820]   And at this moment, they don't know.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.900]   They don't really have one.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.300]   So they go back to the one thing they do know what to do,
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.300]   and that is to gather together and to pray and to wait,
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.660]   just like Emma was encouraging us
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.240]   and Jethro was encouraging us to do just now.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.020]   Acts 1:4 tells us this.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.380]   They all, that is all the disciples,
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.600]   joined together constantly in prayer
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.320]   along with the woman and Mary,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.100]   the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.700]   So everybody who was following Jesus at the time,
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.500]   right, were gathered consistently,
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.120]   constantly in prayer together.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.100]   And in our journey of evangelism,
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.020]   this passage reminded me of this, right,
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.140]   it has to start with prayer.
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.940]   Right, they had no idea what all was about to happen.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.260]   Right, they didn't know how to complete this task
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.620]   that Jesus had given to them,
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.340]   to witness to the ends of the earth.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.660]   But the one thing they did know that they could do
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.500]   whilst figuring all this out was to pray.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.940]   You know, and often in evangelism,
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.340]   we immediately, right, we think of all these plans
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.380]   and tactics and strategies to win souls for Jesus, right?
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.660]   I've seen them all, and maybe you've seen them too.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.460]   The Evanger Cube, any of you ever had an Avenger Cube?
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.540]   Right, there was this thing where you would manipulate,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.740]   just like a Rubik's Cube, and you keep flipping it,
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.700]   and each picture tells a different version
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.100]   of the gospel story.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.620]   Or maybe if you grew up in youth group,
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.860]   you made one of those bracelets,
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.180]   with like the red, some people are nodding, right,
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.060]   the red, the yellow, the black, the green,
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.260]   I can't remember the order,
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.300]   and each bead tells a different story about the gospel.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.900]   Someone taught me this, it didn't work at all,
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.900]   but for many years as a teenager,
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.740]   I walked around with a,
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.980]   with tied to empty water bottle
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.060]   hanging off the back of my backpack, right?
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.260]   And the idea was that people would see,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.100]   that's kind of weird,
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.580]   like why do you have a water bottle
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.180]   hanging off the back of your backpack?
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.900]   And then I would evangelize them, right?
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.020]   Like I'd be like, well you see this bottle's empty, right?
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.140]   Well let me tell you about living water
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.220]   that could fill this up, you know,
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.120]   it's like so cheesy, right, like it never worked, okay?
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.940]   So do these things kind of work?
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.220]   Okay, I mean, yes, sometimes, maybe not really,
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.340]   and I'm not saying there's no tactics
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.380]   and there's no ways to learn how to evangelize,
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.100]   we'll talk about that a little bit more.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.020]   But the point is this, right?
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.540]   Before we go to tools and tactics
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.940]   and all this kind of stuff,
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.260]   we need to start with prayer.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.660]   So my first question for us this morning is this,
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.700]   are we praying?
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.200]   Are we gathering and devoting ourselves to prayer
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.820]   as the disciples were?
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.260]   Whilst we wait on God,
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.780]   are we actively listening to what he wants to say to us?
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.660]   And the best way to do that is through prayer.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.060]   We pray for ourselves, for our courage,
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.820]   we pray for opportunities to present the gospel,
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.140]   we pray for the wisdom to know what to say
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.420]   when the opportunity presents itself.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.620]   This is a reminder for us,
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.260]   it's not just evangelism actually,
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.700]   anything we do, but especially with evangelism,
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.620]   has to start with prayer.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.420]   And we see what happens.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.020]   It's precisely during one of these prayer times
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.340]   that we're gathered together,
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.420]   praying together in one place,
[00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.620]   that suddenly one of the most spectacular things
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.580]   we see in all through scripture happens.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.020]   It tells us this,
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.460]   when the day of Pentecost came,
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.580]   they were all together in one place,
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.100]   presumably praying.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.500]   Suddenly, a sound like the blowing of a violent wind
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.180]   came from heaven and filled the whole house
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.080]   where they were sitting.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.980]   So just imagine the scene, right?
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.100]   You're sitting there, you're gathered with your friends,
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.740]   brothers and sisters, you're praying,
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.660]   and suddenly this loud swooshing sound
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.700]   just moves through the room, unmistakable.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.700]   Everybody hears it.
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.820]   Right, it's like when we've been sat in buildings
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.580]   or maybe in your classroom, maybe at home,
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.620]   and there's a typhoon eight blowing outside,
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.560]   you can hear the wind just blowing through your doors,
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.060]   the windows are rattling, the doors are shaking,
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.140]   it's unmistakable what's happening.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.180]   There's a huge sound of this wind
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.780]   that blows through this room.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.740]   But this wasn't a typhoon, right?
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.780]   It wasn't an ordinary wind.
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.420]   Did you catch what Luke tells us?
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.620]   Okay, check it out, listen to this again.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.300]   This was a wind that came from where?
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.180]   A blowing, a violent wind that came from heaven.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.220]   Right, this was God at work.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.180]   Just like when the Israelites were about to cross the Red Sea
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.060]   and the Lord drove the sea back to reveal dry land,
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.260]   what did he use?
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.200]   A strong east wind to guide his people into freedom.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.120]   And what I think God's trying to say here is this,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.440]   that through the wind of the Holy Spirit now,
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.080]   I'm gonna drive back your fears,
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.480]   I'm gonna drive back your worries,
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   I'm gonna open up a new way
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.680]   for you to lead people into freedom.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.640]   The Holy Spirit is here and everything is about to change.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.860]   Now the wind, of course, was just part one.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:36.760]   Because watch this, right?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.800]   Then pay attention to what God does next.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.360]   And then they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   that separated and came to rest on each of them.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.160]   All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.360]   and they began to speak in other tongues
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.560]   as the Spirit enabled them.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.000]   And when we get to passages like this,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.600]   I know, you know, maybe my imagination goes to,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.920]   what does this actually look like?
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.960]   Like tongues of fire, was it like little candle wicks,
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.640]   flames like sitting on people's heads, right?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.680]   That's the kind of image I get in my head.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.760]   But again, it's a representation of God's presence.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.760]   Think back in scripture when fire shows up,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.360]   especially in the Exodus story,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.840]   Moses and the burning bush, right?
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.360]   The way that God used fire to guide the Israelites
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.580]   by a pillar of fire through the night
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.800]   when they were in the wilderness,
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.560]   giving them warmth and light
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.120]   as they were going through into the promised land.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.440]   When they reached Sinai, it says,
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   God descended on the mountain in a great fire.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   Again, it's a confirmation of God's presence.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   And it sounds weird, it sounds undescribable
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.520]   because it precisely is undescribable, right?
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.040]   This is human words trying to describe
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.000]   a supernatural occurrence.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.520]   But the point is, it's undoubtedly the presence of God
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   showing up in a very clear and obvious way, wind and fire.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.280]   If our first step of evangelism is prayer,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.440]   the second step is we have to be empowered
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.720]   by the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   Wind and fire coming together, sweeping through the place.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.680]   Have you ever been filled with the Holy Spirit?
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.440]   If you received Jesus as your Savior,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.960]   you have to be filled with the Spirit,
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   to be filled with his presence.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.160]   Have you experienced the presence of God?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.760]   You know it's just resting on you like a consuming fire,
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.680]   burning away everything else, burning away anything
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.040]   that's not of him.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.920]   The wind of the Holy Spirit filling you up afresh
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.600]   and anew, just like what we're singing about just now.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.080]   We see that when we've been soaked in prayer,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.320]   there's about to be a movement that happens
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.680]   that will not be stopped, that has not stopped
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.240]   until this very day.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.040]   The powerful forces, untamable forces of wind and fire
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.440]   working together, sweeping through the disciples' lives,
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.600]   causing them to stop this unstoppable task
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.040]   of evangelizing the world in the name of Jesus.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.960]   Look what happens next.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.960]   They were staying there in Jerusalem,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.160]   God-fearing Jews from every nation under,
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.280]   now they're staying there in Jerusalem,
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.080]   God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.480]   So this is the people from all over the world
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.960]   gathered together at Jerusalem because it was Pentecost,
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.560]   the Jewish festival of Pentecost.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.760]   And when they heard this sound,
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.920]   this sound that the disciples heard just now,
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.880]   a crowd came together in bewilderment
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.560]   because each one heard their own language being spoken.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.360]   Utterly amazed, they asked,
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.840]   aren't all these who are speaking Galileans?
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.800]   Then how is it that each of us hears
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.880]   in our own native language?
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.480]   Parthians, Medes, Elamites,
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.360]   forgive my mispronunciations here,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.240]   Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus,
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.480]   Asia, Pharisia, Pamphylia, Egypt,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.680]   the parts of Libya, Cyrene, visitors from all over Rome,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.200]   Cretans and Arabs, we hear them declaring, what?
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.880]   The wonders of God in our own tongues.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.960]   So I know sometimes it's a bit of controversy here
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.840]   as to what tongues is actually describing, right?
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.200]   Is it the ability to suddenly speak different languages
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.000]   or was it the charismatic, unintelligible,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   supernatural prayer language of tongues?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.720]   The crowd reaction suggests that they were hearing
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.380]   their own languages being spoken, right?
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.040]   So this is a supernatural miracle that's happening on.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.320]   People that don't know how to speak a language
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.200]   suddenly receive the ability to speak that language.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.040]   But that's not the main point.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.400]   What I wanna focus on is this,
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.640]   that what the disciples were saying, okay?
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.160]   It says they were what?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:54.600]   Declaring the wonders of God.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.240]   Speaking out the wonders of God,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.600]   telling the things that they have seen God do.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.900]   Now this is amazing to me, right?
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.340]   Think about it.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.260]   The very first thing that happens to prove
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.540]   that God's spirit is alive,
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.820]   the very first thing that Jesus does through his disciples
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.940]   after his life, death and resurrection ascension to heaven,
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:22.140]   was not to perform miracles in a very real way, right?
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.380]   Was not to go and heal the sick,
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.740]   was not going to feed the poor, right?
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.860]   It's not that they started a church.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.080]   The very first sign of the disciples
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.600]   being filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.180]   was that they were compelled to declare the wonders of God.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.560]   Or in other words, they began to evangelize.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.060]   They began to spread the gospel.
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:48.440]   Now do you see how important evangelism is to Jesus' heart?
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.240]   And as this happens, right?
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.340]   As this amazing thing happens, right?
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.620]   There were a few different reactions.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.200]   Some people had the reaction of this, right?
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.920]   Amazed and perplexed.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.760]   They asked one another, scripture tells us,
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.400]   "What does this mean?"
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.680]   In other words, there was a big group of people
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.440]   that were curious.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.480]   Like, "What's going on?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.920]   "We heard this sound, this wind,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.280]   "and now these people are speaking to us in languages
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.040]   "that they should not be able to speak."
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.500]   They came to find out more.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.840]   And you will find as you go on your journey of evangelizing,
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.900]   of telling people about the gospel,
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.600]   when the gospel is proclaimed,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.680]   it does often pique curiosity.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.120]   I think back when Jesus was teaching,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.280]   huge crowds would gather, right?
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.560]   They would gather to come and listen to his parables,
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.760]   to his teaching, and they would be left thinking,
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.680]   "Who is this guy?
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.360]   "He teaches with such authority.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.280]   "What do these parables mean?
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.700]   "This person is different, the way he speaks,
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.660]   "this message is like nothing I've ever heard.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.640]   "We can't stop listening to it."
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.080]   However, at the same time, the scriptures also told us
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.000]   that some people made fun of them and said,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.920]   "They've had too much wine."
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.160]   Now, I'm not sure if you've ever talked to someone
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.280]   who's had too much wine,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.240]   probably not because we're good Christian people here.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.880]   We've never been around people like that,
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.600]   but I've heard that when people have too much wine,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.560]   they start talking in ways that don't make sense.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.200]   And this is also gonna happen when you start to evangelize.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.080]   There's gonna be people who laugh at us and sneer at us,
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.480]   and some people who will say things like,
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.080]   "This doesn't make sense.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.820]   "You sound like a drunk person talking here, right?
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.960]   "This is just the blabbering of a drunken person."
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.360]   Maybe you've heard some of this before,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.120]   as you've had some of these responses before, right?
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.640]   You believe in this nonsense?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.000]   You really think a virgin could give birth to a baby?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.760]   That's rubbish.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.680]   You really think someone who was dead can be resurrected?
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.220]   You really believe out of all the powers out there
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.960]   that there's only one God?
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.760]   You really think that sex is something for marriage?
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.480]   You know, it's not just for relationships?
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.640]   You believe in this Bible that was written 2,000 years ago?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.320]   Doesn't it contradict itself?
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.600]   It makes no sense?
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.120]   You believe in all that stuff?
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.480]   And yes, the accusation will be that the Christian message
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.060]   sounds like the ridiculous rants of a drunk.
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.140]   The first point of evangelism is we need to start with prayer
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.620]   and the second thing is we need to go with the power
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.060]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.900]   The third thing that we've been saying
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.380]   is that we need to expect opposition.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.000]   But look at how it happens.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.660]   What will our reaction be is the question.
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:42.620]   'Cause when Peter faces all these accusations, right?
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.100]   Now, he could have done a few things.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.180]   He could have toned it down to,
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.220]   "Actually, you know what, yeah, it's a bit much.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.020]   "Okay, come on, guys, let's come and gather back,
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.260]   "let's keep praying and let's not cause too much trouble."
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.520]   And maybe that's what we wanna do as well.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.540]   "Okay, yeah, I'll just shut up about it
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.060]   "and I'm not gonna talk about it anymore."
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.380]   Or maybe we change the message to make it a bit more
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.900]   acceptable, a bit more palatable to the people
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.060]   that we're talking to.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.420]   But that's not the kind of people we wanna be, right?
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.860]   That waters down the truth.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.140]   That's not the type of church we've called to be.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.380]   Right, do we really wanna be the kind of Christians
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.340]   that just fold under a little bit of ridicule,
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.580]   who are afraid to speak the whole truth?
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.500]   No, church.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.620]   We wanna be the kind of followers of Jesus
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.300]   who are bold in the faith,
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.980]   willing to stand up to persecution and ridicule,
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.500]   as we were saying about in this past journey.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.700]   And this is what we see in Peter.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.660]   Right, Peter isn't scared, he isn't intimidated,
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.100]   but he stands up and raises his voice, it says,
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.300]   and begins to preach the gospel.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.380]   Right, he begins to explain who Jesus was.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.340]   What's happening actually does make sense.
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:53.660]   This is what's happening.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.020]   And he begins to talk about Jesus,
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.900]   that he was the one that was sent from God
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.480]   through his signs and miracles that Jesus performed
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.180]   that proved this, that he was put to death on the cross.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.580]   But then listen, let's go back to scripture.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.460]   But God raised him from the dead,
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.380]   freeing him from the agony of death,
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.500]   because it was impossible for death to keep a hold on him.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.260]   And now God has raised this Jesus to life,
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.900]   and we were all witnesses of it.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.420]   Exalted to the right hand of God,
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.020]   he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.460]   and has poured out what you now see and hear,
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.020]   that Jesus is both Lord and Messiah over all people,
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.860]   and everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.580]   will be saved.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.160]   He doesn't hold back.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.620]   He boldly declares what is happening,
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.140]   who Jesus is, what he was, that he came to this earth to do,
[00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.560]   and you, Christian, have been called to do the same.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.820]   If you're sitting here right now listening to this story,
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.660]   if you call yourself a follower of Jesus,
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.020]   the gospel is something that you've already received,
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.940]   you've already experienced.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.900]   You know this story because you're living in it right now.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.860]   But since we're talking about it, the gospel,
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.900]   just in case there's someone here right now listening
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.020]   who hasn't heard the gospel, maybe you're listening online,
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.940]   maybe a friend brought you to church today,
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.220]   and maybe for all the rest of us, it's just a reminder.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.900]   What is this story?
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.980]   What is this amazing thing that we're talking about?
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.580]   Well, the gospel starts with recognizing
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.540]   that there is one God.
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.540]   This is the God who created the heavens and the earth,
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.580]   who sung every star and planet in the sky,
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.680]   yet he knows you by name.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.200]   Because he created you.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   He created us, human beings, in love, in his image.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.800]   And the Bible tells us he breathed his life into our lungs.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.360]   And when he created this earth, everything was perfect,
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.800]   because our God is perfect.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.360]   But we messed it up.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.320]   We rebelled against God, we sinned against him,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.760]   and into his perfect creation, we brought sin.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.280]   And sin is this horrible mess that just keeps getting worse.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   The more we try to clean it up ourselves,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.000]   the more we try to fix it, the worse it becomes.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.200]   And sin is what binds us in darkness.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.360]   Sin is what makes us commit and think evil thoughts.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.320]   Sin is what brings death.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.880]   Sin is what has now separated us
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   from this God who created us.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.560]   But yet, he loved us.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.680]   And he loved us so much,
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.560]   he refused to let us sit in sin and darkness.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.880]   And so he begins this rescue plan to try to save us.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   And in this rescue plan, he sends his beloved son, Jesus.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.260]   And Jesus comes down to earth to live amongst us.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.620]   And Jesus is God, we know this,
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.160]   because whilst he was on this earth, as Peter was saying,
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.420]   he proved it time and time again
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.640]   in the way he taught with authority,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.320]   in the way he loved people,
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.160]   in the signs and wonders that he performed.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.680]   He proved it in fulfilling the many prophecies
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.280]   that the Old Testament proclaimed.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.400]   And ultimately, he proved it to us
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   by dying on the cross for our sins, paying that price.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.120]   Not because we did anything to earn it,
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.040]   not because we did enough good things
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.720]   to capture his attention,
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.040]   not because we fixed ourselves up first.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.960]   This was not our idea or our doing.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.360]   This is because of the love that he had for us.
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:41.160]   But even death could not hold Jesus down.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.960]   And after three days in the tomb,
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.920]   God raised Jesus back to life,
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.960]   defeating the powers of sin and darkness once and for all,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.760]   establishing his rightful place as king
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.800]   over the entire universe, reconciling us with God,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.200]   confirming that Jesus is indeed the Messiah and Savior
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.480]   the world is longing for.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.920]   And to this day, if you call on the name of Jesus
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.520]   and Jesus alone, if you accept him as your Savior,
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.400]   you too will be saved.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.760]   Right, this is the greatest story in history,
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.000]   the greatest story that's ever been told.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.640]   This is why the meaning of what gospel is, right?
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.080]   This is why it's called the good news.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.600]   And like I said, if you and I listening to this right now,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.960]   for those of us who've already lived it,
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.880]   you've accept this, you believe this, right?
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.680]   You felt the love of God.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.120]   You felt the Holy Spirit working inside of you.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.480]   You are aware of how he saved you from your sin.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.040]   You're living in this new life now,
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.960]   reconciled with God, being able to gather
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.280]   with brothers and sisters like this, right?
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.040]   Would you disagree with me that this is the best news
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.200]   that you've ever heard, that you've ever received,
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.480]   the best thing ever?
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.000]   Nobody disagrees with you in that, right?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.920]   Then brothers and sisters, if this is the case,
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.560]   why are we not telling everybody about this?
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.200]   Why are we not sharing it?
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.320]   I mean, it's not like, and I'm talking to myself here too,
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.040]   okay, it's not like we don't like to share news, right?
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.680]   Anything, social media proves to us,
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.880]   we love to share about things that happen to us, right?
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.560]   Coldplay, woohoo, yeah, she said yes, yeah.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.480]   New cookies and one try, okay?
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.160]   All these things we love to share about, right?
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.400]   We will share about everything else.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.000]   So why is it then when it comes to sharing the gospel,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.200]   which we've already agreed is the greatest story
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.000]   that's ever told, but it's also a story
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.360]   that's hardly ever told?
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:44.760]   Again, in my own reflection and in my own heart,
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.320]   there's a few reasons why I sometimes think
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.000]   we are reluctant and we keep quiet about the gospel.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.480]   First thing is this, fear.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.200]   Maybe this is the biggest one, right?
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.400]   Questions such as, like I said just now,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.840]   what are people gonna think about me?
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.480]   What if they mock me?
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.920]   I'm too religious, right?
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.880]   You're a goody two shoes, right?
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.000]   What if, I know my boss is sort of hostile
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.080]   towards Christianity, if I speak this out,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   I might not get the opportunities
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.480]   that my other colleagues might get.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.280]   But what if they discriminate against me?
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.800]   What if I start facing persecution?
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   Or maybe what if they start asking me questions
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.120]   and I don't know what I'm talking about
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.040]   and I look like a fool?
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.880]   Fear holds us, or these things,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.760]   holds us back so often when it comes
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.040]   to sharing the gospel.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:36.120]   Or maybe sometimes it's your own laziness,
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.640]   apathy, excuses, right?
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.280]   And the truth is this, again,
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.680]   I'm talking to myself here as well,
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.280]   so please don't, we're in this together, okay?
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.560]   Sometimes I feel like we don't care enough.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.120]   And we give ourselves excuses like,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.020]   oh, I'm not that good with words.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.440]   It's not my gifting.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.640]   If I don't say it, someone else will share with them.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.160]   I don't have the time to do that right now.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.560]   All these things, I'm just gonna wait
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.560]   for a better opportunity.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.960]   And we get lazy and we prioritize other things
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.440]   over sharing the gospel.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.280]   And perhaps sometimes it's forgetfulness.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.680]   And we forget that we too were once in that place
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.320]   when we were without hope,
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.720]   where we were sitting in our sin,
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.880]   wondering what to do with ourselves.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.840]   And we forget that if it wasn't for someone else
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.600]   who come and spoke and preached
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.760]   and taught us about the gospel,
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.040]   no matter who it could have been,
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.840]   could have been a grandmother, a parent,
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.600]   a teacher, a friend, whoever it was,
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.120]   that we would have never heard the gospel
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.280]   in the first place, and maybe we wouldn't be living
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.960]   the lives in Jesus, experiencing the love
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.080]   that we do in this moment.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:47.760]   And our minds aren't tuned to those
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.200]   who are still lost in the darkness.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.440]   We forget about that.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.080]   And if we're honest with ourselves,
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.640]   it's probably a mixture of all these three things
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.960]   coming together.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:03.160]   But what I'm challenging us today, church, is this, right?
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.160]   It's not good enough.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.520]   And if we've been called to go into the uncharted
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.800]   like we have at the beginning of this journey,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.440]   we have been commissioned and commanded
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.520]   into these unknown places, like I said,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.200]   to proclaim the gospel and the name of Jesus.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.720]   And Paul would say it this way, right?
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.840]   How can they call on the name of one
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.520]   they have not believed in?
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.280]   And how can they believe in one who they have not heard?
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.800]   And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.160]   And how can anyone preach to them unless they are sent?
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:37.320]   Church, what I'm saying is this, we have all been sent.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.240]   And whilst we're sitting here in this room,
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.080]   while people out there are living and dying
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.320]   without hearing and believing in Jesus,
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.240]   because we haven't done the work of evangelism
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.080]   and telling people about the gospel.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.040]   Our sermon series might come to an end today,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.880]   but the call remains on us, right?
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.800]   This is not a time to rest.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.360]   This is not a time to hold back.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.120]   This is a season that we've been talking about of action.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.600]   It's not a time to tone down.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.800]   God's desire is that the gospel, right, of his kingdom
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.520]   will be preached to the whole world.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.640]   So we cannot stop talking about this
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.640]   until every single person has heard about Jesus.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.760]   And it's not something we can be slow and lazy about,
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.280]   because a life without the gospel leads us
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   to a very dark place with some very serious consequences.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.240]   One of the consequences is this,
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.800]   eternal separation from God.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:45.960]   The consequence of not hearing and responding to the gospel
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.600]   is that when we die, we end up separated from God forever.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.800]   Again, we're just talking about real things here, okay?
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.440]   But our time on earth is gonna end in one of two ways, right?
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   Either your body stops working, which means you die,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.760]   or Jesus is gonna come back.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.360]   Either way, we have very little control
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   over those two occurrences.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.620]   I mean, all of us in this room,
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.360]   and I pray that we do wanna live lives,
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.040]   good, healthy lives until we're gold and gray, right,
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   and die peacefully in our sleep.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.960]   But nobody is guaranteed that.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.600]   And with my own eyes and my own life,
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.920]   and I'm sure you've experienced it too, right,
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.800]   life often, we call it cut short in some way.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.000]   Sickness, disease, accidents, sometimes for reasons
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   when we don't even understand, life is out of our control.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.460]   In the same way, Bible tells us no one knows
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.960]   the day or the hour when Jesus will return.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.060]   We do know he is coming back, though,
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.600]   and when he does come back again for the second time
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.940]   to save those who are eagerly awaiting him,
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.260]   and we know that when he comes back,
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.540]   he's gonna be coming back as a king
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.940]   to judge the living and the dead.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.060]   And we know when he comes back, or when we die,
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.420]   he's gonna separate those who have accepted
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.980]   and lived and praised and been walking in the gospel
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.420]   from those who have not.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.260]   And those who have lived in the gospel,
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.980]   who have accepted Jesus as a savior,
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.940]   will go off and live with him eternal life with God,
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.540]   and for the others, it's eternal separation from God
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.880]   in darkness, in punishment.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:31.000]   So that's a real consequence of responding to the gospel.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.380]   But the second thing is this, I think this might be
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.600]   even more pressing and more important right now,
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.000]   because often we focus on that, we focus on the afterlife
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.080]   when we go to the evangelism group.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.200]   Like when I said, if you die today, where you gonna go?
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.520]   But that's not the whole picture either.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.160]   Because if it was, then accepting the gospel
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.160]   is sort of like the super life insurance that you could get.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.600]   So the moment you die, you get to go to heaven.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.240]   Okay, well then, again, let's just keep it real.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.300]   If that's the case, then why not just die
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.840]   right after you receive the gospel?
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.640]   Then you get to go with me heaven straight away
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.000]   and everything will be fine.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.800]   But when we live without the gospel,
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.280]   it's not just about the afterlife,
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.360]   but it's about life here right now.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.740]   This is the beautiful thing about the gospel.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.040]   It's not just about going to heaven
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.940]   and being with God forever.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.320]   Like I said, it's not an afterlife insurance policy.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.120]   But Jesus says this, I have come to give you life
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.920]   and life in the full.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.000]   The gospel allows us to live our lives on this earth,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.840]   however long or short that might be,
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.840]   with meaning and purpose and identity and mission
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.200]   that God intended us to have.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.960]   So the gospel embodies every single part of our lives.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.000]   The gospel is why we can have hope when things seem hopeless.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.840]   The gospel is what drives us to speak up and fight back
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.320]   against the injustices we see in this world.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.520]   The gospel is what compels us to love everybody
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.120]   that we see with the love of God, even our enemies.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.040]   The gospel allows us to celebrate the joys of this life,
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.040]   but also walk with those who are going through
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.680]   the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.160]   The gospel is because, it's the reason why
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.120]   we can come together in a room like this,
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.580]   people from all over the world,
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.100]   from all different backgrounds,
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.200]   together as a family worshiping Jesus.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.160]   That is because of the gospel.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.480]   This is why we cannot stay silent.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:36.640]   Peter urges the people, "Save yourselves," he says,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.520]   "from this corrupt generation."
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.660]   And this is what we still face to this day,
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.260]   a world that is corrupt, a world that is broken,
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.480]   a world with people living in darkness and without hope
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.720]   in this world or the next.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.240]   But the gospel, church, this is the key.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.080]   This is why I keep saying we cannot be silent,
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.040]   we cannot shut up, we cannot give up, we cannot stop.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.680]   We need to preach the gospel because just two minutes,
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.720]   for a five-minute walk from here, right,
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.720]   under the bridge, there's people putting their hopes
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.960]   in the lady, slapping against a piece of paper, right?
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.120]   They're putting their hopes in that,
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.560]   engaging themselves in demonic forces.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.400]   That's where they're finding their hope,
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.960]   trying to beat your troubles away.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.040]   People need to see that that is not real hope.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.140]   True hope is found in Jesus and Jesus alone.
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.120]   We need to preach the gospel because there are kids
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.720]   and teenagers and young people struggling right now
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.360]   in Hong Kong and all over the world
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.400]   to find meaning and purpose in life.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.600]   And some have even turned to taking their own lives
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.240]   as a result.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.800]   You know, our teen suicide rates in Hong Kong
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.960]   are some of the highest amongst developed nations.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.120]   They need the gospel to know that no matter what happens,
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.560]   doesn't matter how good your grades are,
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.280]   doesn't matter what your teachers
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.560]   and your exam results tell you, right,
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.520]   that does not define you.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.560]   But you have a Father in heaven who loves you
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.640]   and values you exactly for who you are,
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.060]   not what you are doing.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.440]   We need to preach the gospel because there are couples
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.820]   struggling in their marriages, ready to give up,
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.480]   not seeing a hope in the future together.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.140]   And the gospel is what teaches them about love
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:24.140]   and reconciliation and being the church to each other.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.480]   We need to preach the gospel because some have sold
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.280]   themselves to the ways of the world,
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.840]   chasing money, status, fame, prestige, and all these things
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.040]   and reaching the mountaintops where they've literally
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.920]   acquired every single earthly thing that they want,
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.440]   still finding their lives empty,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.400]   not knowing that the only thing that will ever satisfy them
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.940]   is Jesus.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:51.560]   We need to preach the gospel because there are people
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.940]   and families just facing the everyday realities
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.760]   of what life is, right?
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.500]   The family that's facing financial issues,
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.940]   the child that just gets diagnosed with cancer,
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.820]   the father who's just lost his job and is told,
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.840]   there's no future for you in this company.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.020]   Whatever it is, we go through the everyday
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:16.600]   harsh realities of life, not knowing that
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.240]   there's a God out there who can help them,
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.700]   who can lead them, who can guide them,
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.840]   who can heal, who can provide, who can save.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.820]   For these reasons as More Church,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.420]   we need to speak the gospel.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.860]   You and me, my family in Christ,
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.840]   have been called to do this.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:40.900]   And as we do this, remember, there is great power.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.700]   You know, it's not, your job is just to speak it out,
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.620]   okay, to have the courage to do that.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.480]   But it's not up to your own power.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.480]   But when the gospel does work, it does amazing things,
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.540]   things we would never even imagine, right?
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.140]   Check out what it says, I'm continuing the passage in Acts.
[00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:02.100]   When the people heard this message,
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.540]   after they heard Peter speak,
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.940]   it told us they were cut to the heart.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.340]   In other words, they had to make a decision.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.780]   They even asked themselves the questions,
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.400]   brothers, what shall we do?
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.300]   We've heard this message, I've realized that
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.940]   now I also need this, right?
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.060]   This is God's work, this is God's,
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.080]   the power of God's word at work, right?
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.580]   Not your own power, but the gospel itself
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.760]   carries the message of Jesus.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.880]   So all you have to do is speak it out
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.280]   and wait for the Lord to move.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.100]   It's not about how convincing you are,
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.160]   but it's about how obedient you are
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.100]   in allowing God to speak through you.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:44.600]   And it tells us that 3,000 people, amazing,
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.800]   were added to the number that day.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.500]   Again, it's not about the numbers.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:54.380]   It's about us being ready to respond,
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.220]   being ready to go and speak the gospel
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.100]   to those who need it.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:04.200]   So like I said in the beginning,
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.460]   this might be uncharted and maybe now,
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.060]   you know, as we started, maybe you're feeling a bit guilty,
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.820]   maybe you've been feeling worse now, okay?
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.520]   And that's not the point, okay?
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.120]   The challenge is not to leave you feeling nervous
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.440]   and guilty because you've never done this before.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.980]   It sounds so serious now, and I'm even more scared, okay?
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.060]   I want us to be encouraging each other
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.480]   to do this together, all right?
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.780]   Let's not let us get away with letting nervousness
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.580]   and fear stop us from what we're doing.
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.820]   So I'm gonna give you a few simple things
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:33.740]   that we can start with.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.500]   Okay, these are things I truly believe, honestly,
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.180]   everybody can do, okay?
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.740]   All of us can do.
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.180]   First thing is this, okay?
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.940]   And again, I'm just gonna say it bluntly, right?
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.640]   Don't be a jerk, okay?
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.560]   Like, be a nice person.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.540]   Be the kind of person that other people
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.060]   want to have conversations with, right?
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.640]   You can't be rude and mean in one minute
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.660]   and then suddenly say, oh, let me tell you about Jesus,
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:00.080]   right, no one's gonna want to listen to that, okay?
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.360]   So just be kind, be nice, be loving, okay?
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:04.320]   Be a bit patient.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.080]   I know we Hong Kongers are often very impatient
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.040]   and rushing to place in there all the time.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.360]   Slow down, be kind, be loving, okay?
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.800]   Second thing is this, right?
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.540]   Use your testimony, right?
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.160]   If you can't remember all the details of the Bible story,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.220]   maybe one thing you can do is study up on that,
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.460]   read up on that, get yourself familiar with that.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.700]   But even without that, right, your testimony
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.020]   is the gospel at work in your life, right?
[00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.900]   So it is, in a way, preaching the gospel, right?
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.580]   And you're never gonna be confused about your own story
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.280]   because it's what happened to you, right?
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.040]   Like I said, we all have been through the experience
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.120]   of receiving the love of Jesus, right, changing our lives.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.240]   Just start with that, you know, invite that friend,
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.960]   invite that person out for coffee and say, you know what?
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.240]   I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about myself.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.600]   Let me tell you about my journey in Christianity, right?
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.840]   This is what I was before, this is where I am now, right?
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.640]   It's such a beautiful way to introduce Jesus to someone.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.900]   And third thing, like we said at the beginning,
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.940]   is to pray, right?
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.020]   Let's be praying for this church.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.060]   Let's be praying for each other, let's be praying
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.460]   for other brothers and sisters all over the world
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.860]   who are walking down this road and speak
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:26.500]   and being encouraged to speak the gospel out.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.460]   Let's be in prayer for opportunities,
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.980]   let's be in prayer for those who haven't heard
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:35.980]   the gospel yet, and together, as a body of Christ,
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.280]   we say we will not give up until all have heard
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.820]   and received the love and the gospel of Jesus.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.420]   Would you pray with me?
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:59.420]   You know, we were talking just now
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.420]   and I made an assumption that it's,
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.980]   you know, that everyone here has heard that message.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.780]   But I wanna give an opportunity right now
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.180]   to perhaps this is the first time you've ever heard
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:21.180]   that gospel story, the fact that there is a savior
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.100]   and a messiah that loves you and wants to save you
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.900]   from your sin and give you hope and life
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.140]   and life to the full.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.900]   And maybe today is the first time
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.940]   you've ever responded to that,
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:41.420]   or want to respond to that.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.300]   And so with an opportunity like this,
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.140]   I don't want it to go to waste.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:55.380]   I just wanna invite anyone who's there right now,
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.140]   if that is you, two invitations for you.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:01.980]   Right now, maybe if you just, you can just sit there
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.980]   and talk to God and just tell him, I want you, Jesus.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:12.740]   And it just starts with a very, very simple conversation
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.780]   with God, you talk to him just like you would anyone else.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:20.340]   You can do that quietly and he hears you, he knows,
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.440]   he sees everything.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.540]   But if you're willing, if you are, and if that's you,
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:31.340]   I would also invite you to perhaps get up off your seat
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:35.420]   and come forward right now so that the church
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.260]   can pray for you.
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:38.540]   Together we can celebrate this wonderful,
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:42.740]   life-changing moment, eternity-changing moment right now.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.420]   I'm just gonna throw the invitation out there.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.460]   It doesn't matter if nobody comes forward.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.140]   If you're in the upper house listening,
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.340]   you can come downstairs and come forward.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:56.000]   I'm just gonna give us a couple of seconds
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.940]   to respond to that.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.020]   So if that is you, either just respond where you are,
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.980]   that's okay, but the courageous thing to do,
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.900]   and we would love to be able to celebrate with you
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.580]   if you would come forward so we can pray for you
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:08.900]   and celebrate this together.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.660]   Is anybody out there right now with that?
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:21.660]   Or maybe online you can just let us know as well.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.240]   (gentle music)
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:32.100]   All right, that's okay.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.260]   For the rest of us, we know what we need to do.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.380]   We've always known, and today's probably just a reminder
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.500]   of the mission, the calling that God has given,
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:44.020]   the task that he's given to all of us.
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.620]   And so Jesus, we pray that you would just fill us up
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.280]   with the Holy Spirit, with courage.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.820]   Bring us to the people that need to hear your gospel.
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.500]   And just through one conversation at a time, Lord,
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:02.460]   we bring your kingdom here on this earth.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.740]   We show people that there is a God who loves them
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.700]   and offers them everything that they've ever wanted,
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.180]   everything that they needed can be found
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.540]   when we find Jesus, true meaning and purpose in life.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.380]   And everything else fades away
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.560]   when we have you in the center.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:27.420]   So Lord, help us to carry and live
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.300]   and preach this gospel with us wherever we go,
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.380]   from here to the ends of the earth.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:38.140]   Strengthen us and send us.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.580]   We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:50.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
