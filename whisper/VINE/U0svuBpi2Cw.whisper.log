[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Hey, it is so good to be with you.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.480]   It's actually the first time in two years
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.240]   that I get to preach in person and not to camera.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.880]   And I'm so thankful for that.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.280]   It's much better to do it with people in the room.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.240]   Now, recently I went to the wet market near my home.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.540]   My wife, Chris and I, we were gonna have over some friends
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.720]   for some Korean barbecue.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.240]   And I also wanted to buy some groceries for the weekend.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.160]   And yeah, so I was at the wet market.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.200]   I bought vegetables.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.480]   I bought meat.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.440]   I bought fruits.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440]   And let's just say I bought a whole lot more
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.920]   than I could comfortably carry.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.680]   Does anyone ever do that?
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.320]   Yeah?
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.320]   So I'm loaded up.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.840]   And instead of walking home, which would be 15 minutes,
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.720]   which of course I didn't do, I decided
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.960]   to take the mini bus from the wet market
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.760]   to drop me off right in front of my estate where I live.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.800]   And so I got in line with my bags.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.760]   And I'm waiting.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.400]   And it's hot.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.240]   And I'm sweating.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.000]   My arm starts hurting.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.960]   I'm shifting the bags around, holding it differently.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.200]   I'm trying to make this work.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.160]   And I'm starting to think, where is this bus?
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.520]   Where is it?
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.400]   Another 10 minutes passed.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.640]   Now we have 40, 50 people standing in line.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.040]   And I'm wondering, when is the stinking bus ever going to come?
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.440]   Now, I don't know about you, but I hate waiting.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.880]   And I especially hate it when it's hot
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.200]   and I'm carrying heavy stuff.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.360]   So truth be told, we all don't like waiting.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.200]   And if you do, you have to explain this to us, right?
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.600]   But in the big scheme of things, waiting
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.760]   for 15 minutes for a mini bus is really not that big of a deal,
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.280]   even though it was annoying.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.680]   But what about waiting on some of those bigger and more
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.640]   important things in life?
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.080]   Right now, the whole world is waiting for COVID to end.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.280]   Yes, Jesus.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.880]   Let's do this.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   Let's get this over with.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.320]   For me, recently, I tried to see if I could travel and see
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.200]   family, and it was just too complicated.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.800]   I couldn't do it.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.280]   For others of you, it might be your business
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.480]   or you're even just being concerned
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.120]   about sickness and health.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.720]   But what about waiting on other things?
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.000]   So for example, maybe you started a job
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.880]   and went down a career path.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.400]   But for one reason or another, it's just not working out.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.840]   And maybe that's something that even God put in your heart.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.960]   And you're, God, what's going on here?
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.240]   Maybe you're waiting on health for you, for a loved one.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.880]   But for whatever reason, things don't
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.120]   seem to be getting better.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.240]   So what are you waiting on right now?
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.680]   What is one of those bigger things in life
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.800]   where you are waiting for God to act?
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.760]   So there are things we're all waiting for,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.640]   for ourselves, for loved ones, for the city.
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.200]   But here's the thing.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.240]   When our circumstances don't change, when we keep waiting
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.080]   and it just continues, we start getting anxious, frustrated,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.160]   and we often lose hope and perspective.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.720]   Now, I found myself actually quite often going
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440]   through a difficult period of time.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.200]   So there was a time when for a year long,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.720]   I could not sleep well.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.800]   And I was living in fear.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.320]   Then there was another time where my dad
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.280]   was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.200]   And it was a very difficult period of waiting.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.040]   And we prayed.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.120]   And I prayed that my dad would be well again.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   But it did not happen.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.080]   And most recently, there was a time with my first wife
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.840]   where she left me and filed for divorce,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.920]   talking about a disorienting time.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.680]   And I was praying to God, God, will I ever feel whole again?
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.080]   And honestly, I struggled to trust God
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   and to believe that my life could be good again.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.160]   And there was even a point where I said, take me, Lord.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.520]   I don't care.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.040]   And then there was questions.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.480]   Why is this happening to me?
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.320]   What did I do to deserve this?
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.280]   Why is my life falling apart?
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   So these are just some of the experiences and times
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.880]   that I've gone through where it's
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.640]   been difficult to continue to have faith, where it's just
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.200]   been a painful season of waiting,
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.240]   and quite honestly, where it wasn't always easy to keep
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.920]   living the Christian life.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.880]   So what do we do in these difficult times
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.680]   when we find ourselves in them?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.320]   How can we stay connected to God in times of waiting?
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.840]   When are we-- when we are discouraged and struggle
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.560]   to hold on to our faith, what do we do?
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.440]   Sure.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.940]   All right.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.800]   So today, we're going to actually answer that question
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.840]   or look at how God wants to speak to us
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.440]   about this question.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.400]   And we're continuing in the Summer Psalms sermon series.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.840]   Last week, we heard a wonderful message
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.320]   from Pastor Carla, who shared with us about seeking
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.960]   after God's presence and desiring that.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.920]   And today, we're going to look at Psalm 37.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.120]   Now, let me give a little bit of context.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.400]   Psalm 37 is a psalm that's attributed to King David.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.200]   And David, he was a king that was no stranger to waiting.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.160]   He knew what it was to wait.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.200]   He was anointed as king.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.880]   But then there was an over 10-year period
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.360]   where nothing happened.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   And King Saul continued being the king.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.160]   And not only that, he actually was persecuted
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.760]   and had to hide in caves and stuff like that.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.880]   And so he knows what it means to wait.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.640]   And so the psalm was written to a community who
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.280]   was struggling with their life circumstances
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.800]   and waiting on God.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.920]   It's addressed to people who are on the verge of losing
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.600]   their faith, their hope in God.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:29.120]   So there is a general biblical wisdom in Psalm 1
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.840]   that says that faithful living results in well-being
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.480]   and flourishing.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.880]   That's the introduction to all of the psalms.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.640]   But what if that just doesn't seem to be happening?
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.840]   That's why Psalm 37 is written to a community of faith
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.760]   where that doesn't seem to be happening,
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.920]   but where people are walking through a season
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.320]   of disorientation, where they're just lost.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.360]   And they don't know what to do.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.120]   And they're on the brink of losing
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.400]   their hope and their way.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.920]   So I think that's something that we all
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.080]   can relate at in this time.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.240]   We've been going through a season of disorientation.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.160]   And so I think this is a word and season for us,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.880]   where God wants to speak to us about our waiting
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.640]   through his word.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:30.920]   So the psalm, it's not about addressing
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.360]   the question of suffering and the difficulty.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.960]   But instead, it provides guidance and encouragement
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.880]   on how to live when you find yourself
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.560]   hard-pressed walking through a difficult season.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.240]   And so let's look at the first nine verses in Psalm 37.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.720]   I'm going to read them to us.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.480]   Starting in verse 1, it says, "Do not
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.760]   fret because of those who are evil,
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.120]   or be envious of those who do wrong.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.720]   For like the grass, they will soon wither.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.920]   Like green plants, they will soon die away.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.520]   Trust in the Lord.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.080]   Do good.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.800]   Dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.520]   Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.920]   the desires of your heart.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.960]   Commit your way to the Lord.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.840]   Trust in him, and he will do this.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.760]   He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.360]   your vindication like the noonday sun.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.640]   Be still before the Lord, and wait patiently for him.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.920]   Do not fret when people succeed in their ways,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.960]   when they carry out their wicked schemes.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.680]   Refrain from anger and turn from wrath.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.640]   Do not fret.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.600]   It leads only to evil.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.040]   For those who are evil will be destroyed,
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.640]   but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land."
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.440]   So the psalm pictures a community
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:13.920]   at a crossroads, a crisis of faith, times of temptation,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.680]   but also a very difficult time of waiting.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.680]   So a lot of times when we think about waiting,
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.360]   we picture ourselves as being passive.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.240]   We're just waiting to get through something,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.960]   or we're waiting for those storm clouds to lift and move on
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.240]   so we're not being poured down on.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.000]   But that's not how the psalm is encouraging us.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.040]   Yes, there are circumstances where we are powerless,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.840]   that we can change, but there's still
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.200]   choices and actions that we can take,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.160]   even in the midst of these difficult seasons of waiting.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.520]   So what are some of those choices
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.080]   that we can make that the psalm wants to encourage
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.440]   us to connect with God with?
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.320]   Well, let's take a look.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.520]   The first one is in verse 3.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.120]   It says, "Trust in the Lord."
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.160]   Well, trusting in the Lord means handing over to Him
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.000]   what's going on and asking Him to take care of it
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.400]   because we can't, and to meet us in that place of need,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.200]   and just placing ourselves in His loving and caring hands.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.400]   So that's an active step that we can take,
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.040]   but we often don't take.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.000]   Well, why do we struggle to actually trust in the Lord?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.400]   What's so hard about that?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.320]   Well, here's one reason, perhaps.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.200]   A lot of times we struggle to trust in the Lord
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.840]   because we like being in control.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.800]   We like taking care of things ourselves.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.520]   We do everything possible to take care of something
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.240]   ourselves before we acknowledge, hey, I actually need help,
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.840]   let alone need help from God.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.760]   Is anyone with me on that?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.280]   Yes?
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.000]   Yeah, I do that.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.840]   So we're self-reliant.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.040]   We're prideful.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.840]   We want to take care of things ourselves.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.640]   That's one reason.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.200]   But there's other reasons as well.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.840]   So here's another one.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.600]   We struggle to trust in the Lord because we're
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.600]   fearful that when we do, we're going to be disappointed
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.520]   because perhaps we've come to God beforehand
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.320]   and entrusted something to Him.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.080]   But for one reason or another, it just
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.880]   didn't work out the way we hoped for and we're wishing.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.360]   And so we're scared to make ourselves vulnerable again
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.040]   because we don't want to get hurt again.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.600]   We struggle to trust that God is good, that He loves us,
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.680]   and that He's powerful enough to meet us and to act.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:56.600]   But despite our tendency to be self-reliant
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.520]   and wanting to take care of things on our own strength
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:06.400]   and also to be fearful to be disappointed again,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.560]   the psalm encourages us to trust in the Lord.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.240]   God wants to show you His goodness.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.760]   He wants to meet you in this difficult thing
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.920]   that you are going through, that you are facing.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:25.120]   He wants to show you His grace and His hope and His help.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.120]   And the community of faith, the Christian community,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.160]   the church, divine church, affirms that,
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.280]   the experience of the people.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.160]   And we have known this to be true.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.000]   And so we're encouraged to trust in the Lord.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.200]   So one of the ways to trust God that
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.160]   has been most helpful for me personally
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.720]   is to surrender yourself to God's care
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.960]   and entrust whatever is going on to Him through prayer.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.320]   And this is real talk.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.160]   This is not like pretending how beautiful we're doing.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.120]   This is like really pouring out our heart and our pain,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.480]   our struggles, and whatever we're feeling to God
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.400]   and saying, you take this, and handing it over to Him.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   So when my father was diagnosed with cancer in 2006,
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.840]   that was a season where I and my family, we turned to God
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.600]   and we started trusting in the Lord with what was going on.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.800]   And we were handing Him over what we're feeling
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   and what we're worried about and concerned about,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.720]   and of course, asking for God to heal my father.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.120]   And sometimes that praying came easy.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.280]   And other times, you kind of hit a wall.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.280]   And like, you know what?
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.720]   I don't feel like praying.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.520]   Or I feel like I've already said everything.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   What else is there to say?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   It's already been said.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.160]   So there are a lot of circumstances
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.800]   that we cannot control, where we cannot change what's happening
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.480]   out of our own strength.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.400]   I couldn't make my father healthy again.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.520]   But in those circumstances where we are powerless,
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.960]   God is powerful.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.040]   And He wants to meet us.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.800]   He wants us to know His presence, that He is with us,
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.080]   that we are not alone.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.720]   If He chooses to, He also has the power to heal.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.440]   So He is able to do that.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.040]   And I honestly, as we were walking through the season,
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.960]   I do not know how you do that without faith in Jesus.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.600]   You know, what else is there to hold on
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.520]   during these difficult seasons?
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.680]   Honestly, what else is there?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.880]   Jesus is our anchor in the storm.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.480]   As we're walking through these intense periods of waiting
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.040]   and of pain.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:08.800]   So in 2007, my father actually passed away.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.880]   But I can honestly share that despite that--
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.280]   and it's still something that makes me sad even to this day--
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.480]   but me and my family, we experienced the grace of Jesus
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.440]   and His presence as we were walking
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.600]   through this difficult time.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.200]   And I want to share a little bit more
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.920]   about that, how we experienced His goodness.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.160]   I was living in the US.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.320]   I'm from Germany originally.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   I'm a "Datquokian."
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.240]   All right?
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.760]   It's like one of my few words that I know.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.000]   And I had been gone for 10 years.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.120]   I left when I was quite young.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.840]   And I actually even had made a decision,
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.320]   I will never go back to Germany again.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.200]   I had decided that because I loved it.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.480]   So it really was a miracle that I moved to Germany in 2005
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.920]   before my father was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.920]   But then as I was entrusting all of this to God in prayer
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.520]   when once my father was diagnosed,
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.880]   God revealed to me and showed me that He
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.360]   knew that my father would be sick
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.320]   and that He brought me back for this season
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.240]   so I could be there with him, could be with my mom.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.080]   Both of my other siblings were in the US.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.880]   But also because I had been gone so long,
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.400]   I just haven't had as much quality time
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.200]   to be with my father.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.000]   So God showed me His love through revealing that
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.680]   and showing that to me, through His sovereignty.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.800]   He knew about this.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   And He showed us His grace and goodness in that,
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.400]   even though, again, it's not easy.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.440]   On another occasion, my father took my hand,
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.200]   he put it under his arm, and he wanted
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.520]   me to feel a tennis ball-sized tumor.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.160]   And he was sharing with me the pain
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.320]   that he was experiencing that was keeping him
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.840]   from being able to sleep.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.320]   And he also was sharing with me that he was done with prayer.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.840]   And it was like one of those low, discouraging moments.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.160]   And by God's grace, he gave me words of comfort
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.120]   to share with my dad.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.480]   Now, if you're-- you know, some father-son dynamics,
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.920]   it's not always that easy.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.320]   And honestly, I usually would not
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.960]   see myself in the role of ministering to my father.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.080]   But God really gave me the grace to be able to do that.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.000]   And we talked about hope and the resurrection.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.600]   And we talked about when we don't have words to pray,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.800]   how in Romans 8, it talks about that the Holy Spirit intercedes
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.600]   for us, you know, and we lack the words.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.440]   And so I was able to bring some comfort and some hope
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.720]   in this situation.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.520]   And I see that as grace.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.300]   And I'm convinced I would not notice
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.720]   if I would have not entrusted what was going on to the Lord.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.000]   So Jesus really met me, and he met my family
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.960]   in this difficult season.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.840]   And we could, despite the difficulty,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.400]   we could know his love, his presence, and his goodness.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.520]   And if you're walking through a difficult season
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.640]   like that yourself, Jesus wants you to know,
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.680]   you know, his love, his presence.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.200]   He wants to share his comfort with you.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.280]   And I also want to say that, you know,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.560]   we are so glad you're here.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.000]   We love you.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.040]   And we would love to sit with you, listen, talk, and also
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.840]   pray.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.960]   So one of the ways that the psalm encourages
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.520]   us to connect with God as we're walking
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:59.480]   through difficult seasons is to place our trust in the Lord.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.520]   So what is Jesus asking you to entrust to him,
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.160]   to hand over to him right now?
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.720]   Where do you need Jesus to meet you?
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.480]   He wants to show you his love.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.320]   He wants to show you his care.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.600]   So I want to encourage you to open your heart
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   and trust yourself to him.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.320]   So there's other ways that the psalm encourages us.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.400]   And in verse 3, the second part, it says, do good.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.360]   Trust in the Lord.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.280]   Do good.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.680]   Not what comes to mind.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.520]   When I'm thinking of walking through a difficult time,
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.020]   right?
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.280]   Is this a joke?
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.960]   Of course it's not.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.480]   And I want to make one thing very clear.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.400]   It's not that God is asking us to ignore what's happening.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.960]   He's not asking us to get busy working so we can forget
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.040]   about what's going on.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.440]   And we can see that, even just by the fact
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.120]   that it says prior, trust in the Lord, which is acknowledging
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.880]   what is happening.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.880]   And so, well, if it doesn't mean that,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.520]   what is this doing good thing all about?
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.720]   Now, I think there's two reasons for that.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.400]   The first one is, even though we're
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.400]   walking through a difficult season, a lot of times,
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.680]   God still has some good for us that he invites us in,
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.560]   that he wants us to do, that we can be part of,
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.080]   that can actually be quite life-giving.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.040]   But there's a second reason why we're encouraged to do good.
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.760]   Because as we walk through these difficult seasons,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.520]   there is also temptation.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.640]   So in verses 1 through 2, it talks about to not fret
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.520]   and to be envious of the evildoers who are flourishing
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.960]   and are doing well.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.240]   And it's so easy to get focused on others
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:08.240]   and what's happening with them and to get all worked up.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.000]   And if we stay in that mind space
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and we allow ourselves to get all worked up,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.680]   then the temptation becomes strong to actually do
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.600]   what they do to get what they have.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.160]   In verse 8, it warns us of that.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.880]   It says, "Refrain from anger and turn from wrath.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.040]   Do not fret.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.200]   It leads only to evil."
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.080]   So you can see that progression there.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.080]   So we're meant to drop it.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.920]   And we have before us these choices of doing good,
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.400]   but also the choice of temptation
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.840]   and doing what is wrong.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.800]   And they're both right there a lot of times
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.720]   in these difficult seasons as we're walking through them.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.000]   So what the psalmist is saying is that we have a choice
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.520]   in these tense periods of waiting,
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.920]   in these crisis of faith moments.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.880]   We can do good and honor God,
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.160]   or we can become so consumed by our circumstances
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.440]   and perhaps the injustice of what's happened
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.200]   that we do what is wrong.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   So as I was going through a season
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.400]   where my first wife left me,
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.240]   there was obviously a lot of pain and grief
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.720]   and also some anger.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.920]   And it would have been easy to have thoughts of retaliation,
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.320]   of wanting to somehow hurt back.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.480]   And truth be told, those thoughts came up
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.160]   as you're dwelling on this deep rejection
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.560]   that you're experiencing.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.520]   But I'm thankful to God that I didn't act on that,
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.200]   and neither did she.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.080]   And so as I was walking through this time,
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.360]   there was this choice of doing good
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.200]   and good work that the Lord had for me.
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.080]   But there was also this temptation of doing what's wrong.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.440]   Well, what was this good thing that God had me?
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.480]   Here's one example.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.760]   I had the option of teaching,
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.240]   so I had stepped down from being a pastor.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   I'm functioning maybe at 25%.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.000]   But one thing I could still do
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.680]   was teach a Jesus Explored course,
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.080]   which is a very basic introductory to Christianity course
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.240]   for those who are exploring
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.520]   what does it mean to be a Christian?
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.800]   What was Jesus all about?
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.160]   And a safe place for people to ask questions.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.360]   And that was one thing that I could still do, and I did it.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.200]   And honestly, it was life-giving to me
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.240]   in this difficult season.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.400]   It wasn't always easy.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.440]   Sometimes I was like, why am I doing this?
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.000]   But it was still some good that I could do,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.480]   that God invited me into.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.360]   So it's amazing how when we do good,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.800]   our focus starts shifting
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.200]   from what is causing us to be anxious and frustrated
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.620]   to the things that God wants to do through us.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:00.760]   So what are some of those good things right now
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.340]   in your season that God is laying before you?
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.340]   No, we don't have to force it,
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.480]   but if there's something, he will show you.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.440]   Now, another thing that we're encouraged to do
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.680]   in these seasons of waiting
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.240]   is to see God's goodness
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.000]   and to delight in the Lord.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.560]   Now, let me explain this.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.080]   So in verses three and four,
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.720]   really what's happening in the Psalm
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   is that the Psalmist is encouraging us to shift our focus
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.640]   'cause we're so all consumed by what's happening.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.000]   And that's okay, that's natural.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.240]   But he knows if we remain there, that's not good.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.360]   So he's wanting to shift our focus
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.000]   to start connecting with God
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.460]   and to see God in all of this.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.400]   So we're already looked at.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.320]   We're invited to trust in the Lord.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.120]   We're invited to do good.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.200]   And then now we're told that we are called
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.900]   to dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:05.800]   Now, why is this being highlighted here?
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.520]   Well, the land in Israel's history
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.880]   is of course the promised land.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.040]   You know, it's God's goodness to his people.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.440]   And they're meant to dwell in it and enjoy it,
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.080]   enjoy God's goodness.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.520]   They're meant to see God's goodness.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.480]   And he's also not only that,
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.140]   he's also giving them protection,
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.040]   you know, to enjoy safe pasture where they can work,
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.520]   where life can flourish.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.680]   There is something that can flourish.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.720]   But the Psalmist is wanting us to see that
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.380]   because we struggle to see that.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.280]   We struggle to see God's goodness.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.840]   And then the next thing we're told,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.560]   and this is almost like audacious,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.200]   take delight in the Lord.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.100]   It's like, really?
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.000]   Like, I mean, if somebody tells you that,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.080]   you might wanna slap them, you know, right?
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   In the difficulty.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.320]   But what does this mean?
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.120]   Because this is literally the last thing
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.200]   that would come to our mind
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.080]   as we're walking through these difficult seasons, right?
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.620]   So what is this talking about?
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.360]   It's not talking about a fake delighting.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.040]   I don't know if you've ever seen that
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.200]   where somebody just conjures up this energy
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.120]   and is really trying to make themselves happy or feel good.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.120]   That's not what we're talking about.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.520]   But we're talking about a genuine delighting in God
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.760]   and who He is.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.440]   And that really is the Holy Spirit's work.
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.720]   I don't think we can, in those moments,
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.600]   out of our own strength, delight in the Lord.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.280]   But God can give us that, you know,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.480]   through the Holy Spirit's work,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.440]   that we're actually able to see God's goodness,
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.040]   even in the midst of difficulty and challenges.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.800]   So one of the ways that has been helpful for me
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.440]   to move towards delighting in the Lord,
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.320]   and I say intentionally move towards
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.640]   because it's a process or has been a process for me,
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.640]   is to start seeing God's goodness
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.080]   and how He's been good to me in these difficult seasons
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.880]   that I've walked through.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.720]   And a lot of times,
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.140]   we can't actually see that even on our own.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.840]   It's a lot of times through community
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.400]   that for one might be even God's goodness to us,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.880]   but it also helps us to see God's goodness in our lives
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.900]   in the midst of all of what's going on.
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.900]   And so, as I was walking through this difficult season
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.900]   of marital breakdown,
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.240]   I was meeting with my spiritual director
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.580]   and also my friend Tom.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.260]   And we were processing a lot of the grief,
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.780]   the pain, the confusion.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.020]   And that really was the focus at the beginning.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.840]   That's all we talked about.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.340]   But it was a point where it's time for me to shift my focus.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.960]   And so Tom made that shift.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.580]   I couldn't make that on my own.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.020]   And he challenged me.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.460]   He challenged me to see God's goodness.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.200]   And he highlighted ways that he knew
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.940]   that God was being good to me.
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.720]   And one of the ways that God was being good to me
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.360]   was I had people in my life that loved me.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.580]   He had given me a family that I lived with.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.060]   I've preached about that another time.
[00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.900]   It was an expression of God's goodness.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.800]   And being able to see that was so powerful
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.680]   and so encouraging.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.480]   It's like you're sitting in the darkness
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.420]   and suddenly there's this ray of light.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.860]   And that's wow.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.420]   Even here, God is here.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.740]   He's good.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.020]   And of course it doesn't mean that the difficulty
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.460]   or the pain disappears,
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.500]   but it is so encouraging to see God's goodness
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.340]   when we're sitting in this darkness.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.680]   (Tom sighs)
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:46.140]   So I realized that I actually had lost sight of that.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.220]   And I decided to pray and to reflect on that myself
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.620]   because I wanted to see how is God being good.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.920]   And there's been very particular and unique ways
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.500]   that God showed me his goodness.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.040]   And I'll share one.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.600]   The other one is too strange.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.700]   All right.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.640]   But this actually had to do with the Jesus Explored course.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.480]   So I taught that.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.620]   And it's actually one of my favorite things
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.860]   as a pastor to teach these type of things.
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.420]   And there was a mainland Chinese scholar
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.460]   who was attending this Jesus Explored course.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.080]   And it was so amazing to see over the period of time,
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.780]   Jesus revealing himself to her.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.660]   And even her discovering more who God was
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.620]   and getting really excited about God's word.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.800]   And she ended up becoming a Christian.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.000]   And for me, that was so amazing.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.460]   And really was God's goodness
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.760]   that he would use me in this difficult time in my life
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.600]   as an utter mess.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.720]   And I'm not a pastor at that time anymore,
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.120]   but still allowing me to function.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.120]   You know, at least in this instance,
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.560]   being able to care for somebody spiritually.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.400]   And then I also was able to have the baptizer
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.080]   and it was such a great joy.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.500]   So God was, I heard that, Katie.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.400]   So God was being good to me, you know, in this way.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.980]   So seeing God's goodness
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.420]   as a way that we can start delighting in God.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:20.780]   Who he is, his love for us, his faithfulness,
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.020]   his goodness, his comfort.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:29.760]   And we can start doing that even in difficult circumstances.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:35.000]   Now, I wanna take a moment and honor actually you.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.120]   So as a community groups pastor,
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.960]   I get to visit community groups.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.180]   And there's a lot of you that are walking
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.140]   through difficult seasons.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.180]   You know, it's one thing to delight in the Lord
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.740]   when your life is fantastic.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.640]   But to see people delighting in the Lord
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.440]   when their life is very difficult,
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.200]   you know, that honors God.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.160]   And it is so powerful.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.640]   And I get to see it and it's so beautiful.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.840]   And I know that everyone is so encouraged by that.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.100]   And it honors God.
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:16.040]   So earlier I mentioned that a lot of times
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.840]   as we walk through these difficult seasons,
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   you know, that we struggle to see God's goodness
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.920]   and delight in him.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.560]   But God wants to show it to you.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.600]   He wants to reveal it to you.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.000]   And if you're struggling to see that,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.700]   you know, one thing we can do is,
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.840]   for one, be part of a community, honestly.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.760]   As a community groups pastor, I'm obligated to say that.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   But, and secondly, you know, just ask him
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.720]   and pray to reveal his goodness to you.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.760]   And when he does, you know,
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.200]   the Holy Spirit reveals that to you.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.760]   Then take delight in the Lord and give him praise
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.720]   for who he is and how he's meeting you.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.840]   So as we walk through these seasons of waiting,
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.600]   a lot of times we, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.680]   you think about it as just something to get through,
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.220]   where we're waiting for this cloud to lift
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.600]   and then to move on and we picture ourselves as passive.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.040]   But here through this passage, through this song,
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.720]   we can see that we're actually not just passive.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.640]   We're not just being acted upon.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.720]   There's things that we can do and choices that we have
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.440]   to make and how we can respond to what's happening.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   We talked about trusting in the Lord, doing good,
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.220]   enjoying God's goodness and delighting in the Lord.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:35.240]   And as verse seven says, these are all ways
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.360]   and how we can wait patiently for him.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.480]   We're just talking about God who wants to meet us
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.440]   and work and whatever's going on.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.880]   So as I reflect on my own journey, it hasn't been easy,
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.380]   but Jesus has met me every single time.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.240]   And he promises us that when we place our trust in him,
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:05.120]   he will never put us to shame, never.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.200]   He's faithful, he's faithful to his people
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.000]   and he wants to show you his faithfulness.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.760]   So I don't know what circumstance you're facing
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.600]   and what you're going through.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.440]   And I know there's a lot of heavy stuff for a lot of people,
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.760]   but I do know that when we turn to Jesus
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.160]   and place our trust in him, that he meets us.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.320]   When we invite Jesus into our lives,
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   we receive the help, the hope, the grace,
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.920]   the strength that we need to go through whatever it is
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.280]   that we're walking through.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:38.800]   And so he has the power to change our circumstances,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.680]   but it all starts with daring
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.140]   to take the step of trusting Jesus.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:52.000]   Now, for some of us, this means trusting Jesus again.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.080]   You know Jesus, but for whatever reason,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.240]   maybe it's the self-reliance thing,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.640]   just trying to take care of it by yourself,
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.240]   maybe you've been disappointed,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.260]   but I hope that you're encouraged to hand over to Jesus
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.180]   whatever it is that's going on.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:13.240]   But for others of us, it might be placing our trust in Jesus
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.140]   for the very first time.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.560]   Now, earlier, I briefly mentioned that there was a season
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.140]   where I was living in fear.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.460]   Where I couldn't sleep.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.900]   There was actually a time when I wasn't a Christian.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:33.060]   And I was experiencing spiritual attacks,
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.720]   but I didn't wanna talk to anyone about it
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.300]   because I was embarrassed.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.860]   I didn't want people to think that I'm crazy.
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.100]   But it got so bad that I talked to my father
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.420]   and I told him what was going on.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:49.420]   And he asked me, "Tim, have you placed your trust in Jesus?"
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.300]   Now, I have prayed to Jesus many times,
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.500]   but I never surrendered to Jesus before.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.260]   So that evening, I surrendered to Jesus.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.620]   And Jesus met me.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:09.140]   And he set me free from this demonic oppression.
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.460]   And I was able to sleep that night.
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.180]   And I didn't have to live any longer in fear.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.460]   I mean, it really was a power encounter.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.780]   So I believe there's people here right now in this room,
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.060]   but there's also some of you online
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.740]   that like me that evening,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.260]   you wanna take the step of placing your trust in Jesus
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.060]   for the very first time.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:38.260]   And if that is so, if that's your heart's desire,
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.740]   I wanna lead you in a prayer, in a simple prayer
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:46.020]   that actually can allow you to express this desire
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.780]   to express this step of placing your trust in Jesus
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.620]   and asking him for forgiveness
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.540]   and also accepting him as your Lord and Savior.
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.380]   So what I wanna do right now,
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.340]   I wanna actually ask everyone to stand,
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.020]   everyone who's able.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.700]   And in just a moment,
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.700]   we're gonna pray a prayer out loud together.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:12.300]   And if you're using this prayer to place your trust
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.500]   for the first time in Jesus,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.260]   I also wanna encourage you to afterwards,
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.620]   to talk to Katie, she's right there in the blue dress.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:21.840]   We would love to help you to understand
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.580]   what it means to be a follower of Jesus
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.300]   and how you can grow as a disciple.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.100]   But let's pray this prayer out loud together.
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.580]   So I invite you to all pray this with me.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.560]   Let's pray it.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.760]   Jesus, I'm sorry for all the wrong
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.020]   that I have done in my life.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.300]   I thank you that you have died on the cross for me
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.540]   so that I could be forgiven and set free.
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.640]   I place my trust in you and receive your gift of forgiveness
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.140]   and the new life that you give.
[00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.300]   Please come into my life and show me what it means
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.220]   to know you and follow you, amen.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:06.340]   So right now, I wanna encourage you
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:11.740]   to keep connecting with Jesus
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.860]   and pouring out your heart to him as we enter into worship.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.340]   And also if you pray this prayer for the very first time
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.940]   as your step of placing trust in Jesus,
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.020]   your relationship with Jesus has changed.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:28.380]   You're now in a saving relationship with Jesus.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.580]   You're born again.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.180]   So congratulations, we're so excited for you.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.700]   (congregation applauding)
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.700]   Well, let's worship.
