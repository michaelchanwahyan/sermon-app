[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   Hello everybody, good morning. I'm so happy to be here to share with what God has put into my heart today.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.500]   And first of all, I'd like to show you one of my most treasured letters that I have received.
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.500]   This letter is from my late father, who wrote to me when I was around 14 years old.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.500]   He moved back to Hong Kong six months before my mother and I could move back to Hong Kong
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500]   because he needed to start work early.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   And so at that time, my mom and I were in New Zealand, and he was back in Hong Kong.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.500]   So at the beginning of the letter, he talked about how summer was like in Hong Kong
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.000]   and what he did during the day and the routine stuff.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500]   But towards the end of the letter, he would often tell me what to do
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000]   and what you need to do to help my mom out and all those things.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500]   It is because that he has us in mind when he was writing the letter.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.500]   And I'm sure that when you are writing, I don't know if you've been writing letters now,
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000]   but when you're writing a lengthy email or a letter,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   you especially want to pour out all you want to do and all you have at the very end.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.500]   And so this is the heart of this letter.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500]   If you just take the last part of my dad's letter out,
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500]   you would just see him telling me to turn off the lights, close the window, and be alert.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500]   And it's all the things that you need to do.
[00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.000]   But actually, the heart of the letter is that he wants us to be safe, and he misses us,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   and he wants us to be there with him.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And so this is what the letter of Galatians is like as well.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   If you just take apart the letter part, the last part of the Galatians,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.500]   you would see that all is full of things that Paul would like us to do,
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   remind us about the rules and all those things.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.000]   But actually, what he said in the beginning set a tone,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.500]   set the heart of what this letter is about.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.000]   And so at the very end, he's pouring his heart out,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   because it is towards the end of the letter.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He wants to make sure that everyone in the church understands
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and is able to do what his reminders are.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.500]   And so we're reading the last part of the letter today.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.000]   And Paul began by the letter, the whole letter,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   by straightening up what is the true gospel.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   The gospel, as known as the good news,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   is not about what you do to become a Jew so that you could be accepted in Christ.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The good news is that Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and becoming a curse for us.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So in Christ Jesus, you're all children of God through faith.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   And all of you who are baptized into Christ have clothed yourself in Christ.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   And it is for freedom that God has set you free.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And because you are his sons, God sent the spirit of his son into our lives.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And isn't that powerful?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   When we believe in Jesus, we have the Holy Spirit inside of us.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   The Holy Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is living inside of you.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He who leads you to the truth, who empowers you to do good work,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and heals and transforms your life is living inside of you.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And what does that look like?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Well, Pastor Tim last week told us that it would look like a fruit tree.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It does sound like a little bit funny to talk about, "Oh, it looks like a fruit tree."
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   But think about it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   If you see apples on a tree, you know that it's an apple tree.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   If you see bananas on a tree, you know that it is a banana tree.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And when people see that what you do is full of love,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   that you have peace and you make peace,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and that there's faithfulness and gentleness in the way that you connect with people,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   they know that there is something inside of you that is different,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and that is the Holy Spirit in you.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   We do things in love.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   We treat others with gentleness and are faithful.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   We do all of that not because we want to earn brownie points.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   We do all of that because we are transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   which leads us to live a godly life.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And so what does that look like when a group of Spirit-led people come together?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   This is what we're focusing on today in Galatians chapter 6.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So let us read those first together.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   In Galatians chapter 6, verse 1, it says,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently."
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Thank you for reading.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   It's inevitable in a group to work together and be together without conflict,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   especially we know that we are full of faults, full of weaknesses, right?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Paul knows that well.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And so instead of saying, "Brothers and sisters, those who live by the Spirit,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   you need to correct the others," he uses the word "restore."
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The word "restore" means to put back in order or to repair.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It is the word that uses for setting a fractured bone.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   We have to put the broken one back together like a doctor would do.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   So recently I've noticed that I have pain in a lot of areas because--
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   well, if you've noticed carefully in the letter, you could guess I'm not a teenager anymore.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   But I've noticed that I have pains in my arms, and I was wondering,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   "Why was my arm hurting?"
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So instead of telling my arm, "Don't hurt anymore,"
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I need to find out why my arm is hurting, what kind of pain is it telling me.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Is it a muscle pain? Is it a joint pain? Is it a pain because I was carrying a lot of stuff?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   The way to restore my body, first of all, is to listen and to notice the pain
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and then to understand what causes it and then to provide treatment.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And so when Paul said that if someone is caught in sin,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   if we notice that someone in our community is not acting right,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   we should restore that person.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   He's saying that if this community is spirit-led,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   we are not to cut off that person from our community.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   We're not to condemn them and say, "You're not acting right.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You can't be in this community anymore."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   But what we need to do is we need to listen to their pain
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and understand what causes it and to give it treatment.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Let me give you an example.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   When I was a teacher, I came across a very bright kid.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   He knows everything very quickly and he understands things very quickly,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   but he's also the first person to point out where my mistakes are.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   He's always the first person to go, "Hey, that is not fair,"
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and he would laugh at the person who is making those mistakes.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It was not a very good behavior. We don't desire it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   But I want to investigate what causes that.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And so I asked the parents, like, you know,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   "What happened to this person? What happened to this kid?"
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And I did a little bit of observation.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And I noticed that the way that he acts is not because he's a naughty kid.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It was because he was lonely.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   He did not know how to connect with his classmate.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   When he said, "It's not fair," when he said that,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   "Oh, he did something wrong," he noticed that his other classmate
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   would join him to laugh at that person
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   or to do something that is not right or to, you know, act out together.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And in that way, he felt that he was connected.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And so the way that he was doing, the things that he was saying
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   was not because he was a naughty kid.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It was his cry of loneliness.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   It is sometimes true for us too.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   When there is a hurt or a pain, we want to give it a quick fix.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Maybe we want to scroll our phone for 3 or 4 hours at night.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Maybe we want to go shopping.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Maybe we want to watch something that we're not supposed to watch or read.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   We do all of us to numb that pain away,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   to hide that thing that's hurting us.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And we do that so that we don't have to face the pain or the loneliness
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   or the trouble that was troubling us.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   So back to my student.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Instead of telling him off, I started to praise him
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   for the slightest thing that he did well.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Maybe he just tucked his feet under his desk,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and I go, "That's a very considerate thing to do."
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Maybe he was just trying to do things that was easy for himself,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   but I would make sure that he understands,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   "I notice that you're doing well today, and I praise you for it."
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I started to give him class chores
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   that requires him to connect with other students.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And in doing so, he noticed that, "Oh, the way that I am doing now,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   the way that I'm connecting with my classmates now,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   it's a good thing.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I'm still connecting. I can make friends.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And yet I'm helping the school as well."
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And so not only he stopped those undesirable behavior,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   he helped me to lead the class to cooperate with me.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   So as we gather in church,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   do we make an effort to notice those that are in need?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Do we notice those who are hurting in our community?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And who can we connect with to restore?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And the fact is, sometimes we are the one who needs to be restored.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   No one can be sure that they can stay strong and perfect forever.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   We need a loving community,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   a community that we can trust to give us direction
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   and to tell us the truth that sets us free.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So not only are we to reach out,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   it is equally important for us to let people in.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And I know how challenging it is
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   to stay behind a little bit longer after service.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I know it is tiring and draining to start all those small talks
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   at the beginning of a relationship or a friendship.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I know that because I've experienced it before.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Before I come to this church, before I go to any churches,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I went to a church in Fanling,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and it took me three years to let me feel at ease at that community.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Three years. That's 52 weeks times three.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It was hard. I mean, to step into a church where I know no one
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   and I feel like I don't belong,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and to know that maybe that person doesn't want to talk to me,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   maybe I was not good enough to talk to that person.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It was very tough for me to reach out and to talk to those people.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So I know how challenging it is.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   However, Paul encouraged us to connect,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   how our body connects together.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   As we live a spirit-led life, we are to be connected
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   so that if we fall into sin, we have people that know us,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   we have people that we trust to hear the cries of our heart
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   and to be restored.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   So I encourage you to stay behind at the church today.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   There's a bring-your-own-lunch today that is a fantastic opportunity
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   for us just to eat, share a meal, and talk to people
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   that is in the same community as you are.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   A spirit-led life leads you to a spirit-led community.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   In some ways, you can't be loving on your own.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   God doesn't give you love so that you can love the four walls of the church.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   But He gives you love so that you could pour into the people
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   that are sitting next to you.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   You can pour into the body of Christ.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Therefore, that's why in the second verse, Paul continues his thought
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   by saying that, "Carry each other's burden, and in this way,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   If anyone thinks there's something when there are not,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   they deceive themselves."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And what is the law of Christ?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   In Galatians 5:14, Paul said, "For the entire law is fulfilled
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   in keeping this one commandment."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And I hope that when you come into church today,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   you know who your neighbors are.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   In the story of the Good Samaritans, Jesus has told us who our neighbors are.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   The neighbors are the person that sits next to you.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The neighbor is the person God opens your eyes to notice.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Your neighbor is the one that God has put into your heart and say,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   "I remember this person.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I know God has placed me in this church for a reason and for a matter
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   because there's someone that God wants me to love on, to connect with.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   That this person sitting next to me is not a chore for me to connect with him.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   It is because God has put this person next to me in my life
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   so that when I'm in need, when I have burdens in my heart,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   when I'm carrying heavy stuff, I can reach out to someone that I know."
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   God wants you to open up your heart and to let people in.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And I said that I was an introvert.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   It took me three years to feel at ease at that church, and I finally did.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   And it's not because of a miracle.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It's not because suddenly I wake up one day and go, "God, I'm ready now.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Finally, I feel I'm happy.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   I feel like an extrovert, and I can go and connect at this church."
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   No, it was because I was in that community,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   and the people sitting next to me, my peers, they were relentless,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   and they were persistent.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   No matter how many times I've rejected them and said no to meals and gatherings,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   they still invite me.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They still come up to me and say, "Jun, I want you to be here.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   I know that you'll feel loved here.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Don't leave. Don't go to the door. Stay away from the door."
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And that has helped me to be connected.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   They saw me, and they reached out to me.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   And so I was in that church for over 10 years when God led me to the Vine.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I was a different person then.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I was able to go to a new church alone and start to make friends
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   because I know that I'm loved back at my family church.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   I still remember the day when I set foot in the Vine Church in Wan Chai.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   In a room full of people, I felt like I'm ready to head back out again.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   But the love I've received reminded me that I am worthy,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   that there will be people who wanted to be friends with me.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And with that thought in mind, I stayed.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And when you see me now talking and reaching out to people,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   it's not because I can.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   It was because the spirit that gives me joy, the strength, and the boldness
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   helped me through it.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And don't wait for that feeling to come.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Because when we say in the Galatian that we believe and we trust in the God
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   that loves you and sees you, that you've got to trust that He will provide you
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   with the people that reaches out to you.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And so you need to step out before you have the feeling.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   And that is the trust and faith that God is calling us to be in.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And so let's read verse 2 and verse 5 together.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   "Carry others' burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   If anyone thinks they are something when they are not, they deceive themselves.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Each one should test their own actions, then they can take pride in themselves
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   alone, without comparing themselves to someone else,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   for each one should carry their own load."
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Paul assumes that the Galatians will have burdens.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Burdens are unavoidable.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   They may come in the form of mental illnesses or physical illnesses,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   financial crisis, addictions, or family issues.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   But one thing for sure, no one will escape the feeling of weight of such problem.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Because Jesus said, "You will have suffering in this world."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Paul not only assumes that we have burdens, but that we cannot carry all of our own burden.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Certainly, we must first cast our burdens onto our God,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   because He knows it and He will sustain us.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And of course, Jesus bore our burdens on the cross when He died for us in our place.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   But we are also instructed to share our trials and struggles with other believers.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   The ministry of burden-bearing is not just a suggestion that you can,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   if you don't want it, you don't have to.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   It's not a suggestion.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   It is not reserved for pastors.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   To be an obedient Christian, operating under the control of the Spirit,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   you must help others carry their burdens.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And this is what it meant to love, and this is what it meant to be church.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   I think it needs no explanation when we want to help others with carrying burdens.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   We can think of many ways to help, as small as setting the room up for church events,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   or a meal for people who need time to rest and heal,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   running errands for single parents, and all of these are important and necessary.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   But there are also intangible ways that we can carry each other's burden.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   When I was in Australia, I had to share a room with three other girls.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   One of the girls had a hard time keeping her room tidy.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   A lot of parents could run a song with that.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   My daughter is like that too.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   My spouse is like that too.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But actually, that was a little bit extreme.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Her room was messy to the point that we can't walk in her room.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And it was a burden.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   It was a burden for her, and we could go, "Hey, you know, tidy up your room and just leave it at that."
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   But many years later, she shared with us that the way that we helped her
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   was actually not helping her to clean her room.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   If we actually do that, she'll feel that she's not good enough.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   The way we support her was just to sit down and talk to her and hear her problem.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   The way we help her was to accept that, "Oh, you have an issue that you need to deal with."
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   It was not because physically you can't do it, but something was burdening in your heart,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   and I know that you can't do it not because you don't want to.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And so she shared with us, because we're doing that, she felt accepted and she was motivated.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And that acceptance we gave her, the listening ears when she is able to talk,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   helped her and encouraged her to do the next step.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So some can help physically, but some can also help by giving time,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   and all of us could do something to help carry each other's burden.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And we should do it as a community, each doing what we're able to do
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and share the joy as we serve one another.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   And I can see how someone looking at this verse and go,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   "Oh, don't these two verses contradict for themselves?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   One says, 'Carry each other's burden,' and the other said, 'You need to carry your own load.'
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Doesn't those two verses contradict each other?"
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   But the Greek text helps it here.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   The two different words for burden are used in these two verses.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Paul uses the term 'barrels' in verse 2.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   We can look at the next slide.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Paul uses the term 'barrels' in verse 2, meaning a weight or a heavy load,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   but he uses the word 'photion' in verse 5, referring to a soldier's backpack.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   The meaning is clear, that some things in life are so heavy that we cannot bear them alone.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Other matters in life are the equivalent of what you might carry in a backpack.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   So which one is which?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Which of the things I'm carrying is a burden that I can share with others?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And what are some of the loads that I have to carry that is my responsibility?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Well, I can give you two examples to see if you can discern these two.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   The first one, a single parent who's trying to make his or her own end meet,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and the kid falls ill and needs someone to take him to the doctor.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And the second example is that a single parent who's also trying to make ends meet,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   but bought a luxurious item and is using his money irresponsibly.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And we go, "Oh, I know, the first one is a burden,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   and the second one is the load that she or he needs to take up responsibility and put his act together."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   But however, life is not as clear-cut as that.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Remember when I mentioned that our action was a reflection of our hearts?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   We see the action of spending recklessly.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   We make a judgment and say that this is a load that this person needs to carry.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   However, without getting to know that person or listen to this person well,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   we might dismiss the fact that this action is a cry from something that is happening in the heart.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   He or she needs to carry the load of making wise financial decisions,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   but we should help carry the burden of what is happening internally
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   by getting to know that person and listening to that person.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   There is a scene at the end of the film version of Tolkien's book, Return of the King.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   Has anyone watched that movie before, The Return of the King?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   It was a really good movie.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Frodo, who was close to completing the task of dropping the evil ring in the fire.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Once the evil ring is dropped in the fire, it is destroyed, the whole drama is finished,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   he's about to do that, but he was too tired and too worn to walk up the mountain.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And so his loyal friend Sam says with tears and passion,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   "Come, Mr. Frodo, I can't carry the ring for you, but I can carry you."
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   He proceeds to help him up the mountain so Frodo can end the drama once and for all.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Spirit-led believers help the brothers and sisters carry the burden that crushed them.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   This is the picture that Paul is trying to paint for what it is like to be a spirit-led community.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   There is no place for condemnation.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   We are here to restore.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   We're not here to be independent individuals.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   We are called to walk together, support each other, and point each other to Christ.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And if that is the picture Paul is painting and telling us what it is like to be a spirit-led community,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   are we allowing ourselves to be in one?
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Are we willing to call this place our home church?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Are we willing to take root not only in the Word of God, but also the people that God has placed us in?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Paul then--Jesus then told us in the Last Supper on earth,
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   He said, "Love one another as I have told you, so that you must--so you must love one another.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Let us be known by the way we love.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Let us be a spirit-led community by the way we allowed us to be known and known,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   and to serve and to be served.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And I'd like to welcome the worship team back to the stage,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and I would like you to participate to demonstrate what God has been speaking to you.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Could you all stand up?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Let's pray.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Dear Father, we thank you that you have put a spirit in our heart.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   We thank you that in all the worries and burdens and turbulations in this world,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   you have given us an anchor in our heart.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And so that when things are happening on the inside, we can be sure that we have you.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And we thank you that because you are with us, that we know that we are seen and we are heard.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And so Lord, I just bring up all the burdens that this community is carrying right now.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Whether in life you are carrying the burden of a financial decision,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   or you are carrying the burden of family members, or sickness,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   or someone that is bothering you in your mind.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And I just pray that these burdens, we are going to lift them up together
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   through our prayers, through our worship.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Our worship is not the singing of voices as Chapman was saying earlier.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Our worship was our faith singing to you.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   That we know that the burdens here is actually something that you can carry.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   You are bigger than the burdens that we are carrying.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   You are bigger and higher and more loving than the burdens and the troubles that are worrying us.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And so we lift them all up to you.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Father, I pray that as we come together to worship you, we come together to pray with each other.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   That the Spirit that you have given us is going to help us to lead into a Spirit led community.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That we are not coming here to make friends.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   We are here to come to be brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   We are coming over here to know that we are a body of Christ.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   That if one body hurts, we know and we see and we notice.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   That when we come together, we are able to listen to each other and pray for each other.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Knowing that the Christ in us is going to listen to our prayer and answer.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   That the burden that we are carrying that is crushing us, we can share with the person that is reaching out next to us.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Father, I pray that it is hard to build community.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   It is hard to make friends.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   But nothing is hard in your eyes.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Nothing is hard in the Spirit of God.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And so I pray for this community that anyone that feels timid, that anyone has been hurt before,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   that you are going to lift up those worries, that you are going to remove those bad experiences.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Give us a fresh, your Spirit, so that we are able to reach out once again.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   That there is new relationship starting in this community.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   That we are going to see each other as brothers and sisters.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   That we will listen and we'll know that you are with us.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   That your love is our bond between each other.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   I pray for a sense of security in this place.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   I pray a blessing over this place.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   That you are with us.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   [MUSIC]
