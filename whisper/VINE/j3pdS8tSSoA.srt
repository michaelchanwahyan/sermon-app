1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
 Everyone says, "Amen." Can we thank our worship team as always? Wonderful. Why don't you have a seat,

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
 turn around, say hi to someone, say, "Hey, who are you? Nice to meet you here. My name is..."

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,840
 Whatever your name is. I'm so glad you're here. We are so glad you're here. My name is Andrew.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,800
 I'm one of the pastors here at the Vine, and if you're joining us online right now, we're so glad

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,400
 that you're here. Welcome to the Vine. If you're joining us in this room, we're packed in this room.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:38,160
 If you're joining us in the overflow outside, we are also so grateful that you're with us in the overflow.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,360
 Man, what a joy it is to gather together, and something that we should never take for granted,

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:53,920
 the beauty and the reality of gathering together. In the autumn of 1996, in the middle of a pretty

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:03,040
 ordinary week, and at the end of a very mundane day, something happened that completely changed

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,520
 the trajectory of my life. I had just graduated from university from the UK, and I was back in

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,680
 Hong Kong, and I was young, I was single, I was ready to take on the world. I'd just been given a job.

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,200
 I just had my first job. I was hired by a local recruitment company. I remember getting my first

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,280
 paycheck and thinking I was a millionaire, and then I realized that I wasn't because I was living at

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,440
 home with my parents because I couldn't afford to live anywhere else. My parents lived in this small

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,960
 little makeshift apartment in a local NGO here called Mother's Choice, an NGO that looks after

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,520
 orphans in our city, and that helps girls that are in crisis and the pregnancies of crisis under age.

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,560
 And we were brought into this moment where we were living with them. My father was working at

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,400
 Mother's Choice, and they gave us this little makeshift apartment in one of their buildings,

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,120
 and it was a really interesting place to live. It was like living with 100 orphans around you

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,360
 all the time. It was always a pretty exciting thing. And my apartment had unusually two front

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,920
 doors to it. There was the main front door that when you entered into that front door, you would

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
 enter into the living room of our apartment, but there was a smaller side door that was also like

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,760
 a front door, and if you were to enter into that one, you would go into a smaller room, and then

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,400
 there'd be some stairs that would go up to my bedroom, and then to the end of that room, there

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,240
 was a corridor that sneaked around the outskirts of the apartment and then came back in at the

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,200
 place of the kitchen. It was kind of bizarre that it was set up that way, but it just was. And so

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,320
 every day after work, I would come home and I would go through the smaller second door. I would

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,720
 dump my bag, whatever, in my room. I would then go on that little corridor on the outside of our

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,560
 apartment all the way around, and then I would enter into the kitchen. I would open the fridge.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,960
 I would grab a beer, and then I would wonder what is it that I was going to eat that night.

31
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,480
 Well, on this particular day, I'd had a very hard day at work. It was one of those things,

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
 you know, when you're like the most junior person in the company, you get like all the bad work,

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,640
 right? You get all the dumped work on you. So I had this terrible day. I was doing all these

34
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,120
 spreadsheets. It was super boring. I didn't get done all the things I needed to do. I realized

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,360
 I had to take the spreadsheets home with me. I was exhausted at the end of the day. I actually got

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,200
 home later than normal. I went into that little side door, went up to my bedroom, dumped my bag,

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
 got into that corridor, walked around the outside of our apartment, into the kitchen.

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,840
 I opened the fridge. I grabbed a beer, and I was just about to open it when I heard a sound.

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:41,280
 It was a sound that I had never heard before, like that particular sound.

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,920
 It was the sound of a woman's voice, but it was a woman's voice that I did not recognize.

41
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:58,000
 And I realized it was coming from my living room, that my parents had a guest over,

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,360
 which was unexpected, and they had not told me about. And the thing that grabbed my attention

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:13,760
 straight away was that this voice, I mean, if you could have heard this voice, I had never heard

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:21,920
 anything more beautiful in my life. It was like it floated to me on clouds to my ears.

45
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:30,080
 Not only was I drawn by the sound, but I was also drawn in curiosity. The thing about the sound and

46
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,960
 the voice was, although it was beautiful, I couldn't understand a word that this person was

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,080
 saying, because they had a really heavy accent. They were from a country that I could not place,

48
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,760
 and they were speaking English, but I could not understand. And I was so drawn to this.

49
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,960
 And I remember holding this beer in my hand. I hadn't opened at that point. I was literally

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,640
 frozen still, and I had a decision to make. Something extraordinary had just entered into my

51
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:11,920
 life. And I remember turning really slowly and walking very quietly to the edge of our living

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:21,520
 room and pouring around the door so I could see into the room. What I saw was the most beautiful

53
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:30,960
 girl that has ever been created. She was around about my age. She was blonde. She was beautiful.

54
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:41,440
 And she was from New Zealand. Yes. I had no idea what she was talking about,

55
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:51,280
 but she looked just like this. And literally, I'm not kidding. I have not done anything yet.

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,600
 I step into the living room holding my beer can, mesmerized by this woman. And as I step in,

57
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,640
 I hear the audible voice of God, "Andrew, remove your shoes, for the ground you're standing on

58
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:13,280
 is holy ground." Are you with me, church? And I walked in and said hello to the woman who had

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:23,200
 become my wife. Yes. Something extraordinary had broken into my very ordinary and completely

60
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,880
 changed my life from that point. And as we continue our story in Exodus, we're at a moment

61
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,440
 where we meet Moses in his most mundane and his most ordinary. A man who for 40 years has been

62
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,640
 living in a desert called Midian. He's been looking after the sheep of his father-in-law,

63
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:47,200
 who has fled from his status and who he was in Egypt, and was now desperately trying to search

64
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,480
 for the person that he was going to become in his life. And in his very mundane and his very

65
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,800
 ordinary, God shows up with the extraordinary. God breaks into his mundane and invites him

66
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,360
 to make a choice. If you will, it was Moses' beer-in-the-hand-fridge moment. Is he going

67
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,840
 to respond to this thing that is suddenly, rudely, if you will, interrupted his life?

68
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,120
 Or would he choose to just carry on in the same old, same old as things have always been?

69
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,600
 And as you're gathered in this moment, whether in this room or online, I believe that the Holy

70
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,760
 Spirit wants to bring you to that place this morning. If you've been here at the Vine over

71
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,720
 the last five weeks, we've been journeying in the story of Exodus, and today you come to a place of

72
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:43,760
 decision. Today, God is going to invade your ordinary with his extraordinary, and you will

73
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:55,040
 have a choice just like Moses did. Will you decide to respond, or will you decide to remain in the

74
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,040
 comfort of what you have always known? You see, when the Lord wants to bring transformation in

75
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,400
 our lives, it is always to come and change something that's going to require courage

76
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,560
 and faith. And if you're going to continue in your Exodus journey, this is the moment

77
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,280
 where God is going to call upon you for courage and for faith. I want to read this to you because

78
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,440
 this is how Moses, who's writing Exodus, writes of his own story and narrative. This is Exodus

79
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,640
 chapter 3, verse 1. "Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest

80
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,160
 of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."

81
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,200
 Let's just stop there. The first thing he says is he's trying to give you a sense of the geography

82
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,920
 of this moment. Before the extraordinary enters into the ordinary, he gives you a description of

83
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,320
 his ordinary. He's a shepherd looking after sheep. He's so humble, he's so poor, that he doesn't own

84
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,120
 the sheep himself. They're the sheep of his father-in-law, Jethro. He's gone from being a prince

85
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:06,800
 of Egypt in a palace to not even be able to afford his own animals. And there he says, "I am in a

86
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,480
 place," notice this, he says, "Horeb, the mountain of God." He gives us a glimpse right at the start

87
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,280
 of the story of where everything in Exodus is about to go. Because although he doesn't explain

88
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,640
 it here, we come to learn later that Mount Horeb is the same mountain as Mount Sinai, where God will

89
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,960
 meet Israel and give Moses the Ten Commandments. It's the same place. And it's likely that Moses

90
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,320
 had come to this mountain many times as he's grazing the sheep of the shepherd that he's

91
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,480
 looking after. And he's probably circled around this mountain many times. It's his ordinary, but

92
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
 God's about to step in and do something extraordinary. And he goes on to tell us right here,

93
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,960
 "I now call this the mountain of God. We as the people understand this as the mountain of God,

94
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,920
 but before I brought you out of slavery to that mountain, God met me on that mountain first."

95
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:01,840
 And he said this Horeb, Horeb meant glowing or heat. It gives you a little sense of what's about

96
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,040
 to happen next in the narrative. But Mount Sinai, that it comes to be called Sinai, sounds in the

97
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,320
 Hebrew like the word hatred. And that's how the Israelites felt as they came out of their slavery

98
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,000
 in Egypt. And Egypt was still pursuing them. They felt like they were a hated group of people. And

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,080
 God met them in that place and began to restore their identity. But before the identity of Israel

100
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:31,760
 was restored, Moses had to first have his identity restored. So God comes and meets him on Mount

101
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,280
 Horeb. Now, I want to give you just really quickly a sense of the geography of where this is all

102
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,280
 happening. In week one, I showed you this modern day map of Egypt. Obviously, it doesn't contain

103
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,760
 the whole of Egypt. It carries on below the bottom of the screen there. But this is the important

104
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,000
 area. This is an area in the Bible is called Goshen. It's roughly where the Israelites were

105
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,920
 camped when they were enslaved by Egypt. This, of course, is what's known as the Sinai Peninsula.

106
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,400
 Modern day Israel comes all the way down here. But in those days, this land here was not Canaan.

107
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,960
 It wasn't the modern day Israel. That was more up here. And then, of course, you've got Saudi

108
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,600
 Arabia here, modern day Jordan here. Now, the mountain of Horeb is really debated by scholars

109
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,680
 as to exactly its location. There are really two main schools of thought. You remember in week two

110
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,080
 of this series, I told you that there's very little archaeological evidence in Egypt that

111
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,720
 actually Israel was ever in the land, let alone that the Exodus actually happened. And because

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,080
 there's a lack of archaeological evidence, people have debated exactly where all of this stuff took

113
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,680
 place. Now, two schools of thought, one that's a bit of a more modern understanding and one that's

114
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,520
 more traditional. In the modern understanding, the idea is that Mount Sinai is actually over here

115
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,480
 in modern day Saudi Arabia. And when Moses fled, he would have fled across the Sinai Peninsula.

116
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,680
 He would have crossed over the Red Sea here. And then he would have found his new family, Jethro

117
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,080
 and the shepherd and everything over here in Midian. Poole, actually in the New Testament,

118
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,120
 refers to Mount Sinai as being in Arabia. That's the word in the New Testament that we have.

119
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,920
 And so scholars believe that this is here. Now, interestingly, there's quite a lot of archaeological

120
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,600
 evidence for some of the things that are explained in the Exodus in this area. And Mount Sinai,

121
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,080
 roughly here, is actually a mountain in Saudi Arabia that is burnt at the top of it. Nobody

122
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,720
 knows how that mountain got burnt. And so, again, people believe that this may actually be

123
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,800
 the place. Now, if that is the case, Israel would have come out here. They would have come down

124
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,800
 along here. They would have crossed the Red Sea, either at the bottom here or somewhere in the

125
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,360
 middle here. And then they would gather at Mount Sinai here. And then later on, after receiving

126
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,840
 the law, they would have come up here. This is where they would send the spies into the promised

127
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,800
 land. They come back with a bad report. So they wander for 40 years in the desert. And then

128
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,680
 eventually they get released to go into the promised land here. That's a modern understanding

129
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,360
 of what may have happened. However, there's a traditional view that has been accepted by

130
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,000
 scholarship over many years. That one places Sinai right here in the heart of Egypt, in the Sinai

131
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,080
 Peninsula. In fact, if you were to search on Google Mount Sinai, it's likely that you'll be

132
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,280
 drawn to this place right here. There's a monastery right at the foothills here. That monastery is

133
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,240
 called St. Catherine's. It was founded in the fourth century. So Christians, right at the early

134
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,240
 beginning of our faith, some 1700 years ago, decided and believed that this was actually where

135
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,480
 Mount Sinai is located. So that is the place in Egypt where you can go to this day. So in this way,

136
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,520
 Moses would have come down. Midian would have been in this area. And then Mount Horeb, Sinai here.

137
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,880
 When the Israelites were released from their slavery, they would have come down here. They

138
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,040
 would have crossed the Red Sea here. And then they would have met God here. And then again,

139
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,680
 they would have come up here, sent the promised spies in, done their 40 years of wandering around

140
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,520
 here, and then finally up and in at the end of the Exodus. Helpful? Now, which one do I believe?

141
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,720
 Well, I actually think that it's more likely that Sinai is probably in Saudi Arabia than it actually

142
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,080
 is in Egypt. And there's a bunch of different reasons for that, which I don't have time to

143
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,680
 get into today. But we, for this series, we have filmed this particular route for you.

144
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,800
 And we are basing this series out of Mount Sinai, right here in the Egyptian Peninsula. Why? Because

145
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,880
 it's a lot easier to film here than it is to film here. Okay? And also, the whole point of this

146
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,920
 series is not to give you like a documentary of exactly where Israel went. The point of this series

147
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,480
 is to help you to understand the events of the Exodus. And those events can be told beautifully

148
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,920
 by following this here and by visiting Mount Sinai right here. And it's that event that I want to

149
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,160
 bring you to now. Is that helpful? All right. In verse 2 and 3, it says this, "There the angel of

150
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,920
 the Lord appeared to him, Moses, in flames of fire within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was

151
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,400
 on fire, it did not burn up. So Moses thought, 'I'm going to go over and see this strange sight

152
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,680
 why the bush does not burn up.'" This is the moment where God brings an extraordinary interruption

153
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,080
 into Moses' very ordinary and mundane life. God's not finished with Moses. There's much for Moses

154
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,200
 to do. Moses is totally unaware at this point of what is about to be ahead of him. And God brings

155
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,960
 a disruption into his life through this incredible sight of a burning bush. Now, God has revealed

156
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,440
 himself to humanity many times before he now reveals himself to Moses. And he's revealed himself

157
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
 quite directly to humanity before, for example, with the call of Abraham. So the first question

158
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:44,160
 we should have is, why does he do it in a random burning bush? Well, it's fascinating because fire

159
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,560
 in Egyptian mythology meant two things. It meant something that destroys in order to purify.

160
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,200
 Moses, having been raised in Egyptian mythology, having been taught for years in the court of

161
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:05,040
 Pharaoh, would have known and understood deeply what the idea and the symbol of fire was all about.

162
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,520
 In Egyptian gods, they believe that if they burnt something, they burnt it up completely.

163
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,120
 They destroyed it in order for it to be a sacrifice to the gods. So Moses, going about his

164
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,040
 normal, ordinary, everyday, mundane life, he looks over and he sees a bush on fire. That in and of

165
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,160
 itself is not a big deal, but he describes something to us here. He says there was a

166
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,120
 bush that was on fire, but it did not burn up. That's a change for Moses in his mythology,

167
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,840
 in his spirituality, and how he understands the symbol of fire. This fire is burning a bush,

168
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,120
 but it's not burning up the bush. It's not consuming the bush, and it's that that causes

169
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,800
 him to stop in his tracks. This is his beer fridge moment. Like me that day, I heard a sound. It was

170
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,600
 a woman's voice, but it was something in that voice that was different for me. There's something in

171
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,560
 this fire that's different, and he names it for us. This fire should have consumed it, but it didn't.

172
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,320
 What Moses is pointing out is something very important at this point in the narrative.

173
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,960
 He's pointing out the beauty and the power of God's grace. He's saying our God is different.

174
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:15,120
 Our God can burn something and not consume it. Our God can bring his presence to something,

175
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,960
 and it's not completely wiped out. It's not completely destroyed. We don't have to be

176
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,400
 completely destroyed to be purified by God. There's a new narrative that's beginning to

177
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,560
 work its way into scripture here, and he says this is an incredible sight. It's burning,

178
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,520
 but it does not burn up. This would become a symbol for Israel of themselves. The rabbinic

179
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,360
 teachings often speak of Israel as a burning bush. If there's a nation that has suffered more than

180
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,840
 Israel over the years, I challenge you to name one. Israel has suffered so much, and yet they are still

181
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,240
 sustained. That is the grace of God. They are a burning bush. In the same way, Jesus on the cross

182
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,080
 is a burning bush. He took on the sin of all of humanity, all of our sin on his shoulders,

183
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,360
 and the wages of sin is death, and the sin should have wiped him out forever, and yet God in his

184
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,240
 sustaining grace reaches in, redeems and renews, resurrects Christ three days later. The cross

185
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:22,640
 is a burning bush. The church today is a burning bush. You are a burning bush,

186
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,400
 because all of our sin, all of our brokenness should have consumed us,

187
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,840
 and yet by God's grace we are here, and yet by God's grace his church is still growing,

188
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,200
 and yet by God's grace even over two and a half thousand years, no matter how much persecution,

189
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
 no matter what society might say, no matter how this thing might be tried to be contained,

190
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,920
 it is growing. It is thriving. The church is alive in the city of Hong Kong by the grace of God.

191
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,960
 Are you with me? Here's something you need to know right at this point of the narrative,

192
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,400
 because this is so important. It is only ever God who is able to sustain us through the things in

193
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,800
 life that seek to destroy us. Only God, and it is by his grace that we are saved. Paul would write

194
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 to the church, and he would say this, "I am persecuted, but I'm not overwhelmed. I am knocked

195
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,840
 down, but I will rise up again." He says, "There is a sustaining grace on me." And some of you in

196
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,400
 this room, you need to understand that you're facing some hard time. There's something going on,

197
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,800
 but if you're a child of God, you will not burn up. The hand of his grace is on you, and as a

198
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,560
 burning bush, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy, but God will sustain us and renew us. Amen?

199
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,360
 Now this burning bush, really interestingly for Moses, he sees all this, and then he says

200
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,920
 something. He says, "It's a strange sight. It's a strange sight, because I am not expecting it to

201
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,800
 be this way." And he decides, it says here, to go over to the bush. This is fascinating. He actually

202
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,080
 decides to go over to actually see the bush. Now the word in Hebrew here actually suggests this,

203
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,400
 to change his course, to set a new direction. That's what the word in Hebrew means. So I want

204
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
 you to see what's happening here, what Moses himself is trying to explain to you. He's walking

205
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,760
 a normal path. He's doing what he always does in his ordinary, and God sets a burning bush over in

206
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,920
 the distance somewhere. Now think about that for a moment. If God had really wanted to get Moses'

207
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,200
 attention, why didn't he put a burning bush right in front of his current path? Why didn't he put

208
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,640
 it right there in front of him, so that he couldn't do anything, but actually engage with God? Instead,

209
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,000
 God sets a burning bush over in the distance somewhere, and essentially goes, "Will you come?"

210
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:54,080
 "Will you see? Will you respond?" The burning bush is an invitation to respond.

211
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:03,520
 It is God asking Moses whether he will take responsibility for realizing that he needs healing.

212
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:16,400
 It is a beautiful, extraordinary gift of God to say to Moses, "Would you be willing to change your

213
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:25,440
 path? Would you allow yourself to be interrupted? Are you willing to step out of the ordinary,

214
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,320
 so that you can come and encounter my extraordinary?" And Moses himself says, "I'm going to go over.

215
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,800
 I'm going to change my path to understand what is happening here." And the reality for so many of us

216
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,440
 as Christians, and I'm like this too, is that God is burning bushes around us all the time, and we

217
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,600
 just keep walking on the path that we're on. And God is showing up and welcoming us, inviting us

218
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,240
 to a deeper place of healing. He's showing up and welcoming us to deal with some of the sin in our

219
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,640
 lives, but we have to make the choice to turn, the choice to place ourselves in a position where

220
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,000
 we can commune with him, engage with him. We have to see the burning bush and then go over to it.

221
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,880
 And yet fear keeps us locked on the path that we always know. There's risk and danger of the

222
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,000
 unknown when we come off of our normal, everyday path and head towards that bush.

223
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,480
 It takes courage to decide that you're going to change your path. It takes faith to believe that

224
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,560
 whatever there, despite how scary it might seem, might actually be the thing that could truly set

225
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:38,080
 you free. And out of this whole part of the scripture, what God is, I think, asking Moses,

226
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,880
 and I think what he's asking us, is something deeply profound. Will you have the courage,

227
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,480
 the courage to embrace uncertainty, to go over and discover new paths,

228
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:00,480
 or will you choose to submit yourself to your unknown comfort and carry on just like it always

229
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:08,400
 has been? Will you agree? Will you take the risk, the courage, to actually break your path and head

230
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,120
 over towards what God is doing over here and discover new things with him, or will you stay

231
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:21,120
 submitted to your current comfort, just follow on, carry on like it's always been? At this point in

232
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,160
 our Exodus journey, that's the decision that's before you. You can just carry on as things have

233
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,920
 always been, and God will continue to pursue you with burning bushes, but very rarely are they

234
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:40,160
 placed right in front of you. More often than not, they're placed around you so that you take the

235
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,520
 first step towards him. Are you with me? Now I want you to see what happens when Moses does that.

236
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,840
 It's really quite beautiful. Verse 4, "When I looked and saw that he had gone over to look,

237
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,640
 when the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, 'Moses,

238
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,480
 Moses!'" You know you're in trouble when God says your name twice. This happens with me and my wife.

239
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,360
 If she says Andrew once, I'm okay. Andrew twice, not good. "And Moses said, 'Here I am.' Do not

240
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,880
 come any closer, God said. Take off your sandals, for the place where you're standing is holy

241
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,120
 ground." What an incredibly profound and beautiful moment. God has set up an extraordinary bush

242
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,720
 in such a place where Moses has to decide to turn and go towards it, but as he goes towards it,

243
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,760
 God then stops him. But I want you to notice something. God only calls to him after he sees

244
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,360
 that Moses is coming towards him. Come on church. God only calls to him once he sees that Moses

245
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,600
 has made that decision, has said, "I'm going to give this a go. I'm going to go over and investigate.

246
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,280
 I want to know more about this bush that's burning and doesn't burn up." And it's in that step of

247
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:58,560
 faith that Moses takes that God begins to speak, "Hey, Moses, Moses, here I am," Moses says. And he

248
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,400
 says these most famous words in the Old Testament, "Take off your sandals for the ground that you're

249
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,920
 standing on. It's holy ground." And the question we need to wrestle with is, why does he have to do this?

250
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,200
 Why does Moses need to remove those sandals? What is it about this moment? What is it about this

251
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,520
 extraordinary encounter at a bush? What is it about God's presence that is inviting Moses to

252
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,680
 remove his sandals? What is it about the holiness of God in this part of the story that is so critical

253
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,440
 for everything that's about to happen next? Well, to help you to understand that, we took some time

254
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,800
 on our trip around Egypt to actually go to St. Catherine's Monastery that's at the foothills

255
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,160
 of Mount Sinai. And when we were there, the monks introduced us to something that truly is profound.

256
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:50,160
 And I want to now introduce you to it. It's the actual burning bush. Let's take a look.

257
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,040
 Right in the heart of the Sinai Peninsula, a triangular wedge of some 24,000 square miles in

258
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,240
 Egypt that forms a bridge between Asia and Africa, you will find St. Catherine's Monastery.

259
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:14,160
 Built between 548 and 565, this Greek Orthodox monastery sits at the foot of Mount Sinai,

260
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,800
 the traditional site where Christians believe God first appeared to Moses and where the Ten

261
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,400
 Commandments were given. The monastery is named after Catherine of Alexandria, and tradition has

262
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,760
 it that after being martyred in the early 4th century at the mere age of 18, her remains were

263
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,920
 carried by angels and laid in the mountains of this area. The monastery itself is the oldest

264
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,120
 continuously inhabited Christian monastery in the world, with a history that can be traced back over

265
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,840
 17 centuries. As we will see, it is the home of the oldest continually operated library in the world,

266
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,800
 to an order of monks that has never been broken since the beginning, and to a chapel that has

267
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 never fully been destroyed in all of its history. And it is also home to something else unique,

268
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,680
 unparalleled, and also present since the very beginning of the Exodus story itself,

269
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,320
 something which at first glance you might not think is very special at all.

270
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,640
 This is traditionally believed to be Moses's burning bush, the actual bush. Now the bush

271
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,720
 itself is a type of bramble known as Rubes Sanctus, and it's found across Asia and parts of Europe.

272
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,400
 And it's famous for its ability to survive and thrive for thousands of years in the harshest

273
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,120
 environments possible. And what fascinates me about this bush is that it's actually not found

274
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,680
 in any other part of Egypt, except right here at the foothills of Mount Sinai. Now tradition has it

275
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,800
 that when the first monks appeared here to actually establish the monastery, they were so drawn to

276
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,800
 this bush that they created the monastery around it in order to preserve it in its natural environment.

277
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,080
 So think about this for a sec. This bush is incredibly rare. It's also able to survive

278
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,000
 for thousands of years, and scientists have dated this exact bush to the time of Moses,

279
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,880
 all of which has convinced the monks here that this really is the burning bush.

280
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,720
 And if that is true, then the ground I'm standing on right now, well, it's holy ground.

281
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:19,120
 The story in our scriptures is familiar to us. Moses is tending his sheep in the desert when he

282
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,040
 encounters a burning bush and is amazed that it was burning and not yet consumed. And so he walks

283
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,480
 over to it in order to investigate. As he approaches, God calls out to him from the bush

284
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,600
 and commands him to remove his sandals as the ground that he was standing on was holy ground.

285
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,560
 The reason for the need for Moses to remove his sandals has been much discussed in Christian

286
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,320
 history. The traditional view accepted by the monks here revolves around the idea that sandals

287
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,520
 in those days were made of dead animal skin and therefore filled with impurities. And because

288
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,000
 nothing impure or unholy could ever go into God's presence, Moses had to do his part in removing

289
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,480
 those impurities before he could meet with the holy spirit. And so he had to remove his sandals

290
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,720
 before he could meet with the holiness of God. Monks, priests and pastors alike have preached

291
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,840
 this message ever since and use this moment of the removing of Moses's sandals to speak

292
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,400
 metaphorically of all of our need to ensure that we do our best to remove our own impurities as we

293
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,320
 seek to live out a life of holiness to God. Metaphor has a rich history in Christian tradition

294
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,800
 and this is seen perhaps no more so than right here in the museum at St. Catherine's, just a

295
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,480
 stone throw away from the burning bush. Inside are some beautiful pieces of Greek Orthodox art

296
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,200
 and not surprisingly a number of them are about the burning bush. Let me take you inside.

297
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,600
 [Music]

298
00:29:49,600 --> 00:30:12,640
 This piece in particular fascinates me, particularly as we are thinking about

299
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,640
 metaphor in the tradition of the burning bush. This is a picture of Mary, the mother of Jesus,

300
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,320
 holding Jesus in her arms. But what's really interesting is that she's covered in flames.

301
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,800
 Now this is an important metaphor in the Greek Orthodox tradition. They think of Mary as like

302
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,360
 a burning bush, thinking about how the holy spirit came upon Mary as a virgin, enabling her to

303
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,760
 conceive Jesus. And the spirit came upon her but didn't consume her, didn't overwhelm her. Well,

304
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,840
 in that way she is like a burning bush. And for those in the Greek Orthodox church, they approach

305
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,040
 Mary like they might approach a burning bush, thinking that in drawing close to her,

306
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,640
 they actually will draw closer to the holiness of God.

307
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,320
 So whether through metaphor or reality, the story of Moses at the burning bush reminds us to reflect

308
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,640
 deeply on the holiness of God and the sobering reality of our own impurities in comparison.

309
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,360
 And that's an important lesson. But it's actually not the only lesson we should be drawing from this

310
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,280
 narrative. In fact, there's another reason why I think God called Moses to remove his sandals on

311
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,880
 that day. And it's a reason that opens up for us a whole brand new way of thinking about scripture.

312
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,280
 And to understand that, I want to actually open up the breadth of scripture to you now.

313
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,280
 Beautiful monastery, right?

314
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:53,760
 You can visit it. They have accommodation there. It's amazing. I can highly recommend it.

315
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,920
 But I want to show you now what I actually think is happening right here in this burning bush

316
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,920
 moment and why God asked Moses to remove his sandals. And I think it has something to do

317
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,360
 with impurities, but it has something to do with something much more important. I've been saying to

318
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,960
 you every week of this series that actually when Moses presents the story of Exodus, he's doing it

319
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,880
 in the backdrop of Genesis, another book that he wrote to explain God's creation of all things.

320
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,120
 Now, we see at the end point of chapter 2 of Genesis, Moses described Adam and Eve in a very

321
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:33,600
 specific way. He says that they are naked and unashamed. And this is absolutely an unashamed.

322
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,880
 This is absolutely a beautiful statement, not just about Adam and Eve, but of all of humanity.

323
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,600
 And the idea of being naked and unashamed is not actually just speaking about their physicality,

324
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,440
 but the Hebrew words actually speak much bigger than that, much broader than that. It speaks about

325
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,480
 their mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, their relationship with God as well as their

326
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,640
 relationship with one another. The word naked in particular is actually a Hebrew word, which is

327
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:09,520
 this very important word, aramin. Now, aramin literally means this. It means to be laid bare.

328
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:21,760
 It means to be open. And importantly, nothing hidden. This is the idea that this particular...

329
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,720
 I'm going to run out of space again. I did that in the last service as well. It's really annoying.

330
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,760
 Anyway, there you go. To be laid bare, to be open, nothing hidden. This is the idea of what it is to

331
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,760
 be aramin. So it's not just talking about their physical stature with each other, though that was

332
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,560
 true, but it's also talking about this deeper meaning that humanity has this nature that's

333
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:45,280
 been created by God to be aramin, to be open, to be fully laid bare. No hiddenness, no secrets,

334
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,480
 no sin. Sin has not entered the picture yet. And so the way in which we've been created is to be

335
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,440
 naked and unashamed with one another. Yes, but most importantly with God. This is why you see

336
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,400
 the picture in Genesis 1 and 2 of God walking in the garden in the coolness of the night and

337
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,600
 Abba Neve communing with God in a way that was fully laid bare, fully open, nothing to hide.

338
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,000
 Are you following so far? Now, the word aramin is the last Hebrew word of chapter 2 in Genesis.

339
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:19,040
 The first Hebrew word in chapter 3 is another word, and it is the word that literally means

340
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:27,280
 crafty, crafty or shrewd, depending on your English translation. This is the word that is

341
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,360
 actually used to describe Satan. So the snake in the garden was more crafty or shrewd than any of

342
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:40,640
 the other animals in the garden. That word crafty and shrewd is the Hebrew word aram, which those

343
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,720
 of you who are quick on your feet will realize is very similar to the word aramin. Are you with me?

344
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:52,960
 Now, aram actually means this. It means to be closed. It means to be hidden,

345
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:02,320
 and it means to be secretive. This is the nature that Moses chooses to describe

346
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,160
 Satan. And all of the evil and brokenness that happens has the nature of aram. So I want you to

347
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,960
 see what's happening in this beautiful poetic moment of Genesis 2 and 3. The last word aramin,

348
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,600
 the first word aram. Aramin, statement about who humanity is. Aram, statement about who the enemy

349
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,680
 is, what happens through the enemy's nature. And what do we see happen when Adam and Eve take of

350
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,600
 that fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Geneva that they weren't supposed to eat from? Two things

351
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,760
 happen straight away. First of all, they cover themselves because they realize that they're now

352
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,960
 naked. And when they were naked and unashamed, now they're naked and ashamed. And so they cover

353
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,520
 themselves. Then the second thing they do when God shows up in the garden is they hide from God.

354
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,960
 They're secretive from Him. They pull back from Him. They're afraid of Him. Whereas before they

355
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,000
 were naked and unashamed with God because they were fully open and laid bare, sin has now made

356
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,520
 them aram. They are now closed. They are now hidden. They are now secretive. And all of us

357
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,560
 who struggle with sin, all of us who carry around the brokenness that we have in us because of sin,

358
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,680
 we are constantly battling between these two natures. And the enemy wants us to be secretive

359
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,520
 and hidden. One of the greatest works of the enemy is to convince us that actually the very thing

360
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:22,320
 that we've been created for the most is the kind of relationship now that we least are comfortable

361
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,760
 in. We don't want to expose ourselves. We don't want to be honest with people. We want to hold

362
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,720
 back. We want to be closed. We want to be hidden. We've become so much more aram when we should have

363
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,240
 been aramin. Are you following this, Somi? Now, why is this all important? Moses, for the last two

364
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,120
 chapters of Exodus, has been trying to explain himself in the backdrop of Genesis 1 and 2. We've

365
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,600
 looked at a number of those examples over the last few weeks. But here it's critical because

366
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:53,440
 Moses in many ways has lived out how we are as humans. He has struggled deeply with his identity

367
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,920
 and who he truly is. And in trying to live out of his identity, he does something wrong in murdering

368
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,680
 the Egyptian. And what does he do when he murders the Egyptian? He covers him up. He hides him. He

369
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,520
 buries him, thinking he can get away with a secret. But that secret is revealed. He's filled with fear.

370
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,200
 Pharaoh wants to kill him. He runs away to Midian. When he gets into Midian, he's hiding once again

371
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,520
 there. He doesn't tell anybody about the fact that he used to be groomed to become Pharaoh. He doesn't

372
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,280
 tell anybody about his Egyptian past. He even doesn't tell anybody about his Hebrew origins

373
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,000
 either. He hides from all of that. He's embarrassed. He's ashamed. He's broken. He's running for his life.

374
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,280
 He's in fear. He becomes more and more Aram than how he was created to be in Aram. Tracking with this?

375
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,000
 And then God invades his ordinary with his extraordinary. And God places a burning bush

376
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,040
 just off of here to cause him to make a choice to turn and enter towards and walk towards that

377
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,440
 burning bush. And as he goes towards that burning bush, God says, "Okay, great. I see you. You're

378
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,400
 responding. You're drawing near. Now stop, because I need you to remove your sandals, because the

379
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,200
 ground you're standing on is holy ground. And does that mean I need to remove my impurities?" Yes,

380
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,600
 it does. But it means so much more than that when you see it in the backdrop of what Moses

381
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,560
 has already explained in Genesis 1 and 2. When God calls him to remove his shoes, what God is

382
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,960
 really doing is saying, "I want to commune with you again like it was back in the garden. I want to

383
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,920
 now meet with humanity in a way that it was before. In other words, I want the flesh, the naked flesh

384
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,520
 of your foot, Moses, to stand on my spirit and commune with me." Are you with me, church? The

385
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,000
 burning bush is God's beautiful invitation to humanity to say, "I want the purest form of you,

386
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,440
 the most naked and vulnerable, the way you've been created to be, where you and I are in a

387
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,080
 relationship where you have nothing to hide, where you don't need to cover yourself with false

388
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,720
 identities anymore. You don't need to cover yourself from the shame of your sin. I'm going

389
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,360
 to meet you in such a way where we get to commune face to face," which is eventually what he will do

390
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:08,320
 with Moses. In this moment, it's flesh to spirit. It's saying, "A rum is not who you are. And if

391
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,640
 you're willing to remove your shoes, you can rediscover who you are." Isn't that so beautiful?

392
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,960
 "Would you come," God is saying, "and would you commune with me again? Can we be naked and

393
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,120
 unashamed together? And can we from there rediscover what it truly means to be human?"

394
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:33,920
 This is the starting point of everything that changes for Moses. And in his obedience to go

395
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,640
 and have a look, in his obedience to remove his sandals, he stands onto the ground,

396
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,880
 and he says this beautiful thing. He says to God, "Here I am." The Hebrew words mean,

397
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,720
 "I am in complete submission and in love. Here I am before you."

398
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:59,920
 And we don't take any step further in Exodus ourselves until we're willing to come naked and

399
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,040
 unashamed before God and say, "Yeah, there's brokenness. There's sin. There's stuff that

400
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:15,280
 I'm ashamed about. But I have a God who sustains by His grace. I have a God who cools from the

401
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,040
 burning bushes around my life. A God who pursues me and has not given up on me. And a God, when I

402
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:29,360
 turn to Him, lays out the beautiful invitation to be able to deal with my shame through His embrace."

403
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,400
 And His love and His holiness and His goodness. I'm not holy. He's holy.

404
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:41,680
 And in His welcome to become adamim, as I take off my sandals and step to Him,

405
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,640
 we can commune once again. It's really important you understand something. The burning bush was

406
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,000
 this incredible attraction for Moses. It was the thing God used to attract him out of his

407
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,240
 normal life and draw him towards it. The attraction was important, but it's really

408
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,120
 important that you see there was no power in the bush itself. God uses the bush to disrupt

409
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:11,680
 the everyday of Moses, but the bush itself wasn't powerful. What was powerful was the presence of God

410
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,560
 that was coming from the bush. Does that make sense to you? And the reality is that the Vine

411
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,840
 Church, and you need to hear this, the Vine Church is a burning bush. And every single person who's

412
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,640
 here and online right now, you're here because something's attracted you to be here. You've been

413
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,440
 drawn to something here in this community that's attracted you to be a part of this community.

414
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,440
 Maybe it's community. Maybe it's the friendships you've got here. Maybe that's what attracts you

415
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,560
 to come to our ministries on a Sunday. Maybe it's our worship. You love our worship and you love the

416
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,720
 musical worship and it's something for you and you enjoy it and you're attracted and you come for

417
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,280
 that. Maybe it's the preaching or the teaching that's drawn you in, that's attracted you as well.

418
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,840
 Whatever it might be, you need to understand this. There's no power in the thing that attracts.

419
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,480
 And if all you ever do is come to the Vine because you're attracted by something,

420
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,680
 but you never actually push beyond the thing that is attracting you to actually meet the God behind

421
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,280
 the thing that's attracting you, there'll be no power or transformation in your life.

422
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,840
 A church cannot change you. I'm going to say that again. A church cannot change you.

423
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:21,040
 Great music cannot change you. The only thing that will change and transform you and really

424
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,960
 start your journey of exodus is the presence of Jesus Christ and his invitation to you to remove

425
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,360
 your sandals and step on holy ground with him. That's what will change you.

426
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:39,440
 And because there's that invitation, your invitation is not to stand and watch.

427
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,400
 It is to remove your sandals and commune.

428
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,320
 And as I close, everybody's favorite words in every sermon.

429
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,600
 As I close, I want to invite you to reflect

430
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,000
 on the burning bush that is around you at the moment,

431
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,920
 and the beauty that there is behind a God who welcomes you into this moment.

432
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,720
 And I want you just to quieten your heart. And this is what this whole message has been about,

433
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,080
 is this moment right here. I want you just to stable your heart, bring it before him,

434
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:24,640
 and just give you a chance to soak in some imagery and some words that we've created,

435
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,200
 that I'm hoping will help to just minister to you much of what God's word is for you here

436
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,240
 this morning. We're going to watch this together, and then after that, I'm going to come back,

437
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,640
 and we're going to pray together. Thanks, Kingsley, for that. Let's watch this.

438
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,440
 It starts in the fading of light.

439
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:54,400
 In the separation of presence and purpose, in the distance between holiness and shame,

440
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,600
 where we find ourselves humbled and hurting, and where the sacred has become the profane.

441
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:06,400
 We tremble in this hurt and shame and profanity, and stumble between the shards of light.

442
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,600
 For we desire to wander in what is hidden and distant, and wonder if in the darkness we could

443
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:22,560
 ever know the light. And then, when least expected, a spark, and what was ordinary comes alight with

444
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:30,560
 curiosity, and we are drawn forwards, tentative and tender, bruised from being buried, but burnt

445
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,080
 with new hope. And just there, right before us, crackling with longing and intent, the divine

446
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:45,200
 invades the common, and the sacred subverts the profane. And a voice flickers into our brokenness

447
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,760
 like a flame dancing in the night, and we are welcomed into a new story that begins with a

448
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,800
 simple embrace. And when we see it, we can no longer look away, for there is now glory amongst

449
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,120
 the graceless, and the shards of light have become rivers of gold, and we are alive again,

450
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:11,200
 naked and unashamed, nothing now covering the rawness of our humanity from the restoring

451
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:20,960
 presence of an intimate God. So let us remove, let us replace, let us repent, and let us recreate.

452
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:28,000
 May we see the bushes on fire around us, and together step on holy ground.

453
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:44,720
 I wonder if you'd stand with me.

454
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,640
 I wonder whether you'd be comfortable just to open your hands as I pray.

455
00:45:50,640 --> 00:46:00,720
 Father, I thank you for whatever has attracted the people in this room to the vine today.

456
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,480
 I thank you for the bushes that burn.

457
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,960
 But Father, we want to meet you.

458
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,520
 We want to remove our shoes and our sandals.

459
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,040
 And Lord, we want our naked flesh to meet with your spirit.

460
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:25,360
 I wonder if you'd be comfortable just as your hands are open, just maybe picture yourself

461
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:35,120
 just even doing that. Maybe reflecting on some of the imagery you just saw in that poem.

462
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,920
 God invites you to commune with him.

463
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,560
 For Moses, this was the starting point of his healing.

464
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:59,600
 And it begins with that simple embrace, and that desire to be connected.

465
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:07,600
 Some of you in this room, God's been placing burning bushes around you.

466
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:13,760
 And yet you're just carrying on in the same old, same old.

467
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,800
 And I pray today you would like Moses go over

468
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,360
 and meet with God again.

469
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,240
 Some of you here,

470
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:34,480
 there's a fear in you in the removing of your sandals.

471
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,760
 You're not sure what God might say to you.

472
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,760
 You're not sure whether he'll demand something of you.

473
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,440
 Perhaps you're afraid to let go of something that you've been holding on for long.

474
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:54,560
 Know that his grace is here, and his love is so deep for you.

475
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,560
 And he just wants to be with you.

476
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,240
 He wants to bring you back to the garden, which only happens through the blood of Jesus Christ.

477
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:20,240
 And the resurrection of Jesus, sin overcome, we made righteous through Christ's righteousness.

478
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,480
 So for some of you today, it's the righteousness of Christ.

479
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,440
 The blood of Jesus Christ.

480
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,200
 The blood of Christ that the Lord wants you to embrace.

481
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,360
 And some of you are wracked with shame.

482
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,080
 There's no condemnation in Christ Jesus.

483
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,080
 The enemy has placed shame upon you.

484
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,040
 And in this moment, the spirit of God wants to come and just minister to you.

485
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:00,000
 And just set you free from shame through his intimate presence.

486
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,880
 Whatever it is for you, just take this time.

487
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,240
 Try to quiet down the distractions.

488
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,080
 Try to keep your heart centered with him.

489
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:20,640
 Allow yourself to meet with him now.

490
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:30,640
