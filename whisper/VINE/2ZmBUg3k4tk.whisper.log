[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.940]   Well, when I entered university, I was on academic probation.
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.040]   So right from the start, that's how I started off.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.960]   Now, you might wonder why.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.000]   Well, the reason was because I got a very bad score on my SAT exam.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.560]   Now, so if you don't know, SAT exams, you know, they're part of the admission requirements
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.920]   and I had to take it.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.280]   But I have to say in all fairness, I did take the exam after being three months in the US.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.560]   I didn't speak English that well, especially when it comes to math.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.780]   So I didn't understand anything math related on the exam, what they were asking me.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.600]   And so I just had a hard time.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000]   But hey, I made it into college.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.600]   So you know, exactly a reason to celebrate.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.320]   But one of the survival skills that I learned in uni, when I was in uni was that I needed
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.040]   to read the course syllabus very carefully.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.920]   So I understand what's going on, right?
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.000]   So because usually in the course syllabus, you have the exam dates, very important.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.080]   You have the assignments that are due, like your papers and when they're due.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.280]   And then you also have the information when or how your final grade is calculated.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.000]   You know, what assignment counts, what percentage towards your final grade.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.640]   Now, I didn't pay that close attention my first semester.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.280]   And then you really quickly realize you need to pay attention to that.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.680]   So then I started to look and read.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.640]   And that's amazing how different things are graded by different teachers.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.880]   You know, for some, it's all about the exam.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.720]   Every single thing is about the exam.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.360]   For others, it's mainly about the papers.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.400]   For some, it's about verbal participation, like 30% of your grade or 40% of your grade
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.040]   about how you verbally participate.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.440]   And then for others, it's group projects.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.040]   So I learned this mantra or I developed this mantra for myself, which was know what matters.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.040]   You need to know what matters so you can then do what matters.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.280]   And so that's something that I learned early on, that these small things and paying attention
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.320]   to these small details can actually make a very big difference in your own personal life.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.840]   And the smallest of details can have the biggest of impact on you.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.920]   And we can actually see this truth in the Gospel of John, in one of the accounts where
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.040]   we're told about the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.680]   And in that, it's this little, in this account from John, there's this little detail that
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.560]   a lot of times we just brush over.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.760]   But actually, this detail really provides insights and helping us understand the meaning
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.520]   of Easter, the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.320]   And so let me take you to John chapter 20, we're starting in verse one.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   Let's pick it up there.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.320]   It says this.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.840]   Now on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early while it was still
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.980]   dark and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.080]   So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved,
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.760]   and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb and we do not know where they
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.600]   have laid him."
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.720]   So Peter went out with the other disciple and they were going towards the tomb.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.200]   Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.040]   tomb first.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.960]   Then stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.720]   Then Simon Peter came following him and went into the tomb.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.800]   He saw the linen cloth lying there and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus's head,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.720]   not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.360]   Then the other disciples who had reached the tomb first also went in and he saw and believed.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   So John here, he is giving us a personal account of what he found on that very Sunday, that
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.500]   first Easter Sunday morning.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.960]   We could also say it's an eyewitness testimony to what he experienced.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   He reports that Mary Magdalene went early in the morning while it was still dark.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.760]   So basically after the Sabbath was finished and then people were allowed to be mobile
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.120]   again, so she goes to the grave.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:43.200]   Apparently he wanted to maybe finish some of the ceremony to put Jesus into the grave.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.800]   And lo and behold, the stone is rolled away.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.200]   And so she runs back to the disciples and she tells them that somebody has taken the
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.180]   body of Jesus, that they have put it somewhere else.
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.360]   Now one thing I want you to notice here that's interesting is that a lot of times we treat
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.760]   ancient people as very naive, like that they were kind of stupid and they didn't really
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   get it.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.600]   They so easily believed in the resurrection.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.680]   But I want you to notice with Mary Magdalene, her first thought is not Jesus' body is gone,
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.960]   he must have risen.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.880]   Her first thought is that somebody must have stolen the body of Jesus.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.360]   Because ancient people also didn't easily believe in the resurrection.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.960]   It was not their first thought, just like it's not our first thought.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.300]   Now who might have stolen the body?
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.300]   Why did she think that?
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.040]   Maybe it was some of the Roman soldiers, maybe it was some of the religious leaders, maybe
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.000]   it was just grave robbers.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.980]   That was a thing during that time because there was valuable things in the graves.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.960]   And so she assumes that and she tells Peter and John, and this is my favorite part, or
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.360]   one of my favorite parts, they run to the tomb and were told that John, who's the disciple
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.080]   whom Jesus loved, that he ran faster, he got there first.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.520]   And I actually was searching for a meme, there was a ton of memes on this.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.480]   I couldn't find the one I was looking for but I saw this comment and I was like, you
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.800]   know, it just sums this up perfectly.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.880]   It says, "This was the most unnecessary flex of all time."
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   Right?
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   Where somebody's like showing off.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.680]   It's like, "Hey, I was faster than Peter."
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.440]   And by the way, Peter was also an older man so he like outran the old man, right?
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.560]   So but why is that in there?
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560]   Why is that in there?
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.240]   Well, because it's the account of what actually happened.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.840]   So Peter did outrun, not Peter, John did outrun Peter.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.560]   So he's just reporting what happened even though we like making little jokes about that.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.280]   And so when John gets there, he stoops down, he looks into the tomb and he sees linen strips
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   lying there.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.560]   And he doesn't go inside, perhaps because Peter had more seniority among the disciples,
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.360]   you know, was a leader among the disciples.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.120]   But it might also be because who knows what would await him in that tomb.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:18.240]   You know, this beloved Jesus, this leader, and what might he find, especially if the
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.280]   tomb had been raided.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.120]   You know, so I mean, there are grievings though.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.760]   This, you know, this was not something you easily, I don't know if you would easily run
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.760]   into a grave.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.320]   You know, so but then Peter comes, totally different personality.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.040]   He just rushes right in.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040]   That's Peter.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.080]   He just rushes into situations.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.440]   And he says right away what he thinks.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.600]   And so, and this is where we find that little detail that so often is overlooked that I
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.080]   want to highlight to you.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.160]   So in kind of towards the end of verse six and verse seven, he says, he saw the linen
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.600]   cloths lying there and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus's head.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.440]   So that detail that is not mentioned anywhere else besides the gospel of John is the face
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   cloth.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.800]   So that's the only place where that's mentioned.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.240]   Now there's also a different way of calling that you can call it a burial shroud.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.560]   So that's the first thing I want to highlight.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.240]   But the second thing, they kind of go together is that face cloth that, you know, had been
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:27.440]   on Jesus's head was not lying with the linen cloth, but folded up and placed by itself.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.760]   So I have an image here, you know, for you to look at of the linen cloth being folded
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   up.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.040]   Kind of get an idea of what that might have looked like.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.640]   And this burial shroud right there.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:51.200]   And now the question we have to ask ourselves is why does John include these details?
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   Such a little detail, but why does he decide to record this?
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.760]   Well, I think the first thing we need to do is we need to understand what a burial shroud
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   is.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:07.400]   Well, a burial shroud for one was, well, first they wrapped the body with linen cloths.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.040]   It was not mummification, not like Egyptians, but they still wrapped the whole body.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:19.200]   And then at the end, they placed the burial shroud around the head, like tightly wrapped.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.680]   And that burial shroud symbolizes three things.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.720]   First it's to hide the face from other observers and to give the person who has passed away
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.720]   dignity.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.800]   Secondly, it was placed around the head if there was wounds or anything else to cover
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   that up.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:42.000]   And then finally, and that's the most important reason or what the symbolizes is that the
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.720]   person actually had truly died.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.960]   They had passed from life to death.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.760]   And so that's what that shroud symbolizes.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:59.760]   So John, he draws our attention to the seemingly small detail.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.000]   And what he's saying with that is Jesus truly died.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.120]   The execution from the Romans on the cross, it was successful.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.920]   He was not unconscious and then later on woke up.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.720]   He was not just falling asleep.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.440]   You know, Jesus had truly died.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.520]   You would not wrap this burial cloth around a person's head, you know, if they're still
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.400]   breathing.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.020]   So death had fully taken its course.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:40.300]   And so what might seem like a small detail of a much larger narrative of the resurrection
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:48.540]   of Jesus, it's actually the central point of this whole resurrection story.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.600]   But to understand that we actually need to take a step back and we need to take a further
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:11:01.280]   step back in the biblical story and we need to look at this larger, broader story of humanity.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.500]   So let me do that with you.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:11.960]   About 700 years before, you know, the empty tomb where Peter and John are standing, Israel
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:19.480]   experienced the most traumatic, painful thing they had gone through.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.040]   And what happened was that Babylon had attacked Israel.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:29.680]   They had attacked Israel and they had conquered Jerusalem.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.360]   They had destroyed the temple.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:38.760]   They had killed many people and then they took people captive and they deported them
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.880]   to Babylon.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:49.300]   Now all of this was a consequence of Israel's ongoing sin.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:56.080]   There was just these cycles of sin and rebellion against God and it didn't stop.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.640]   But I actually want to take us even further back to the beginning of the Bible, to Genesis
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.120]   3 in the story of humanity, where humanity, you know, they're not supposed to eat the
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.400]   fruit.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.600]   God tells them not to.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   They rebel against God.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   They do it anyhow.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:22.180]   And the relationship between God and people is impacted by sin.
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:28.420]   So the relationship between God and us and God, us and each other, us and ourselves,
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.760]   us and creation, sin runs now right through all of it.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.100]   And there's brokenness in all of those relationships.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.600]   And so the result is clear, right?
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.820]   Before the fall, before sin entered the world, these relationships, they flourished, they
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.820]   thrived.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.620]   There was wholeness, shalom.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.180]   There was peace.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:56.340]   And in all those relations between us and God, us and other people, even with ourselves,
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.860]   we have peace with ourselves and us and creation.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.940]   But now that sin had entered the world, you know, all those relationships are ruptured
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:12.780]   and we just experience just this brokenness, this pain, this heaviness, and in all of those
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.140]   relationships.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.880]   And so then if you keep reading in the Bible from Genesis 4 onwards, it's just the story
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:25.140]   of the sin and this brokenness and this pain unfolding and moving forward.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:30.860]   Now there's still good things, but there is a lot of pain and there is a lot of brokenness.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.200]   And so we all find ourselves entangled in the story of humanity, every one of us, every
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.320]   single person.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.660]   We all have sat in the consequences of sin.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.720]   You know, we all have sat on it.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.200]   You know, whether it's somebody did something to us, a word that was spoken that was hurtful
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:14:00.960]   and painful, whether it was an action done to us and we just felt the brokenness of that.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.040]   I feel like a lot of times it's also what we did, right?
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.680]   That we sit in our own brokenness where we did something, where we said something, a
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:15.100]   word we cannot take back, and that just has ruptured relationship.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.100]   And so we all have felt that.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.480]   And to take that even a little bit further, because sometimes we feel like, you know,
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.320]   sin is like just these big things like murdering somebody, you know, and it's not really my
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.880]   issue or sin doesn't really run through me in these relationships.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:40.160]   But just imagine your life on a video displayed right here in front of everyone, every detail
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.080]   of your life.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:49.600]   You know, everything that you said, everything that you thought, like with subtitles.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.760]   And I'm convinced every one of us would be embarrassed by that video.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.880]   Let's never do this, okay?
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.880]   Let's never do this.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.600]   I know I would be.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.080]   I would be deeply embarrassed if you would see my video.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.160]   I know.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.960]   And we're not even needing to talk about going back our whole lives.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.480]   We can just go back a month.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.760]   That's probably already enough to deeply embarrass us.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.920]   You know, so what this means is that sin really runs through all of our lives.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.160]   It's just that there's a brokenness, there's a fallenness, there's a pain where we are
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:26.240]   just stuck in the cycle of just, you know, hurting others, being hurt, doing things we
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:32.720]   actually don't want to do, but we do them nonetheless.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   Now going back to the biblical story in the Old Testament, it's a story of people longing
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.280]   to be restored with God, longing for that, that what has been disconnected, be reconnected
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.120]   with God.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:56.640]   And it's also the story of God desiring to reconnect with people, to redeem his people,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.060]   to reverse this brokenness.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:10.040]   And all of this brings us back to this climax, to the story of where Babylon, Egypt, oh my
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:16.640]   gosh, naming all the nations here, where Israel, there you go, I found it.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:27.200]   Where Israel is sitting just in the trauma of their sin having taken full course and
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.040]   they're just sitting in their brokenness, you know, in Babylon.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.140]   And there's reflection and there's just darkness, there's hopelessness.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:45.920]   And into that moment, God begins to speak about the work that he's going to do, about
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.880]   the transformation that he is going to bring.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.420]   And he does that through the prophets.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.920]   And one of the prophets he does that through is the prophet Isaiah.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.120]   And he gives Isaiah this vision.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:09.280]   And in this vision, Isaiah goes back to Jerusalem, to this hill, this mountain in Jerusalem.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.160]   And it's the mountain where the temple used to stand on, but it was destroyed.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.120]   And Isaiah doesn't just go back to the ruins of the past in this vision, but it is also
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:26.680]   a vision of a future where God is doing something new, where God is doing something powerful,
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.780]   where God is doing something beautiful on that very mountain.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.840]   And so I want to show you this picture that God gives Isaiah.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:42.000]   So we're in Isaiah 25, starting in verse six, and it says this.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   On this mountain, the Lord Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.180]   of aged wine, the best of meats and the finest of wines.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.320]   On this mountain, he will destroy the shroud that unfolds all people, the sheet that covers
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.000]   all nations.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.160]   He will swallow up death forever.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.140]   The sovereign Lord will wipe away the tears from all faces.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.160]   He will remove his people's disgrace from all the earth.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.920]   The Lord has spoken in that day.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   They will say, "Surely this is our God.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.740]   We trusted in him and he saved us.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.740]   This is the Lord.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.560]   We trusted in him.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   Let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation."
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.520]   Now, do you catch that?
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.640]   Do you see what is happening here?
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:44.860]   So 700 years later, Jesus is on this very mountain.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.220]   He has died and then he has risen.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.740]   And Isaiah has this vision of that very same mountain.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:19:00.540]   And he sees it as a place where God is going to destroy this burial shroud that wraps up
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.220]   everyone, the sheet that covers all nations.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.620]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.460]   I find that amazing.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:16.700]   Now what a powerful picture Isaiah paints here of humanity and where it finds itself,
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.700]   right?
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:25.980]   He talks about that the shroud that unfolds all peoples and covers all nations.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:31.340]   It's as if like humanity has these linen strips just wrapped all around them.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:37.020]   It's as if this burial shroud is around our faces and we're just not free to move.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:43.720]   We can't break free from these grave clothes that we're wearing.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.660]   And we're not able to be the person that we want to be.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:48.660]   We can sense it.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.540]   We know it in our hearts.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.660]   We're not fully who we want to be.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:59.060]   And we're also not the person that God created us to be.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:03.940]   And in the New Testament in Romans 6, 23, it kind of explains this condition.
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:10.040]   It says, "The wages of sin is death."
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.480]   And really that's before there was sin, there was no death.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.340]   When sin has entered the world, death has entered the world.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.460]   And death's purpose is to destroy.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.940]   Sin's purpose wants to bring death to relationships, death through our relationship with God, death
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.860]   in all aspects of life.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.460]   And that's as if, you know, Isaiah gives us this picture of we are wrapped up, we are
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:42.820]   entangled and we are just captive, you know, by these clothes and by these shroud.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.140]   And sin enfolds us.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.140]   It's heavy on us.
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.400]   It weighs on us.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.060]   And its only goal is to bring us down.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.140]   But this is why this prophetic vision from Isaiah is so important.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:04.260]   Despite the darkness of humanity's sin that has taken place ever since the fall, Isaiah
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.540]   pictures a divine intervention.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:13.380]   You know, God does not leave us in this darkness, but he has come to liberate us, to set us
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:18.300]   free from this darkness, to break us free.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:25.020]   God who has the power to step in, and as it says in verse 7 in Isaiah 25, to destroy the
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:31.980]   shroud that unfolds all people, the sheet that covers all nations.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.980]   And note what it says here.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.100]   It says all people, all nations.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.600]   It doesn't just say Israel.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.720]   So this is a greater work of liberation that God will do.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:51.700]   So God's rescue is for all people in all nations, for anyone who trusts, who believes in him.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.980]   That is the powerful message of Easter.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:00.060]   And Isaiah shows us in this passage this great reversal.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:09.000]   You know, there is a turning point in the story of humanity and of our world where sin
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.860]   and death are no longer the end of the story.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:20.360]   You know that he will remove the shroud that unfolds his people, the burial shroud that
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.940]   has been weighing us down.
[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.700]   And it's this picture of that he will wipe away every tear.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.420]   He will remove our shame.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.660]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:39.900]   He will remove our disgrace and our shame, and he will provide for us salvation to all
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.000]   who believe in him.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.640]   And so now this brings us back to John and John and Peter standing in the tomb.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:57.180]   And John tells us that the, in verse seven, that the burial shroud was not lying with
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:03.700]   the linen cloth, but was folded up in a place by itself.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.700]   So did you catch that?
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.780]   It was folded up, the burial shroud.
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.100]   It was no longer wrapped around Jesus.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:19.960]   What John is declaring in a small detail is this very prophecy from Isaiah has been fulfilled.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:26.180]   The shroud that has unfolded all people has been removed through the death and resurrection
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.460]   of Jesus.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:32.260]   The power of sin and death has been broken over our lives.
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.820]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.780]   That is absolutely amazing.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:46.540]   So Jesus' resurrection means that sin is defeated, that the power of death is no longer the final
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.740]   story.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.080]   It doesn't have to be your final story.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.460]   So as Jesus said on the cross, it is finished.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:06.540]   You notice this, all this brokenness and separation and hurt and pain, you know, it has come to
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:15.660]   an end when Jesus died and rose and he removes the burial shroud and he creates a path for
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:21.340]   all who place their faith in him, for all who believe in him, you know, to have new
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.500]   life in Jesus.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.500]   Can I get an amen?
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   Amen.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   Amen.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.500]   Thank you.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:35.140]   So Jesus has won the decisive victory to liberate us from our sin and to break us free from
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.040]   the shroud that has unfolded us.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:47.180]   And you know, it's in the small details that we can so easily overlook, you know, that
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   we actually find a beautiful picture of the meaning of Easter.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.060]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.700]   That this burial shroud has been removed, these clothes, they could not contain Jesus.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.380]   He bursts out of them.
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.020]   He has broken free.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.060]   He folds it up neatly, sets it aside.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.220]   I'm done with this.
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.300]   And you know, it's also like there's all this chaos.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   I love that.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.500]   So Jesus apparently is neat, right?
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.680]   He's a neat, neat guy.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:23.700]   So he brings out in chaos, he brings order.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.220]   You know, in chaos, he brings order.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.380]   So he wants to bring order into your chaotic life.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:38.020]   He also wants to remove this shroud from your face for anyone who places their trust in
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.420]   him, for anyone who believes in him.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.300]   And he wants to remove it and set it aside so that you can be free, that you can live
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:52.580]   the life that God has created for you and that sin and death is no longer the end of
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.200]   your story.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:00.080]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.280]   And Jesus's resurrection, the burial shroud of death is lifted off the faces of all those
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.760]   who believe in him.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:20.040]   Jesus's resurrection is a joyful declaration that a new age, a new time has begun.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:27.820]   It's a time where death is replaced with life, where mourning and pain, they're replaced
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:37.260]   with dancing and with joy, where tears are replaced with praise.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:43.700]   Now we still know the impact of sin in our lives.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:50.640]   We still know that even when we know Jesus, but it is no longer the end of our story.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:59.040]   And so I want to actually extend an invitation to anyone who would like to place their faith
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.340]   in Jesus, you know, who would like to experience this being set free from these grave clothes
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:10.460]   that entangle us and experience this new life that Jesus gave.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:16.340]   John, at the beginning of his gospel, he says, he's talking about Jesus, "To all who did
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:26.420]   receive him, to those who believed in him, he gave the right to become children of God."
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:35.860]   So I just want to give this opportunity to receive and to believe in Jesus and to experience
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.900]   what it means to be a child of God.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.580]   That's why we're celebrating Easter today, and I want you to join in on the celebration
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.780]   with us.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:49.160]   So the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to lead you in a prayer.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.780]   And if you want to become a Christian, if you want to receive this new life that Jesus
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.900]   gives, and the way you can make this your own is basically you repeat it in your heart
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.540]   quietly.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.820]   And you know, you just talk yourself to Jesus, but I'll give you some guidance on how to
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.860]   do that.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.700]   And so I'll do that right now.
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.700]   I'll lead us in a prayer.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.340]   Let's pray.
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:23.660]   Jesus, thank you so much that you love us so much.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:31.420]   I now want to turn away from all the bad stuff in my life.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:37.220]   And if there's any sins that you need to ask for forgiveness for right now, actually take
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.940]   a moment to do that.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:56.860]   Just tell Jesus, "I'm sorry for these things."
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:01.580]   And let me continue with a prayer.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:11.740]   Thank you, Jesus, that you died for me so that I can be set free and forgiven.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:21.340]   I now receive your forgiveness and I place my trust in you.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:31.820]   Jesus, will you come into my heart by your Holy Spirit and will you make me your child
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.580]   forever?
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.580]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.020]   Amen.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.460]   Amen.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:46.220]   Now, I want to ask if anyone has prayed this prayer, if you can give me a little wave.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:51.900]   I can't really see much anyhow, but yeah.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:57.740]   So if you've prayed this prayer, if you made us your own, this really is a turning point.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:03.540]   Sometimes you feel immediately, this is just changing you, this weight lifted off you.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.780]   Other times it comes over time.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:12.660]   We would love to encourage you in that step that you've taken and encourage you in that
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.720]   journey.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.000]   So if you would share with us, we can do that.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:25.300]   But I want to invite right now everyone to stand and we'd love to pray over all of us.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:38.120]   Jesus, we thank you so much that you came to this earth to rescue, to redeem us, that
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.580]   you love us so much.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   We thank you that you laid down your life, though you were innocent, you didn't do anything
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:52.140]   wrong, but you took, you bore our sin on the cross so that we can be forgiven, that we
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.260]   can have new life in you, that we can have resurrection life in you.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:02.060]   And Jesus, I pray that today on this Easter where we celebrate that you died and rose,
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.860]   where we celebrate that you removed that burial shroud that has been weighing us down for
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.420]   anyone who believes in you.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:15.260]   Lord, I pray that you fill us up again with your joy, with this joy of the Holy Spirit
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.340]   of this work that you have done, that you have overcome sin and that you have overcome
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.340]   death.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.580]   Lord, I also want to pray for anyone who is struggling.
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:29.600]   Just because we're Jesus followers, just because we're Christian doesn't mean that we don't
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.100]   still struggle with things, that we don't struggle with sin and brokenness, though.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.780]   But I just pray for your grace right now.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.900]   Thank you that your forgiveness is always available.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:45.680]   And I pray that you would just flood our lives, that you would flood us with your grace.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:51.300]   And so we give you all the praise, all the glory, and we thank you for this beautiful
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.300]   day.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.140]   We remember that you have risen, Jesus.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.580]   I pray this in your name.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.100]   Amen.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:56.940]   Amen.
