[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   We want to warmly welcome each and every one of you here tonight on this Good Friday.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.400]   Tonight we journey together and we reflect on the death of our Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.520]   and we really take this time to contemplate what his sacrifice means to us as believers.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.680]   And as we gather around the cross tonight, we are going to listen to God's Word.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.240]   We are going to listen to Scripture and we will respond in song, respond in liturgical
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.840]   prayer, and we do this together.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.440]   For those who have come with our children, no matter how young or how old, I want to
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.160]   encourage you to enjoy this time as a family, worship together, pray together, take communion
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.000]   together.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.160]   A special part of tonight's service together is we are going to respond to the living God
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.520]   through liturgical prayer.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   And simply put, these are prayers that involve all of us as a community responding reflectively
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.320]   and prayerfully back to God.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.560]   And so the form of these prayers is a call and response.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.840]   As a service leader, I will pray and I will read out the part under service leader, and
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.400]   you will respond as a congregation, all of us in one voice, and you will pray and read
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.640]   the parts titled congregation.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.960]   You will understand once we pray and respond in a few lines.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.680]   Regardless of where you are in life, what you're going through, tonight, our living
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.160]   God meets us.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.960]   And just as always, as you come and worship, we want you to just be yourself and respond
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.180]   with a worshipful heart.
[00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.840]   And so let us open our hearts to God and behold and contemplate Him.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.140]   And as we do, know that God hears us.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.820]   As we speak, we speak directly to God.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.080]   And as we gather here, He is with us.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.900]   Psalm 22 says, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.040]   Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.380]   My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.620]   By night, I find no rest.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.500]   Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.620]   You are the one Israel praises.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.700]   In you, our ancestors put their trust.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.320]   They trusted and you delivered them.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.380]   To you, they cried out and were saved.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.320]   In you, they trusted and were not put to shame.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.660]   But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.660]   All who see me mock me.
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.360]   They hurl insults, shaking their heads.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.440]   He trusts in the Lord, they say.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.560]   Let the Lord rescue him.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.040]   Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.920]   Yet you brought me out of the womb.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.360]   You made me trust in you, even at my mother's breast.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.440]   From birth, I was cast on you.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.200]   From my mother's womb, you have been my God.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.140]   So do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.080]   My heart has turned to wax.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.160]   It has melted within me.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.400]   Things surround me.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.840]   A pack of villains encircles me.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.480]   They pierce my hands and my feet.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.800]   All my bones are on display.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.400]   People stare and gloat over me.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.560]   They divide my clothes amongst them and cast lots from my garment.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.900]   But you, Lord, do not be far from me.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.240]   You are my strength.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.760]   Come quickly to help me.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   Deliver me from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   Rescue me from the mouth of the lions.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.120]   Save me from the horns of the wild oxen.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.960]   We couldn't help but fall asleep.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.400]   I mean, we didn't want to.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.560]   We tried to stay awake, but we were just so tired from all the things that had happened
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.280]   in the week that we had arrived in Jerusalem.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.920]   And we had gathered now on the top of Mount Olives, and we were looking out on the beautiful
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.400]   temple, and we were trying our best to stay awake and to pray.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.240]   And just, he stood off in the distance in the dark, praying a line.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.240]   It was Peter who fell asleep first, of course.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.840]   And as soon as he fell asleep, well, I guess we thought it was permission for all of us
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.480]   to fall asleep.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.800]   And then that thing I remember is being shaken awake by Jesus himself.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.220]   He was angry at us for the weakness that we had to not kind of pray in this hour of need.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.700]   But I remembered he was agitated.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.280]   Not just agitated at us, but agitated because he was carrying something.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.480]   I'd actually never seen this in him before.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.840]   A weight upon him, a precious weight that he was carrying that he didn't know how to
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   shake.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.920]   And as he walked off again into the darkness to pray, I decided this time I would follow
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   him.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.040]   I would come after him, and I would sit behind him and listen to what he was saying.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.560]   And I found this old olive tree, and I sat behind it.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   In the quietness, I leaned in and listened intently.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.000]   The sound Jesus was making was one I had not heard before.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.440]   It was like this low, guttural kind of sound, like a moaning.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.880]   And I realized that he was sobbing.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.560]   And as I quieted myself down, I tried to hear what he was saying in his prayer.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.920]   And I could barely make out the words.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:44.480]   He was saying, "Father, take this cup from me, but not my will, your will be done."
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.640]   And then the words were coming out like a raspy breath, like he was spitting the sound
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   out.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.160]   And he was praying it over and over again.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.640]   And each time it seemed more urgent for him, as if God was not answering him.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.760]   Take this cup, take this cup, take this cup.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.320]   And so I ran back to the others, and I got them ready.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.600]   And I said, "We need to pray fervently."
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.880]   And so we started to pray the prayer that he had taught us to pray.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.600]   "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.920]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.480]   Your will be done."
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.520]   Not our will, your will.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.560]   I didn't anticipate that that prayer would be answered so quickly.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.680]   It was actually James who heard him first, although we eventually all heard it.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.320]   Judas had a way of walking that was distinct, large and heavy footsteps on the ground.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.160]   The kind of sound of someone who was so arrogant to think that his presence needed to be announced.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.880]   And as he was walking, we could also hear other footsteps, a large crowd gathering around
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   him.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.800]   And as I looked out in the moonlight, I could see the dust of the olive groves lifting up.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.220]   And I knew a large crowd was coming, and I could tell that they were angry.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:17.280]   And at that moment, I knew, I knew Jesus was about to be betrayed by Judas.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.880]   He did it with a kiss.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.920]   Can you imagine it?
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.160]   Judas appears before Jesus with a big smile on his face, and he walks straight up to him
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.680]   as if he hadn't seen him for years.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.280]   And he says, "Rabbi," and he gives him a kiss on his cheeks.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.600]   The intimacy of a greeting, betraying the faithfulness of a friendship.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.760]   What happened next is hard to describe to you.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.520]   For me now, still, it seems such a blur.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.020]   But as Judas kisses Jesus, suddenly there's this sound.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.720]   These two soldiers emerge from the crowd with swords, and they arrest Jesus.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.640]   They take him by the arms.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.460]   Peter suddenly jumps up and makes a shouting sound.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.920]   And somehow there's a sword in his hand, and he's waving the sword around like a madman.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.520]   And he cuts off the ear of one of the soldiers.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.040]   Blood starts gushing out of his head.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.480]   And through that, the other soldiers in the crowd raise up their swords.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.840]   They start to charge forward.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.440]   And I realize that this is the moment of our death.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.080]   And right when things are the noisiest, a loud, commanding voice comes, and everything
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.720]   else silences around it.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.860]   Jesus says this.
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.480]   He says, "What, you think I'm leading a rebellion, that you would come against me with swords
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.440]   and sticks to arrest me?
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.640]   Don't you realize I've been with you in the temple courts day in and day out, teaching
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   your people?
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.160]   You never arrested me then.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:09:00.160]   So come and do what you have come to do, because the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.120]   It was painful to see what happened next.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.400]   But at the same time, one of the most majestic things I'd ever seen.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.920]   Jesus goes down to the ground and picks up the ear.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.040]   And he walks over to the man whose head was bleeding.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.640]   And with the most tender words I think I've ever heard Jesus say, he places his hand on
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.280]   his head and he prays.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.480]   The man's head is restored, his ear is remade, and he can hear again.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.800]   And the pain is gone.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.080]   I mean, I've seen many miracles that Jesus has done in our time.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   But this one, years later, I came to understand as one of his greatest.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.120]   I came to understand it because of the moment that it happened in.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.100]   I mean, could you imagine it?
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.000]   This is his worst hour.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.260]   He's just been praying to his God to take the power of the cross from him.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.440]   He's just been betrayed by one of his best friends.
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.840]   He's just been arrested by people who have a sword.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.280]   And in the midst of all of that, Jesus does something that I think none of us would have
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280]   done.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.520]   Certainly, that I would not have done in that moment.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.960]   In his worst hour, Jesus loved.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.120]   He loved.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.320]   Jesus responds to betrayal with the gift of love.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:36.520]   And I would come to understand that this gift of love would shape all the events that were
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:47.320]   to happen next.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:53.120]   In your hours of struggle and suffering in the garden, Jesus, you are truly here with
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.920]   us in flesh and blood, in heart and spirit.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:08.120]   You who endured the agony in the garden, you offer up prayers to him who is able to save
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:15.920]   you from death, learning obedience from the things that you suffer.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.840]   Oh, Jesus, in your readiness to suffer, that was tried and proven in the garden.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.840]   Have mercy on us.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.000]   Jesus, who was abandoned by the sleeping apostles.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.480]   Have mercy on us.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.800]   Jesus, in your love for us, that was not overcome in the garden.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.160]   Have mercy on us.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.120]   Jesus, in your goodness that was not embittered even in the garden.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.520]   Have mercy on us.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.080]   Jesus, in your courage that remained steadfast even in the garden.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.880]   Have mercy on us.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.160]   Jesus, in your meekness that did not falter even in the garden.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.760]   Have mercy on us.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.840]   Jesus, in your anguish and sorrow, in your fear and trembling praying in the garden.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.440]   Have mercy on us.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.800]   Jesus, who said, "Not my will, but yours be done."
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.560]   Have mercy on us.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.520]   Jesus, who knew the sins of the whole world in the garden.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.880]   Have mercy on us.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:27.960]   Jesus, who knew our sins and was willing to take all of this upon yourself in the garden.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.000]   Have mercy on us.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.440]   Jesus, who was the most abandoned of all the abandons, who loved every one of us sinners.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.880]   Have mercy on us.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.440]   Oh, Jesus, in the garden of olives.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.160]   Have mercy on us.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.520]   Spare us.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.920]   Deliver us from the evil.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.040]   From the sins that you wept for in this garden.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.520]   From ingratitude for your love.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.240]   From indifference in your suffering.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.160]   From resistance to your grace towards us.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.280]   From bitterness over our own bitter agony and suffering.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.840]   From doubt about God's love in our darkest hours.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.680]   From despair in our moments of abandonment.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.680]   Deliver us, oh Jesus.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.840]   We ask this, we give this, in your mercy.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.360]   Give us grace.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:27.720]   Lamb of God, grant us, grant that we may gratefully return the love which prompted you to endure
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.240]   your most holy sufferings in this garden of olives for us sinners.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.240]   Amen.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.640]   Isaiah 53.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:53.600]   Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.720]   He grew up before him like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.040]   He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him.
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.600]   Nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.920]   He was despised and rejected by mankind.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.520]   A man of suffering and familiar with pain.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.680]   Like one from whom people hide their faces.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:33.120]   He was despised as we held him in low esteem.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.200]   Of the hundreds of men that I have sentenced to death over my career, I actually do remember
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.960]   this Jesus that you speak of.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.240]   Not because of him though, of course.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.640]   No, he was inconsequential.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.960]   I remember it because it was a day that Herod and I became best friends.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.560]   I'd always thought Herod was a ghastly figure.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.720]   So masculine but lacking the nuance of intelligence that you need for leadership.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.960]   I would avoid him in social gatherings all the time because, you know, I wouldn't want
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.520]   to be associated with him.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.320]   But on this particular day, I actually needed an ally.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.360]   And to my surprise, Herod became one.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.200]   And in that, he proved to me that I was right.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.720]   They brought this Jesus before me, these chief priests and scribes of the law.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.380]   And they accused him of all of these crimes, saying that he had done heresies and subversions.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:30.000]   They told me that he was teaching people that they no longer had to give taxes to Caesar.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.080]   A reasonable crime, I admit.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.880]   But the one that actually intrigued me the most was when they told me that he was holding
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.040]   on to the claim that he was the king of the Jews.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.840]   Now, let's put aside one moment the fact that that is actually my title as governor over
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   Judea.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.760]   And let's just focus on the fact that these scribes and chief priests wanted to kill him
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.480]   because of this claim.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.560]   Now, I'm not Jewish, as you can probably tell by looking at me.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.120]   But I, as governor of Judea, have made it my place to learn about these Jewish customs
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.800]   and the quaint religious traditions they have.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.760]   I've actually read their scriptures and think that I know it better than some of them.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.600]   I knew they were looking for a messiah.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.440]   I knew they were excited for a king to come and rule them again, so that they could get
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:26.720]   rid of those nasty little Gentiles, to overcome the Roman Empire, and to establish a Jewish
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.040]   state forever.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.560]   But here is the irony for me.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:38.040]   One had finally come who was saying that he was the fulfillment of the prophecy, and they
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:44.360]   wanted not to enthrone him, but kill him.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.840]   Sometimes the things that you long for when they arrive become the things that you want
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.640]   the least.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:56.580]   Well, this Jesus was in my court, so I had to do something.
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.040]   So I took my most commanding voice and I said this.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.880]   I said, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.440]   It's quite effective, isn't it?
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:15.000]   His reply was this, "Yes, it is as you say."
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And that was it.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.800]   That was the extent of our conversation.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.760]   And I looked upon this man with pity.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.160]   He was no threat to the Roman Empire.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.600]   This man was not dangerous.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.120]   Certainly he wasn't a warring king that they wanted.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.600]   And so I said to them, I said, "I see nothing wrong with this man.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.840]   He's not done anything.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   He's not dangerous.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.080]   I see no crime in him."
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.940]   You should have heard their response.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.360]   They started shouting.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.740]   They started uproaring all over the place.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.360]   One of their law teachers came up to me personally, and he said, "Don't you understand that this
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:56.320]   man has come from Galilee all the way down to Jerusalem teaching heresy as he's come?"
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.920]   And now this was their mistake.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:05.960]   They told me he had come from Galilee and I am not the protector of Galilee.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.200]   I'm the protector of Judea.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.260]   Herod is the protector of the people from Galilee.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.400]   And so if they want to charge this man, it's not my responsibility, it's Herod's.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.000]   I told them to send him off to Herod and let's see what Herod would make of him, whether
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.680]   Herod would agree with me or not.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:31.520]   We sent Jesus off and to be honest with you, I thought that was the end of it.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:37.660]   I was wrong, which doesn't happen very often, but did on this occasion.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.680]   For at the end of the day, there was Jesus once again standing in my court.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.000]   This time though, he was wearing a red robe.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.040]   Herod had put a robe that mocked him as a king.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.160]   And it was a message to me, because what Herod was saying was, "I agree with you, Pilate.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.800]   I agree that this man is innocent.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.360]   I agree with you that he's not who he claims to be.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.200]   I agree with you that he's not the king that the Jewish people are hoping for.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.600]   There's no crime here," Herod was saying to me.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.120]   "Let him go."
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.960]   And off the back of Herod's thought and mine, I stood before the same crowd that I had stood
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.320]   before hours earlier, and I said, "There's no crime here.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   He's not a danger.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.000]   I will punish him and let him go."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.200]   At that moment, I have what I can only describe to you as a riot in my court.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.280]   It was so embarrassing.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.040]   Everybody started shouting, "Crucify him!
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.280]   Crucify him!
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   Crucify him!"
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.400]   And I kept on saying, "He's innocent.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.720]   I see nothing wrong with him.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   Crucify him!
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   Crucify him!"
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:49.320]   And the noise was so loud that I got to the point where I just wanted these Jews to shut
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.560]   up.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.240]   I realized that I had sent far more innocent people to their death than this Jesus.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:04.580]   And so I responded, and I said, "All right, if you want him dead, it's no consequence
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.580]   to me.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.680]   He can be dead.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   We can crucify him."
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.640]   And I told them, "I am a man of peace."
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:22.560]   And I realized that sometimes, you know, peace comes through the doorway of death.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:33.480]   Oh Christ, grant us understanding of your courage, strength, and patience in the face
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   of death.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:40.720]   Be with us in our own trials, and in our death, and in our life.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.760]   Jesus, you are the light that shines on in darkness.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.240]   The darkness has never mastered it.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.800]   Jesus, you are the King of glory.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.960]   Your glory is not to be served, but to serve.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.400]   Jesus, you are the King of love.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.360]   Your love is to give yourself a ransom for many.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.800]   Jesus, you suffer what looks like defeat, but emerge victorious.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.320]   Jesus, your power comes to its full strength in weakness.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:28.160]   We pray for those tasks to make.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.560]   We call upon you and your mercy to mediate and lead them.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.200]   Help our brothers and sisters to be true to what they themselves believe, yet to be ready
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.400]   to be led deeper into revelations about themselves, and to change their views and convictions
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:51.240]   by what you show them.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.280]   We pray for the victims of accident, malice, and violence.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.880]   Those who stand falsely accused.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:02.560]   Those bearing the burden of painful illness, whether physical or mental.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.060]   Those caught in intolerable webs of fear and perplexity.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.840]   Those feeling abandoned and forgotten in the dark.
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.120]   Those enduring the agony of bereavement, and of physical suffering, and of anxiety for
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:31.880]   the safety of their dear loved ones.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.280]   May Jesus, who passed this way himself, be known to all those suffering as the Savior
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.840]   who will bring healing and liberation.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.440]   And on this Friday evening, may you reveal to us the truth of who you truly are.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:56.360]   Amen.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.440]   He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:10.280]   He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.840]   so he did not open his mouth.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.640]   By oppression and judgment, he was taken away.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.560]   Yet, who of his generation protested?
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.680]   For he was cut off from the land of the living.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:35.740]   For the transgression of my people, he was punished.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.240]   I was once given the title, "The King of Death."
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.840]   Sounds rather nasty, doesn't it?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.040]   I thought it was quite fitting at the time, to be honest with you.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.840]   I was a centurion that was overlooking most of the executions that were happening in the
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.920]   Greek Roman Empire at the time, particularly those by the procouncil of Judea.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.200]   I was actually very good at my job.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.480]   We killed mostly criminals and political prisoners of the Roman Empire.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.140]   Now, here's how I did it.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:09.920]   I was actually so skilled that from nailing somebody on the cross to their death, it would
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.760]   only take about three hours.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.520]   I would use three nails in order to accomplish it, and in order for things to be efficient,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.600]   we would often crucify three people at a time.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:26.320]   I want you to think of this, three hours to death, three nails, crucifying three people
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   at a time.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.960]   It would actually be years later that I would come to understand the true significance of
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.920]   the number three in the death and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.560]   Jesus.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.640]   I didn't know him personally at the time, of course, but I had heard of him.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:49.200]   He was the only person the soldiers were talking about.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.800]   I remember walking into the praetorium, and there he was standing there wearing this scarlet
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.440]   robe.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.500]   We had been told that his crime that we were about to kill him for was because he was claiming
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.040]   to be a king, the king of the Jews.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:10.160]   We looked at him there, looking pathetic in his robe, the scorniness of him.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.760]   So we mocked him.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.960]   We spat at him.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.260]   I actually told my crew of men that they could do whatever they wanted with him.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.440]   Some of them gathered and formed a crown of thorns.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.320]   They came and they placed a crown of thorns on his head, and they pushed it down so hard
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:34.880]   that the thorns cut him, and the blood that poured down out of the marks went through
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:41.200]   his face, making little tracks of blood on his cheeks like evil tears.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.560]   We put a staff in his hand, and I instructed all of those who were in my company to bow
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:56.520]   down before him in mock worship and then stand up and hit him as hard as they could.
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:03.200]   After about 70 of them had done this, I judged that if it continued, he would maybe die in
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.920]   private rather than the shame of a public death that he had been ordered, and I told
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.460]   my men to back off.
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.700]   We stripped him of that robe.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:20.760]   We put his own clothes back on him, and then we led him out to be crucified.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:26.240]   I'm taking it in this room that none of you have ever nailed somebody to the cross.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   It's quite a skill, actually.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.080]   The reason why we beat up our prisoners is because we want them exhausted so that they
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.800]   do not fight what happens next.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:42.520]   We lie them down on the cross, and as they're held there by the soldiers, I take a heavy
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.720]   hammer and some big nails.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.480]   I drive the first one through one wrist, the second one through the other wrist, and then
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.040]   we have fashioned a special nail for the bottom part.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.640]   To get through both the bones of the ankles, we have to drive it in as hard as possible.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:05.040]   It is excruciatingly painful, and that, my friends, is the point.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:11.880]   I remember this Jesus, and I remember taking the nail and as I was banging it into him
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.400]   as hard as I could, I remember thinking, "Here's one who claims to be the Son of God.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.920]   I mean, would the Son of God put him through this?"
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.600]   I mean, if this person really was the Son of God, how did he end up in this situation
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.600]   in the first place?
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:34.520]   And I have to tell you, I enjoyed driving those nails into him.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.160]   Jesus did not die within three hours.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.840]   I have to say I admire his fight for life, but I'd seen this before and I knew death
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.880]   would finally come.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.960]   And at the ninth hour, I watch as Jesus shakes violently.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.920]   He then says something in a tongue that I do not understand, and then he breathes out
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.720]   his last and he dies.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.780]   He's dead.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:07.440]   And his death singles the end to my day.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:15.840]   And as I'm beginning to walk back to the praetorium, something happened that's hard to describe.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.800]   There was this shaking that happens around my feet.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.000]   When it first took place, I thought that maybe I was just dizzy.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.440]   I mean, I was famished.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.760]   I hadn't eaten for hours.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.320]   But as I looked down there and thought maybe I should sit down for a moment, all the ground
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.440]   around me began to shake.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.800]   And it began to shake so hard and I found myself falling down onto the ground and lying
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.680]   down and covering my eyes.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.940]   And as I peered out from my hands on the ground, I could see the rocks around me splitting
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.280]   and shaking.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:53.520]   And then I gazed over to the tombs of Golgotha, tombs where I had laid men many times before.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.120]   And you will think I'm lying, but I actually saw dead men come out of those tombs, still
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.000]   wearing their grave clothes.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.120]   One walked straight past me where I was lying.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   And in the midst of all of this, a darkness comes, a darkness that I cannot explain to
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120]   you.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.320]   I've never experienced such darkness in the world before.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.280]   And I am absolutely terrified.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:28.020]   And then suddenly, almost as quickly as it had began, suddenly it stopped.
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.860]   And silence descended again.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.260]   And brightness came back to the world.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:40.340]   And from lying where I was, I looked back up at the cross and Jesus was still hanging
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.260]   there and he was still dead.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.780]   But as I looked at him, I saw him differently.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.380]   He himself was not different.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.920]   I saw him differently.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:02.860]   I realized that he was not a liar.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.740]   I can't tell you how I understood it.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.620]   But what I had just experienced and what I had just seen, there was no other explanation
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.460]   for it.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:20.420]   And as I looked up at him, I realized that I had just killed someone who actually was
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.860]   the person he claimed to be.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:29.400]   And in that realization, I realized that I was the one responsible for setting my men
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.940]   on him and beating him up, for mocking him for the king that he actually was.
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.220]   I was the one responsible for banging in the nails that brought him excruciating pain.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:45.620]   I had been the one that had stood there for hours on hours hoping for his death.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:58.500]   And as I looked at him, what I saw was not his face, but mine.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.460]   I saw myself on that cross.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.820]   I saw myself hanging there.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:10.820]   I saw all of the things that I had done for years and years, the things that I had covered
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:20.400]   up in false pretenses of power, the things that I had done to people that were not right.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.300]   And as I looked at him, I saw myself and I realized it was me who should have been there,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:31.620]   but this one had taken the place where I should have been.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:37.260]   And in realizing that, guilt came over me like a wave.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:46.620]   And I felt so cut up inside that I had been the one responsible for killing him.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:52.140]   I remember turning to the soldier who was lying next to me.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:32:02.940]   And as our eyes met, I said these words, I said, "Surely this one actually was the Son
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:14.820]   of God."
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:21.860]   Our Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, we kneel before your blessed cross.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.400]   We open our hearts to contemplate your holy sufferings.
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.620]   We pray we might receive more deeply in our hearts all you did and suffered, and that
[00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.100]   we might realize whom it was you suffered for.
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.700]   May your grace be with us, the grace that shakes off the coldness and indifference in
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:44.700]   our hearts, so that we may dwell with you in love, sorrow, and gratitude.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:53.620]   In the Lord's hearts, may your crystallized love embrace our poor, weak, and weary hearts.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.500]   Fill us now with an awareness of you.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.940]   Stir up within us what we need so badly, compassion for you, love for you, honesty
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:08.820]   and faithfulness, and perseverance to contemplate your holy death on the cross.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.620]   Let your death on the cross, the greatest act of loving kindness, penetrate our hearts.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:39.420]   Right to its very core, right to its very center, that we might truly understand.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:48.460]   Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.460]   by him and afflicted.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.020]   But he was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.900]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:07.100]   The punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:11.260]   We all, like sheep, have gone astray.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.940]   Each of us has turned to our own way.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:23.420]   And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:30.180]   Joseph had invited me to help him take Jesus' body down from the cross.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.020]   Seemed like a fantasy to me that he was dead.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:38.460]   I mean, just days before I had met him in the night in secret.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:43.740]   As a Pharisee myself, I was keen to understand his understanding of the Torah.
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.180]   And I asked him, "Can you explain the law to me?
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.060]   How do you teach it?"
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.020]   And over hours, Jesus said the most beautiful things.
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:58.460]   I mean, he opened up the scriptures to me in ways that I had never encountered before.
[00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.060]   It was almost as if he wasn't interpreting the law.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.460]   It was like he was embodying it.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.300]   It was like he was almost fulfilling it in the way that he spoke.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:14.860]   I mean, the hours just passed away, and eventually the sun was beginning to come up, and a new
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.860]   day was breaking.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.180]   And I said to Jesus, "I want to learn more.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.060]   I want to sit under your teaching more."
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.500]   And we had to arrange a time for me to go back and visit him.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:34.100]   Now here he was, dead on a cross, his body filled with blood.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.340]   Joseph had been given permission to remove his body, and he'd invited me to come because
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.780]   we thought the authorities might change their minds.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.820]   And so we took Jesus' body as quickly as we could, and we laid him down in a chamber that
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.820]   was nearby.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:53.320]   And as we placed him down, we enacted a traditional Jewish burial.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:58.980]   We got some warm water, and we began to wipe off the blood from him as much as we could.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:04.220]   Very gently, I removed the crown of thorns that had been placed on his head, not wanting
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:09.720]   to scratch or cut him anymore, even though he was dead.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.580]   I had prepared spices, as is our tradition in a burial moment.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:20.540]   I actually had prepared 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes.
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:25.180]   Months later, I would reflect about the irony of that moment.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:31.260]   The myrrh that I had gathered to anoint him in his death was the same spice that the magi
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.900]   had brought him at his birth.
[00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:41.140]   The scent that had welcomed him into our world would now be the scent that would carry him
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.820]   to the next.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:52.100]   The way that we do it in our tradition is we take little strips of linen cloth.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:58.980]   And these strips of linen cloth we bring to the spices, and we mix it in and build it
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.580]   into the spices just like this.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:07.720]   And the spices give off a fragrance that represents what is happening in this moment.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:14.660]   We take the fragrant linen strips, and we place them carefully, wrapping them around
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.700]   the body itself.
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:22.580]   And we wrap it around all of the body, from head to toe, covering it completely.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.380]   And Joseph and I, we did this in reverence and awe.
[00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.500]   We did it in complete silence.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:33.580]   These strips are representative of an honor of a life that is lived.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:39.660]   And what we were doing is providing some grave clothes, grave clothes that we believe Jesus
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:45.860]   would wear for all eternity.
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:51.740]   Just a few weeks later, Joseph and I would be sitting with the disciples, having a conversation
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.020]   with the risen Christ.
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:00.020]   I remember after that, Joseph and I sitting together, and we looked back on the moment
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.300]   where we wrapped him in the linen strips.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.400]   And we talked to ourselves, and we realized that what we were doing took on a profound
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.980]   meaning that at the moment we didn't understand.
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:16.340]   But we weren't just in that moment taking linen cloths in a Jewish burial rite and wrapping
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.300]   him like we always did.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   Instead, the reality of what was happening dawned on us.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:28.380]   What we were doing was really taking strips of sin.
[00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.620]   And we were taking strips of sin, and we were wrapping his body with it.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:40.540]   For it had been our sin, my sin, your sin, that had brought him to the place of his death.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:45.060]   That the strips we were placing around him was like we were covering him in a sin of
[00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.060]   humanity.
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.820]   That the wages of sin is death.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.100]   And those strips represented far more.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:58.300]   They represented the grip of death that had now taken him to his grave.
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:03.220]   And as we wrapped it around him, we thought that that was it.
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:07.260]   Death clothes forever.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.820]   And I was so glad that we were wrong.
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:17.860]   I would often gather with Peter for months, and I would ask him to tell me the story of
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:21.540]   the time when he and the women ran to the tomb.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.780]   And Peter will get this big face of excitement.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.620]   And he'll say, "We ran into the tomb with the women, and we didn't see Jesus' body.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:30.700]   His body was not there.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:40.100]   What they saw was Joseph and my linen strips folded neatly in the center of the tomb."
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:47.260]   It was as if Jesus was saying that grave clothes are only worn by the dead.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:53.100]   It was like he was saying that these strips of sin are now discarded, set aside, dealt
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.100]   with.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.620]   He was saying, "I no longer need to wear humanity's sin anymore, for sin has been overcome.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.580]   Death has been killed."
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:11.020]   And I remember seeing him on the day when he ascended to be with his father.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:17.880]   Joseph and I were standing together, and Jesus said these last words to us.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.940]   And then he starts to ascend, and it's hard to describe to you what it was like.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:28.780]   But as he ascends up into heaven, suddenly we can see that he's not wrapped in anything
[00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.780]   of linen at all.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.340]   And I remember Joseph turning to me in that moment, and he says, "Do you see what he's
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.740]   dressed in?
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.780]   He's dressed in righteousness.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:43.140]   He's dressed in robes of righteousness."
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:48.820]   And we come to discuss it amongst ourselves, that we now too, in our relationship with
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:53.560]   the risen Christ, in our relationship with the one that no longer wears the grave clothes
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:59.120]   of death, but who has shed those clothes for us, the one who's no longer on the cross,
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:06.980]   but is alive with us, he now puts new garments on us, that you now are not wearing death
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.660]   anymore, that death no longer has the final say in your life, that the clothes that he
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:18.100]   now wraps you in are also robes of righteousness.
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.540]   Not your righteousness, but his.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.900]   His given to you because of what he did on the cross.
[00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:27.900]   His given to you because he is raised from the dead, so that we would know that we also
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.940]   rise.
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:34.820]   And we don't just rise at the end of all things when he returns, but we rise now, dressed
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.380]   in clothes of righteousness, to be his hands and feet, to a broken world.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.180]   We saw in that moment, as he ascended to heaven, what would happen for the church as it would
[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:53.300]   ascend in its glory, to serve those who were broken and lost and hurting around them.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:42:00.580]   So on this Good Friday, as like Joseph and I, you come to consider what it is to wrap
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:06.700]   Jesus in the sins of your linen cloth.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:14.860]   For you know that that brought him to death, so that he could overcome death, so that you
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.500]   could be brought into life.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:27.220]   Jesus did this so that you might do this to a broken and hurting world.
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:33.540]   Rise up and be the resurrection of Christ for a world that desperately needs it.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.140]   Let me pray for you.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.700]   Let's pray.
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:45.420]   Father, we are so grateful, so grateful for your cross, so grateful that tonight we've
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:51.460]   been able to gather around the beauty and the wonder of your resurrection that comes
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:43:00.940]   after the profundity of you in the garden, you in the trial, you on the cross, and you
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.580]   in the tomb.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.020]   And Father, I want to pray that as we've opened up that story in each of its segments for
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:13.780]   everybody here tonight, I pray now you would come and meet with them as they take their
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.740]   own time now to journey to your cross once more.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:23.660]   Father, we're thankful that our sin has been dealt with.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:28.760]   We're thankful that we no longer wear grave clothes.
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.660]   We're thankful that in your resurrection we have been given new life.
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:45.060]   But on this day, on this Good Friday, we soberly come to your cross again, recognizing that
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:50.220]   we still at times try to wrap linen cloth around you again.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:58.520]   And Father, we come to you now, asking you to meet with us in this moment.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:05.680]   Father, for those in this room that are carrying things that they need to give to you tonight,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:12.600]   I pray you would come by your Spirit now and lead them.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:18.880]   For those of us aware of our sin, may you recognize that that's the Holy Spirit at work
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:25.320]   in you, welcoming you to a beautiful place of grace.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:34.880]   Father, as we now come to your table, as we celebrate your death and resurrection in communion,
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:40.600]   Father, we ask that you would now come and remain with us, draw us close.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.920]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:51.480]   Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.920]   Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.720]   Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:10.640]   Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.520]   In these stations, there will be two things that we want to invite you to do.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.960]   The first is there'll be communion available for you.
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.880]   I want to invite you in your own way and in your own time to take communion, to take the
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.480]   piece of bread and to take the cup.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.240]   And as you pray and consider what it is to come to the cross tonight, you would take
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.960]   communion for yourself at the cross.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.080]   The other thing we want to do is encourage you to symbolize what we've been talking about
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.800]   tonight.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:45.280]   There's a linen cloth, a strip of linen that we've cut for every single person here.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.440]   I want to invite you to do something that will help you over this weekend to continue
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.600]   to reflect about what we've been talking about tonight.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:57.840]   I want to invite you to take a linen cloth and to take one of the bowls of the spices
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:03.360]   and just to put the cloth in the spices like I did earlier.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.600]   The reason why you do that is because we want you to carry around that scent with you over
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.000]   the next 48 hours or so.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.960]   And what we're going to invite you to do once you've dipped it in the spices is just to
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.880]   twist it up a little bit.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.100]   And if you've come with someone tonight, you can invite them just to help you to tie it
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   around your wrist.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.560]   And as you tie it around your wrist, what you're going to be doing is wearing a bit
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:29.640]   of the grave clothes of Jesus upon you over the next 48 hours or so.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.720]   We want you to wear it because we want you to stay in a place of reflection between Friday,
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.280]   Saturday and Sunday.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:42.320]   The fragrance of the strip will remind you of the fragrancy of what Joseph and Nicodemus
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.960]   did for Jesus on that moment.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:50.640]   Wearing it will remind you of the sin that placed Jesus on the cross and will give you
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:57.360]   some time over the next 48 hours to just spend that time with Jesus in reflection on sin.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.520]   And then if you're going to come back here on Sunday, which we highly invite you to do,
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:06.120]   we will take some time on Sunday to cut off the strips that we're wearing as we celebrate
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.580]   the risen Jesus together on Sunday morning.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:16.240]   So a place for you to take communion, a place for you to take a linen strip.
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.760]   And I want you to do this in a place of prayer and reflection.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:24.520]   There's no time limit that we have here, but once I sense that we've all partaken in this,
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:30.400]   I'll come back and we will close our service together in a time of prayer.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.480]   But as we move into this moment, let me pray once more.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:38.480]   Father, I just ask that you would now move powerfully amongst us as we come forward in
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:46.600]   our own time, in our own way to take communion and to wear some grave clothes in reflection
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   of you.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.000]   And we pray you would meet us by your spirit.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.020]   We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.640]   As you feel led by the spirit, please do come forward.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
