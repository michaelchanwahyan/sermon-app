[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.760]   Everyone says, amen, amen.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.040]   Have a seat.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.160]   I'm so excited to be with you this morning.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.080]   My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.320]   So if this is relatively one of your first times at The Vine,
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.200]   we're so glad that you're here.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.560]   I'm really blessed.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   Sandra's in the house here today.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.040]   Sandra and John founded The Vine,
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.160]   led The Vine for many years.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800]   Thanks for being with us, Sandra.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.640]   We love you.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.680]   Justine is back.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.160]   So nice to see Justine as well.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.920]   And I know that there are so many other people
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.960]   that are visiting with us.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.560]   Joe, my mate from the UK, sounds so British, doesn't he?
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.120]   You love him.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.920]   Yeah, mate, yeah.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.480]   But we know also you may be new as well.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.000]   So grateful to have you with us.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.920]   We're in part two of a three-part series on justice,
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.560]   and in particular, on God's heart for justice.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.000]   And what we've been saying over these weeks
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.440]   is that what we're teaching in you last week,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.960]   this week, next week, are foundational messages
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.800]   for who we are as The Vine.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.200]   We feel here at The Vine that we've been called
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.280]   as a church to put justice in God's heart,
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.960]   to justice and for justice,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960]   at the center of what we do as a community.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.040]   And so if this is your home already,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.600]   or if this is going to become your home,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.920]   then you're gonna hear us talk a lot
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.000]   about the realities of the poor and the broken
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.320]   and the vulnerable in our society,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.640]   in our city, in the situation that we're here with.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.200]   And we're gonna challenge one another
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.880]   to be the church to the city that is around us.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.120]   And so last week, as we started this series,
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.160]   I started by giving you a theology of justice.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   I wanted us to really understand
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.440]   how justice sits at the heart
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.560]   of the biblical redemptive narrative
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.400]   that we have in Scripture.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.640]   And so we literally went from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.280]   unpacking the idea that the gospel,
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.560]   and this is really important, church,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.680]   that the gospel is not just the restoration
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.920]   of my relationship with God, as important as that is.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920]   That's certainly a central part of the gospel.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.120]   What we see in Scripture,
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.760]   that the gospel is the restoration
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.560]   of not just a broken relationship here,
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.360]   but also a broken relationship here.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.160]   That if the gospel truly brings shalom,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.440]   then the gospel has to rectify
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.520]   the four broken relational contexts
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.320]   that we see happen in Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.920]   And we looked last week, didn't we,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.960]   that in Genesis 1 and 2, God creates humanity
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.400]   as the pinnacle of his heart,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.800]   labels humanity as the image of God,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.280]   and then defines for humanity what is right and wrong.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.200]   We said last week that God is the one
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.480]   who defines for us what is right and wrong.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.040]   And then God creates four relational contexts
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.720]   by which we express the right and wrong of the Father.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.200]   That's our relationship with God,
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.680]   our relationship with ourselves,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.960]   our relationship with others,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.040]   and our relationship with creation.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.920]   So in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.560]   we see these beautiful relational contexts created.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.080]   And at the end of Genesis 2, God stands back from that,
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.640]   and he says those words, doesn't he?
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.320]   He says, "This is shalom.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.160]   This is the way things were meant to be.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.280]   The world is now designed and is flourishing
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.240]   in the way in which it was created to be."
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.000]   And then of course, we saw Genesis 3,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.640]   the intaking of sin, Satan's tricking of humanity
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.520]   to think that they shouldn't just be image of God,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.480]   but they can be gods themselves.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.240]   And in taking that fruit, what we see straight away
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.520]   is that humanity now begins to define
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.200]   what is right and wrong.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.600]   Where in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.280]   God defines what is right and wrong,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.120]   in Genesis 3, humanity begins to take on the ability
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.680]   or thinks that it has the ability
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.760]   to define what is right and wrong.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.600]   And we said last week that when humanity defines
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   what is right and wrong rather than the divine,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.160]   we will always define it in a way that benefits ourselves.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   Like myself, not you.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.800]   Like I will define it in a way
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.080]   where I will have an advantage over others
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.800]   and where there'll be self-preservation.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   So last week we saw Adam throwing his wife
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.320]   immediately under the bus.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.360]   When God shows up,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.240]   that brokenness of relationship begins to happen,
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.000]   and we begin to create right and wrong
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.640]   in the way that we want it for the benefit of ourselves.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.200]   And injustice is born.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.040]   And then we saw, of course,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.640]   that God begins to restore this
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   through the calling of a nation, Israel through Abraham.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.880]   We saw that importance of justice and righteousness,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.880]   the reality that those things work together
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.080]   within that nation, and yet also the idea of wickedness.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.120]   And we said last week, didn't we,
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.560]   that the wickedness or the way of injustice is wicked.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.440]   And the wicked in the Old Testament,
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.680]   basically are willing to disadvantage the community
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.840]   for the advantage of themselves.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.360]   Whereas the justice and righteous
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.520]   are willing to disadvantage themselves
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.480]   for the advantage of the community.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.720]   And so you get this beautiful picture
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.920]   in the Old Testament of what scripture calls us to
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.400]   in this idea of justice,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.920]   but it's just beginning to be modelled for them.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.040]   And then we see the Exodus,
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.760]   and in the Exodus is that model that begins to happen.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.240]   God takes his oppressed people in compassion.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.880]   He advocates on their behalf.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.200]   Then he acts to bring them out of their slavery,
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.240]   and he provides for them that great place
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.760]   of future flourishing in the promised land.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.000]   And so we see the Exodus story as God's model.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.920]   He's beginning to show his people
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.040]   what this justice journey can look like.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.600]   But again, we saw in the Old Testament
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.440]   that there is this cycle of injustice,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.320]   that even though God is beginning to model it,
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.440]   even though God is beginning to redefine
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   the right and wrong for his people,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   the people are so steeped in sin,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.280]   it so easily has entangled them,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.240]   that they realise by the end of the Old Testament
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.320]   that they can't do it.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.920]   They can't fix that relationship with God.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.960]   They can't fix the relationship with themselves.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.640]   They can't fix the relationship with others,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.640]   and they certainly can't fix the relationship
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800]   with the broken world around us.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.040]   And so there's this crying out
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.000]   at the end of the Old Testament, right?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   There's this desire for God to step in
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.720]   and do what only God can do,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.640]   'cause humanity cannot do it.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.840]   And then Jesus, this beautiful incarnation,
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.920]   fully God and fully human,
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.760]   the spoke that is driven in that wheel of injustice
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.000]   to borrow Dietrich Bonhoeffer's beautiful picture.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.880]   And Jesus, because he's fully God and fully human,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.760]   he is the spoke 'cause he's fully God,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.240]   but then he's able to deal with sin 'cause he's fully human.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.600]   And being those two things together,
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.400]   he begins to model for us a new way.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.080]   Again, advocacy, again, work in action with his miracles
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.920]   and the way that he serves and he teaches.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.400]   And then that moment on the cross,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.280]   the moment on the cross where he gives his life
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.480]   so that we might know the fullness of life,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.440]   where he pays that price for the redemption of our sin,
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.600]   the blood poured out, the sacrifice once and for all,
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.000]   so that sin no longer has the final say.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.400]   And then in his resurrection,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.000]   the creating of a new community, the church,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.240]   a community that he fills with his spirit
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.840]   and sends out into the world to now be his hands and feet,
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.320]   to disciple the nations,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.680]   to bring them into a new way of thinking.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.040]   And all of the New Testament centers this
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.320]   on this idea of the gospel,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.600]   that the gospel is not just about the restoration
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.880]   of my relationship with God alone, as central as that is,
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.200]   but as that relationship is also then healed and restored.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.480]   Then I have a restored relationship with myself.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.920]   I no longer consider myself a slave,
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.440]   but I am a child of God.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.320]   I then have a restored relationship with those around me.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.000]   I've been brought into a family together
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.160]   and now there is peace amongst us as a community.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.320]   And then because creation has been groaning,
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.760]   but now it will no longer groan
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.680]   because Christ on the cross has paid the price
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.360]   and creation itself longing for its own redemption.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.840]   And the gospel, if it is the gospel,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.480]   if it is a gospel that brings shalom,
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.720]   if it's a gospel that deals with the brokenness of sin,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.480]   can't just fix this.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.440]   It has to also fix this, fix this and fix that.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.400]   That's the whole gospel.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.920]   That was all last week in about five seconds for you.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.360]   Okay, so if that was helpful for you,
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.200]   or if you're like,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.680]   I need to understand that a little bit more,
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.680]   can I invite you to go back last week
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.000]   and have a listen to that message?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.800]   But basically that's what we taught.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   There's a biblical mandate for justice.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.920]   It sits at the heart of the gospel.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.720]   It's the restoration of all of those broken contexts.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.400]   So now we stand here in week two,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.360]   and here's the question we should all be asking.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.800]   If that is true, how should we now live?
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.160]   Like, how do I now live in this world if that's the gospel?
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.280]   If we here at the Vine are gonna say,
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.000]   we're people of the gospel,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.400]   if I'm saying that being a person of the gospel
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.920]   is to be involved somehow in the restoration of four
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.760]   of those relational contexts, how do I now live?
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.400]   Like, what should be my agenda?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.960]   What should be my priorities?
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.080]   Like, what should I be focused on in the here and now?
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.400]   I'm not just waiting till I die to go to heaven.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.160]   Like, I've got something to do now.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.720]   God's peeled the curtain back at the end of all things
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.520]   in Revelation 21 and 22.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   And he's shown us a picture of every knee bowing,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.240]   every tongue and tribe confessing.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.040]   He's shown us a picture where sin is no longer present,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.320]   where the leaves of the trees are for the healing,
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.440]   where there's that one tree of the tree of life,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.400]   no more the tree of the knowledge of the new.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.600]   He's peeled it back, and he's saying to us,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.880]   live on behalf of that vision now.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.920]   So if God's heart is the restoration of all things,
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.760]   the renewal of all things, if God's heart is justice,
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.240]   how should we now live?
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.000]   I wanna challenge us by saying this as direct as I can.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   You cannot call yourself a Christian
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.640]   and remain distant to the injustice in society around you.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.640]   You cannot call yourself a Christian
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.000]   if you're not on behalf of the gospel.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.480]   And if the gospel is the restoration
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.520]   of all of those broken relational contexts,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.600]   and if justice sits in the heart of that,
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.520]   and if that's where God is taking us
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.080]   at the end of all things in Revelation 21 and 22,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.560]   if we're not on behalf of that now,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.640]   you should stop calling yourself a Christian.
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.680]   Because being centered in Christ
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.240]   means that I am centered in a context
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.040]   by which it is painful and dying and hurting,
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.720]   and sin is doing stuff in it.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.560]   And I stand as a person with Christ in humility,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.600]   knowing I'm not the answer for everything.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.840]   The world is never gonna be perfect until Christ comes back.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.880]   We're living in this now, but not yet,
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.520]   but that does not mean I'm mute.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.080]   It does not mean that I haven't got something to say.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.960]   It doesn't mean that the gospel is to wait until he returns.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.040]   No, the gospel has action now.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.840]   And this call upon us as a people of Christ
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.680]   is a wonderful thing.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.520]   Paul, when he writes to the church in the New Testament,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.480]   have you ever noticed this?
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.640]   Right at the start of the letter,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.800]   he doesn't just say this as it's like a greeting thing.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.360]   He says, "You are in Christ in Ephesus."
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.080]   Or he says, "You're in Christ in Colossae,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.480]   "in Christ in Philippi."
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.280]   It's basically Paul's way of saying,
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.160]   "Don't you realize that your relationship with Jesus
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.080]   "is not just in Christ, you're in Christ in a context.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.360]   "You're in Christ in a city.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.800]   "You're in Christ around a whole bunch of people
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.080]   "that are desperately in need of the gospel.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.600]   "You're in Christ in Corinth, in Christ in Philippi."
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.840]   And I wanna say to you, if you live here in this city,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.440]   you're in Christ in Hong Kong.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.200]   Not just in Christ, as amazing as that is,
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.960]   but God has planted you here in Hong Kong.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.000]   He did not do that by mistake.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.800]   None of you, whether you're here for two weeks,
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.680]   two months, two years, two decades,
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.760]   are here in Hong Kong by mistake.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.600]   Our city desperately needs the gospel.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   There are injustices at work around us.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.800]   And if we're gonna call ourselves a Christian,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.240]   we're gonna realize that our relationship with Jesus
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.400]   has something to say to our context.
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.520]   I'm in Christ in Hong Kong.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.960]   That should mean something.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.920]   I had the privilege a number of years ago
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.240]   of meeting with one of my justice heroes.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.400]   His name's John Perkins,
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.560]   and John Perkins was a contemporary
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.720]   of Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.320]   and was very involved with the civil rights movement
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.200]   in the '60s.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.880]   And he was speaking to a small group of us pastors
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.120]   at this conference I was at,
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.800]   and he said this incredible thing.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.600]   He said that the church of Jesus is always at its best
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.400]   when it is a community of hope,
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.680]   wrapping its arms around a community of pain.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:54.240]   And if we're in Christ in Hong Kong,
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.560]   and if we're the people of the gospel in this city,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.040]   then we should be asking ourselves,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.120]   we have the hope.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.000]   And we just sung about it.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.520]   The joy of the Lord is our strength.
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.440]   Not our great ability to sort out
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.320]   all the problems in the world,
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.800]   not our wonderful strategies.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.280]   No, our strength is the joy of the gospel.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.760]   The fact that we have been reconciled to God,
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.600]   reconciled to ourselves,
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.440]   reconciled to others,
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.560]   reconciled to creation.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.640]   And we have that message for everyone.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   And that should motivate us.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.200]   That should put something inside of us.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.880]   That should ask us to go,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.040]   okay, we are the community of hope.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.240]   I get that piece.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.560]   What's the pain?
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.320]   Because if we're to be a church
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.000]   that's wrapping its arms around the pain,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   we need to know what is the brokenness?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.480]   What is the injustice?
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.520]   What is the suffering?
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.840]   What is the pain around us
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.880]   that we can wrap ourselves around?
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.120]   So what I wanna do is just share with you
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.560]   just some like high level ideas about that for us
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.560]   and for our city.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.120]   And I wanna do that in the framework
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.920]   of this idea of us and God,
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.680]   us and ourselves, us and others,
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.760]   us and creation.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.680]   Let's start with us and God.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.120]   This one should move your heart immediately.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.720]   Latest government statistics would say
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.840]   16% of our city believe Jesus,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.800]   have a relationship with Jesus,
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   or would call themselves Christian.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.320]   16%.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.280]   Now, if you just look at people
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.160]   who regularly attend church on a Sunday,
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.520]   well done, thank you, you're here,
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.800]   that drops to 8%.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.040]   Now, this is a statistic
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.160]   that should really move your heart.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.680]   84% of our city do not know Jesus, 84%.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.000]   The church has been in Hong Kong for over 100 years.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.080]   I mean, even longer than that.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.320]   I mean, there's 1700 registered churches
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.960]   in our city right now.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.600]   And 84% of the people in this city don't know Jesus,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.640]   that should burn something inside of you.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.960]   That should place a holy discontent inside of us.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.120]   That church is not about some holy huddle
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.360]   coming in and experiencing
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.560]   what we've experienced here this morning,
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.920]   as great as that is.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.320]   And we love gathering here.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.640]   But if this is all it is,
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.680]   that 84% is not gonna change.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.520]   What we do when we gather here
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.840]   is we are sent ones.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   We come and we worship and we experience
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.040]   and we weep and we cry and we pray
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   and we fill ourselves with love
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.440]   so that we then go and serve
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.520]   the context we have been placed in.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.080]   That 84% should do something in our spirits.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.040]   What about us and ourselves?
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.520]   One of the things that we've noticed recently
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.840]   is the mental health related issues in our city
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.920]   more than anything.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.800]   And what you can see here is that
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.760]   one in six people in Hong Kong
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.400]   have what's called common mental health challenges.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.280]   One in six adults in our city.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.160]   When you break that down to just youth,
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.920]   six years old to 17, that's one in four.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:42.960]   60% of the global suicides in the world happen in Asia.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:48.400]   Hong Kong ranks third on a list, on that list.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.960]   That's a list we do not want to be ranking on.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.680]   We rank third on that list,
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.360]   only behind South Korea number one, Japan number two.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.800]   Last year or in 2023,
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.320]   there were 1,092 suicides in our city.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.160]   That should do something to us.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.200]   On the mental health side,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.040]   the WHO organization would tell you
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.040]   that you need about 10 psychiatrists
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.240]   for every 100,000 people.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.120]   Hong Kong currently has 4.1 psychiatrists.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.560]   I don't know what the .1 is, that's weird.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.240]   But anyway, 4.1 psychiatrists
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.080]   to every 100,000 people in our city.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.240]   UBS did a research report recently,
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.880]   and they looked at the average working hours in Hong Kong.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.200]   Hong Kong has 50 hours of average work week.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.440]   The global average is 36 hours.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.320]   I want to plant a church in one of the cities
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.840]   where 36 hours is the, come on church.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   We live in a city that is driving its people
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.200]   way, way too hard.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.680]   What about us and others?
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.120]   This is really important that we understand
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.000]   the poverty context of our city.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.120]   20% of Hong Kong people
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.360]   live below the poverty line in this city.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.640]   We always think Hong Kong is a wealthy place.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.520]   That's one point, almost 1.4 million people
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.760]   out of 8 million live under the poverty line
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.440]   here in Hong Kong.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.560]   When you take the poorest person in Hong Kong
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.760]   and the wealthiest person,
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.880]   there's an 81.9X kind of difference between the two.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.480]   Now, here's the crazy thing.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.440]   When you did that statistic in 2019,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.160]   that difference was only 44%.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.440]   So in the last, what, five years,
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.400]   it's gone from being a 44% difference
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.160]   to an 81.9% difference.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.560]   In other words, Hong Kong is getting further apart
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.600]   between the wealthy and the poor.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.600]   The Gini coefficient is a global standard
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.560]   to help to kind of signify the wealth-poor gap.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   Hong Kong's current Gini coefficient is 0.54.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.480]   Zero would be perfectly equal, one being the worst.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.560]   We're right in the middle, 0.54.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.880]   But hear this, that puts us in the top 10
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.920]   of places in the world
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.000]   in terms of the gap between the poor and the wealthy.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.800]   Right now, it takes 5.3 years on average
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.600]   for somebody to get into public housing in Hong Kong.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.720]   200,000 people in our city
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.640]   are living in less than 100 square foot.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.880]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.000]   Special education needs.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.240]   A lot of children in our city
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.760]   are struggling under disability or special education needs.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   Currently, right now, there are 50,000 people,
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.240]   children, that will require
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.240]   at least 12 therapy sessions a year.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.960]   That's a total cost of $430 million,
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.400]   and most of that money is not being made available
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.480]   in the public sector.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.560]   Now, this should shock us when we realize
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.480]   that Hong Kong's current financial fiscal reserves
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.080]   is $724.8 billion,
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.560]   which will increase to $983 million by 2028.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.160]   That's the prediction.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.880]   In other words, our issue is not resource.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.520]   It's distribution of that resource.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.280]   And what about finally us in creation?
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   Have a look at this.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.040]   Hong Kong currently produces around about 4 million tons
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.080]   of what's called metropolis,
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.880]   it's kind of like metropolis social waste
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.720]   or something like that.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.640]   But it's basically the waste that we create,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.400]   4 million tons of it,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:13.000]   of which on average is 1.44 kg per person per day.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I'm glad to report that Singapore is higher at 1.88 kg
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.560]   per person per day.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.520]   But the joke hides the reality
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.640]   that we're still one of the highest.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.800]   That places us within the top 20 cities in the world.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.480]   Now, here's the thing that should really wake us
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.400]   as a church, as a community.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.400]   1.3 million tons of that is food waste alone.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.680]   A third of our waste is food waste.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.280]   What that means is that we love to eat,
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.400]   we love to order everything on the menu,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.040]   and we do not eat it all.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.840]   I'm gonna say that one more time
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.760]   'cause some of us, myself, needed to hear this.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.200]   We love to eat, we order everything on the menu,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.120]   but we do not eat it all.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.160]   And when we're giving a third of our waste is food,
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.680]   that needs something for us to be really thinking about.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.560]   On the positive side, I wanna say this.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.240]   The government has done some great work
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.360]   in the area of recycling and are continuing
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.200]   to do a good work in the area of recycling.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.640]   Right now, about 32% of our created waste a year
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.800]   is recycled here in Hong Kong.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   That's not where we want it to be overall,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.840]   but that is much better than the less than 12%
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.400]   some five years ago.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.000]   So Hong Kong has done a good job,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.920]   and the government have some policies in place
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.080]   to try to change the recycling dynamics of our city.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.800]   In terms of pollution, 20 days last year,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.400]   we're dedicated as like dangerous levels of pollution.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.120]   We're currently ranked about 63rd, I think it is,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.520]   out of a global index of 138 countries
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.520]   when it comes to pollution.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.280]   So pollution continues to be a challenge in our city.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   Now, the reason why I wanna show you some of those things
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.120]   is because that's really important that we understand
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.680]   what is the pain that we need to be wrapping
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.000]   our arms of hope around.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.680]   But when we see statistics like that,
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.920]   it would be easy for us to feel a bit despondent.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.280]   It'd be easy for us to feel like,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   well, that's like a lot of bad stuff.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.320]   I don't know how to respond to those statistics, Andrew.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.160]   I don't know what to do.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.960]   I'm feeling pretty weighed down by it.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.800]   And oftentimes what happens for us
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.200]   when we hear stuff like this
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.520]   is that we retreat further rather than press in.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.120]   And I wanna say that, yes, the statistics are quite strong,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.400]   but we have to hear this.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.880]   We are the community of hope.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.280]   Like if anybody has the answer to this,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.560]   then surely it's the local church
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.520]   and its partnership with the many NGOs
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.040]   that do great work in our city.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.360]   That should be the starting point for our thinking.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.720]   Yes, these statistics are shocking
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.000]   and they should shake something within us,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.800]   but not shake us to despondency, shake us to action.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.200]   They should make us wanna stand up more,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.000]   want us to be more Christian in our city,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.800]   want us to live the hope of the gospel more.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.640]   Now you have to understand that for justice to happen
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.720]   in areas of injustice in society,
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.320]   basically sociologists will tell you
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.480]   that four things need to happen.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.480]   Education, connectedness, adaptability, and resource.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.560]   These four things are central to any transformation
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.200]   of any brokenness in society.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.280]   Education, connectedness, adaptability, and resource.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.560]   What we have to understand is that we're living in a time
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.640]   where all four of those things
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.440]   are the best that they've ever been.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.120]   So if these are the four things that are helpful for us
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.640]   when it thinks about changing society
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.440]   and doing something right within the society around us,
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.920]   we gotta realize that those four things,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.040]   I mean, we've never been more educated
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.360]   as a generation than right now.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.880]   Our access to education and to information
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.040]   has never been higher.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.800]   In fact, all the statistics I just showed you
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.640]   on the screen, I got from AI.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:55.080]   Now I want you, I checked the sources, okay?
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.880]   So it wasn't just like hallucinating AI, okay?
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.000]   These are good statistics from AI, but I went to AI.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.040]   I mean, we're the most educated generation
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.400]   there has ever been.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.160]   We have access to information like never before.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.960]   What about when it comes to this idea of our connectedness?
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.280]   We're more connected than we have ever been before.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.800]   Now, yes, there's a whole thing around being more connected,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.240]   but never feeling more alone.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.560]   That's a whole nother sermon we'll come to at some point.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.240]   But the reality is we're more connected amongst each other.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.200]   We have the ability to connect like never before.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.440]   Adaptability, because we have this education
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.800]   and connectedness, we are people of the world
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.640]   more than we've ever been in terms of global citizenships.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.160]   We understand culture and background and people
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.600]   better than ever before.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.640]   We understand the ways in which different nations operate
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.560]   better than ever before.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.840]   So we are more adaptable to the realities of our world
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.720]   than we've ever been.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.000]   And finally, resource.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.560]   I mean, you just saw in even the statistics for Hong Kong,
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.080]   our issue is not resources.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.760]   Incredible amounts of resources.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.800]   There's more resource generated in the world
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.160]   than in any other time in history right now.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.440]   But that resource is not going to the places
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.600]   where it necessarily needs to go.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.480]   So here's the thing.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.600]   While we might want to be despondent,
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.080]   we are actually better equipped now to rise up
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.520]   and do the things that we can do to begin to shape the world
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.560]   to the gospel like never before.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.320]   The question then is how.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.600]   How do we do it?
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.640]   Like we know we've got, follow me, follow me.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.680]   We've got a theological mandate to do it.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.000]   The gospel tells us we should be doing it.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.760]   We know that we are in Christ in context
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.640]   and we've been planted here in Hong Kong.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.680]   We've seen that there is pain
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.280]   and we are called to be a community of hope.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.320]   How do we do it?
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.160]   Like how do we do it?
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.680]   Not just on a corporate level, like an institutional level,
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.720]   like a church level.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.440]   How do you do it?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.640]   Because every single one of us in this room,
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.680]   we have a spirit of influence
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.680]   where there is some injustice currently at work.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   Some of you, it might be your family.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.360]   Maybe there's a breakdown in a relationship
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   in your family right now
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.880]   and it's causing a lot of suffering and pain
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.320]   within the broader family dynamic.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.280]   Maybe for some of you, it's a school that you attend
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.600]   or a university you're a part of
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.560]   and you see some things happening there
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.000]   that break your heart.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.960]   Maybe you're working for an organization or a corporate
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.720]   and you know that there are practices happening
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.320]   within your business that you know is creating a bigger gap
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.160]   between the wealthy and the poor.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.000]   Or whatever it might be,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.960]   for all of us it will look different,
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.000]   but every single one of us,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.160]   we are in Christ in that company,
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.640]   in Christ in that family,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.480]   in Christ in that context,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.320]   and we have to do something.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.200]   What is it that we do?
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.480]   Okay, so to help you,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.680]   I wanna just, in the time I've got left,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.440]   just show you a really short, quick model
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.800]   of how we can actually live more justly
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.280]   based on what we've been talking about.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.360]   And I wanna do it, of course,
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.560]   by looking at Jesus and this moment in Jesus's life.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.280]   And I think in this moment in Jesus's life,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.080]   Jesus models for us how we can approach our context,
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.160]   our sphere of movements,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.480]   whatever justice issue might be there for us.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.200]   And in this beautiful moment of Jesus's life,
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.000]   he shows us four things that he does.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.240]   And I'm just gonna break these down real fast.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.400]   This is out of, I'm gonna turn back to it.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.560]   It's out of Luke chapter 19.
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.560]   This is his triumphal entry as he enters into Jerusalem.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.680]   Notice what it says here.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.360]   This is Luke 19, starting in verse 41 to verse 44.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.600]   As Jesus approached Jerusalem,
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.000]   he saw the city and he wept over it.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.240]   And he said this,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.440]   "If you, even you had known on this day
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.720]   "what would bring you peace,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.000]   "but now it is hidden from your eyes.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.280]   "For the days will come upon you
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.920]   "when your enemies will build an embankment against you
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.720]   "and encircle you and hem you in on every side.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.160]   "They will dash you to the ground,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.040]   "you and the children within your walls.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.360]   "They will not leave one stone on another
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.960]   "because you did not recognize
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.080]   "the time of God's coming for you."
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.440]   This is a significant moment in Jesus's ministry.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.520]   We know from the scriptures
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.960]   that Jesus had a long relationship with Jerusalem.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.640]   In fact, he was there at eight days old meeting there
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.400]   and Simeon and Anna prayed over him, prophesied over him.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.520]   We know that he was back there for his bar mitzvah
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.400]   when he was about 13,
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   where he stayed behind at the temple
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.600]   and his parents lost him, a nightmare for them.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.800]   And he had to be in his father's house, that whole thing.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.160]   But we also know that from the beginning
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.520]   of his actual ministry,
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.160]   Jesus has specifically stayed away from Jerusalem.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.520]   He's been ministering in Galilee and Samaria
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.400]   and the surrounding areas,
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.920]   but he's been staying away from Jerusalem.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.480]   And he's been staying away from Jerusalem
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.560]   'cause he understands that when he gets to Jerusalem,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.760]   things will begin, things will precipitate
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.280]   towards the cross.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.720]   And he knows because of that,
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.520]   he needs to make sure that he does the work
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.400]   that he's been called to do before he gets there.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.800]   And so the turning point in the gospel of Luke
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.280]   is when Jesus says to the disciples,
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.320]   "Who do people say I am?"
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.800]   And the disciples respond, they say,
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   well, Peter responds, he says,
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.520]   "You're the Christ, you're the Messiah."
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.880]   And then Luke records for us
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.480]   that it was from that moment
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.560]   that Jesus sets his face towards Jerusalem,
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.280]   walking, wanting to now be and reconnect with his city.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.160]   And here Luke describes the moment
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.840]   where Jesus crests up the hill of Mount Olives
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.520]   and looks upon his city for the first time
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.880]   in what was probably a number of years.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.080]   And it says here, he does four things.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.120]   I wanna show you what these four things are
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.320]   because these become the kind of nucleus
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.720]   of a model for justice for each one of us.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   The first thing Luke says is that he approaches.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.560]   Now that might sound like not a big deal on itself,
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.320]   but I want you to think about this.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.680]   Jesus, again, he understood that when he gets to Jerusalem,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.400]   things are gonna kind of happen
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.760]   that will lead him to his death.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.800]   He understands that when he gets there,
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.760]   the people in the triumphal entry
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.560]   who were shouting, "Hosanna, Hosanna,"
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.280]   would later be the ones that would be shouting,
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.920]   "Crucify him."
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.440]   He knew that what he was about to say
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.120]   and do around the temple
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.960]   was going to basically give people the excuse
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.000]   that they needed to try to get him hung on a Roman cross.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.320]   But Jesus still approaches.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.320]   And this is really important
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.840]   because Jesus understands the pain that is about to come,
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.960]   but he doesn't stay away.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   In other words, Jesus makes a priority of proximity.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.680]   He says, "I'm gonna come to this city now
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.360]   at the right time and the right way,
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.320]   but I'm gonna approach it
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.000]   even though I know it's gonna be painful,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.600]   even though I know it's gonna be hard,
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.120]   even though I know I'm gonna get rejected,
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.040]   even though ultimately it's gonna lead to my death,
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.400]   and everything inside of me would want me to stay away
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.160]   and just judge Jerusalem from Galilee.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.440]   I'm not gonna do that."
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:31.320]   And he puts himself in a place of proximity with his city.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.880]   For some of you, there's a justice issue,
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.760]   an injustice in your family,
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.560]   an injustice in your workplace,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.640]   and it scares you to think
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.200]   that you might need to be involved in it.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.160]   And that's understandable
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.120]   'cause these things can be tough and scary.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.880]   But what Jesus models for us immediately is proximity.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.200]   The whole gospel is a relationship gospel.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.760]   And one of the things that Christians are really bad at
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.800]   is talking on behalf of the poor
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.520]   without knowing any of the poor.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.040]   Talking on behalf of the vulnerable,
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.360]   the trafficked, the marginalized,
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.680]   without even knowing any of them,
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.600]   having never met them, having never seen them,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.320]   having never put themselves in a place
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.600]   of understanding their suffering and their pain,
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.040]   but just standing back and saying,
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.600]   "Well, I guess I should speak for them."
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.080]   But then we speak for them in dangerous ways.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.280]   Jesus draws near.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.200]   Some of you, it's gonna be painful to draw near,
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.440]   but we have to always put proximity over productivity.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.800]   Productivity without proximity leads to pain.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.440]   But when we are close, when we approach,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.360]   we find ourselves in a place
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.520]   where we can begin to do something.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.680]   What does Jesus do?
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.040]   Well, the next thing it says is that he sees Jerusalem.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:53.320]   I love this because at first, this is physical.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.360]   He's just come up and he's crested the Mount Olives
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.280]   and he looks upon it and said,
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.400]   now what he would have seen, I've actually done,
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.720]   you can go to Jerusalem
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.960]   and actually do the walk that Jesus did.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.840]   And you go up there and you see the olive trees
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.880]   that are still there around the area of Mount Olives.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.080]   They're still there to this day.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.520]   And then you can look on the view that Jesus had.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.200]   And it's relatively similar.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.240]   There's still the walls of the old city there.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.040]   There's the old city on Mount Zion.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.960]   There's the, now it's a mosque, of course,
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.440]   but in Jesus's day, there was the temple right there.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.160]   So you can kind of get a sense of what Jesus was seeing.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.080]   And he crests and he physically sees what's before him.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.200]   Now, what I've done for you here in this message
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.840]   is I've enabled you to crest a hill
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.600]   and physically see some things
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.320]   that are happening in Hong Kong.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.200]   Statistics, stuff that's important for us to be aware of,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.760]   stuff happening in mental health in our city,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.280]   stuff happening in the pollution index and all that stuff.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.640]   So all that stuff we went through,
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.760]   that was us physically seeing what's happening in our city.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.920]   Does that make sense?
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.320]   Now, here's the thing though.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.840]   If that's all we do, just physically see
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.560]   the stuff that's happening in our city,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.200]   educate ourselves and get good statistics,
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.320]   that's all helpful.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.560]   But if that's all we ever do,
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   we're no better than a secular NGO.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.360]   The thing that makes us Christians
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.960]   is we do what then Jesus does,
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.560]   which he doesn't just see physically,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.040]   but he sees spiritually.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.280]   'Cause he looks over his city physically,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   but then he sees prophetically
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.920]   what's gonna happen to that city in 70 AD.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.480]   He sees Emperor Nero coming in
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.320]   and destroying many of the Christians,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.440]   killing many of the people.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.560]   And he says, "If only you knew the peace
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.920]   "that comes before you now,
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.720]   "but it's hidden from you."
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.640]   So he doesn't just see the physical realities,
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.200]   he sees the spiritual stuff
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   and not just the spiritual bad stuff,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.480]   but also the spiritual good stuff,
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.120]   the hope that is there.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.360]   And what we're modeled here by Jesus
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:45.160]   is that we're called to approach,
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.040]   be proximate, be in relationship,
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.600]   but we're also called to see physically,
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.960]   educate yourself, learn about the issue,
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.800]   know the statistics, but then pray and say,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.720]   "Lord, what breaks your heart?"
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.000]   Because I see that there are 60%
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.560]   of the global suicides in Asia,
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.640]   and I see that Hong Kong is third on that list,
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.920]   and that does something to me.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.040]   But Lord, I come to you
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.440]   'cause I wanna see this issue from your eyes now.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.160]   I wanna get a burden in my heart
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.280]   for what breaks your heart.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.160]   We sang it earlier, didn't we?
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.320]   Give me a heart that is after your heart.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.880]   That's the seeing spiritually, not just physically.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.680]   Otherwise, we're no better than a secular NGO.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.520]   And we're the church that has the hope of the world
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.840]   and the gospel of life.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.160]   Then Jesus does this next thing.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.680]   Luke describes him as weeping.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.640]   He weeps.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.080]   Now, the Greek word that Luke uses is kaleo.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.760]   It literally means loud wailing or big sobbing.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.600]   Like, in other words,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.400]   Jesus has not crest that hill
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.200]   and look at Jerusalem and go.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.080]   He crest that hill,
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.720]   and remember, he's surrounded by people,
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.280]   and he starts wailing.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.640]   And I can imagine him shaking his fist
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.680]   and he's crying.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   Maybe he falls to his knees.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.560]   We don't know exactly what happened,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.680]   but there's a kaleo taking place in this man.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.560]   He's not just wiping away a couple of tears.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:10.280]   He is publicly travailing for his people.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.720]   He's feeling something inside of him
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.640]   for their pain, their suffering, their struggles.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.720]   A man who's about to experience the greatest pain of all,
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.400]   he's first kind of on his knees
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.160]   on behalf of people that are suffering.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.040]   This is the idea of empathy.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.440]   I want you to see this because this is really important.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.680]   When we approach and we see,
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   and if we stop at see,
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.760]   what we've experienced is sympathy.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:40.680]   Yeah, Andrew showed some statistics today
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.080]   about suicides in Hong Kong.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.800]   Man, yeah, I'm kind of bummed about that.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.880]   You know, like that's not great.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.920]   Yeah, man, I'm glad I know that now.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.200]   But that's just sympathy.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.240]   Jesus moves from sympathy to a place of empathy.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.400]   Empathy is like, I wanna feel what those parents have felt
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.800]   when their child has killed themselves.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   I wanna feel what those that are trafficked
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.760]   into our city are feeling in terms of what's going on.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.480]   And they're like, I wanna have some.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:10.720]   And look, you cannot have empathy unless you approach.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.760]   Are you following this?
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.280]   You can't have this unless you've done a bit of this.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.880]   You've gotta understand the issue,
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.200]   but then you've gotta make sure that you feel it.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.360]   This is where prayer also becomes very important.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.200]   We weep.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.240]   Now that doesn't mean some of us
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.520]   will actually literally weep,
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.960]   but we can weep in our spirit.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.480]   There's a holy discontent inside of me
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.920]   that this world is not as Christ would want it to be,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.120]   that there is not the shalom
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.760]   that Jesus died on the cross for.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.200]   And that moves me, that does something to me.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.480]   And I cry out in that place of pain
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.560]   to the one that can only fix it.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.480]   So this weeping of Jesus was central
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:51.440]   to this work of justice that he was about to do.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.480]   But notice, he then speaks.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.600]   Now this is really great,
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.520]   'cause eventually Jesus then after weeping,
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.280]   after approaching and being proximate,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.120]   seeing physically and spiritually and empathizing,
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.840]   he then moves into what I would say is compassion.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.640]   See, empathy without action is just empathy.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.040]   Empathy with action is compassion.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.080]   It's like we've taken this place of empathy
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.520]   and we've begun to actually do something, work something,
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.160]   say something, be something, act in a certain way,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.840]   suddenly have different consuming habits,
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.000]   suddenly recycle more at home.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.520]   Whatever it might be, it might be a small thing
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.360]   or a big thing, but we've begun to,
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.720]   hey, I've approached this issue,
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.440]   I've seen it physically and spiritually,
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.040]   I've felt something for it,
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.960]   there's something in my spirit that's not right about it.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.840]   I've brought it to Jesus, I'm praying,
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.480]   but I'm also now going to speak, act, do something
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.160]   that aligns myself to being a person of the gospel,
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.520]   one that restores all of those break-on relational contexts.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.680]   That's what I want to do.
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.120]   So Jesus provides for us, I think, simply and beautifully,
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.320]   this model that we can all apply into our lives,
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.000]   whether it's a big issue or a small issue,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.960]   something in our family, something in our workplace,
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.040]   the first thing we should do is I want to approach.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.920]   But here's the problem a lot of Christians make,
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.120]   the mistake we make, we approach
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.840]   and we jump straight to speak.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.480]   Oh, we love to do this as Christians.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.200]   Like we like to show up somewhere and approach something
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.000]   and just tell everybody what we think about it.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.840]   I tell you what, there is a lot of damage
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.760]   that has been done over church history
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:28.240]   by Christians that have approached really important issues
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.800]   and just begun to speak
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:33.040]   and have bypassed what Jesus models for us.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.600]   Jesus didn't just approach his city
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.800]   and begin to declare something over them,
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.920]   even though he had every right to do so,
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.640]   Jesus shows us something.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.200]   Now, here's the next thing though,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.760]   a lot of Christians might approach
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.040]   and then educate themselves about the issue
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.440]   and then they jump straight to speaking.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.080]   That's even worse because this one is ignorance.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.960]   And there's some damage that can be done through ignorance,
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.040]   but I tell you what, this is judgment.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.480]   And a lot of damage is done
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.040]   through the church through judgment.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.160]   'Cause it's like I've approached, I've learned,
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.520]   I've seen there's a physical, there's a spiritual,
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:10.240]   and now let me tell you what God thinks about your sin.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.360]   Let me tell you what God thinks about your brokenness.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   And we become a church that wags its finger.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.600]   Jesus doesn't show up to his city
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.240]   and he's got some pretty strong things to say to them.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.200]   He's about to go to the temple
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.280]   and like whip people around, okay?
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.920]   Like this is not safe, cuddly Jesus time.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.440]   He's got some strong stuff to say,
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.600]   but I want you to see something.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.280]   He does not approach, see, and then jump straight to speak.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:37.840]   Jesus weeps, he feels something.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.720]   He allows to put himself in the pain of the people
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.760]   that he sees spiritually.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.960]   He feels that emotion inside of him so that he knows,
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.560]   man, this is what the pain is like.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.320]   This is what the brokenness is like.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.280]   Man, I'm not gonna stand from a distance
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.800]   and judge with a finger.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.720]   I'm on my knees 'cause I feel it with them.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.760]   I feel the longing inside of them for their freedom.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.960]   Lord, would you bring them free?
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.000]   But notice also, Jesus doesn't just stop at the weeping.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.840]   I think we do this as a church as well.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.760]   Oh, we come in on a Sunday, Lord,
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.000]   Lord, save our city.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.400]   And then we never share the gospel with anyone.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.920]   See, the problem is we can get paralysis by analysis.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.240]   Are you with me?
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.800]   And we can get paralysis by being over-emotional.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:33.040]   Jesus goes all the way through that and then he speaks.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   He allows the thing to impact and affect him.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.600]   And then he stands up and he says,
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.760]   oh, Jerusalem, that only you knew.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.600]   And then he begins to act in ways throughout the whole week
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   that would reinforce the gospel
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.960]   that he's bringing the hope of the world.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.520]   And then he goes to the cross and then he rises
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.560]   and he changes everything.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.960]   My friends, whether you have a problem in your family,
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.880]   whether you see an injustice at work,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.720]   whether there's something in those statistics
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.960]   where you're like, I wanna learn more about that.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.200]   Can I say that this applies to it all?
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.320]   Don't be distant.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.800]   Educate yourself, but don't forget to pray.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.840]   Feel what it is that's going on for the people of our city.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.160]   Learn from their perspective, hear their voices,
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.760]   understand their pain.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.280]   And then by the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:26.080]   do what he calls you to do.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.680]   Approach, see, weep, speak.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.920]   When we do that, we begin to show the world the whole gospel.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.680]   Amen, amen.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.600]   [congregation applauding]
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.400]   All right, can I invite you to stand?
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.720]   I wanna pray for us here this morning.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.240]   I wonder whether you just quiet your heart,
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.840]   open your hands,
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.920]   just allow the Holy Spirit just to speak to you.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.120]   Lord, I wanna pray that you would show each person here
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.360]   just one thing in their sphere of influence.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.840]   Maybe some of you in this room,
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.480]   you know what it is immediately,
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.080]   where there's an injustice around you
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.280]   that you know the Holy Spirit might be wanting to use you in.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.160]   But perhaps for many of us, we're not aware immediately.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.080]   Just take a moment.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.840]   Come Holy Spirit, come.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:20.120]   Father, I pray that you would speak.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.200]   I pray that you would show.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.960]   Lord, I thank you that every single person here,
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.800]   they're not perfect.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.680]   They're not gonna have all the answers
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.040]   or they're gonna make mistakes along the way.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.120]   I've made plenty.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.400]   But Lord, I pray that they would approach, see, weep,
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.120]   and speak with courage and boldness
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.360]   as your Spirit leads them.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.120]   Lord, I pray that this would change those statistics
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.920]   that we looked at today.
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.360]   Lord, we're not satisfied with just 16% of our city
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.360]   knowing you.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.400]   Lord, would you bring revival in Hong Kong?
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.800]   Lord, we're not satisfied with the mental health issue.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.760]   We had a viral pandemic.
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.960]   We have a mental health pandemic now.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:14.120]   Lord, would you do help us to be people who weep
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.200]   with our brothers and sisters
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.840]   that are struggling in this time?
[00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.120]   We thank you for work like Oasis
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.560]   and other things that the Vine does to help in that space.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.680]   But Lord, would you give us a fresh voice?
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:28.000]   Father, I wanna pray particularly for the weeping
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   for people in this room.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Not a weeping that leads to sorrow, that leads to retreat,
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.480]   but a weeping that is a godly sorrow
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   that catalyzes into action.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.440]   And Father, as we find that within us by your Spirit,
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.320]   not made by our own strength,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.040]   Father, we thank you that empathy moves to compassion.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.040]   And we thank you that in whatever area
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.920]   that you might be leading us into,
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.800]   we can play a part for the whole gospel in our city.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.960]   Lord, I pray that this would be a fire lit for the Vine
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.320]   in the season that we're in.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.760]   May it be for your glory and your glory alone.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.280]   And everyone here says, amen.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.120]   Amen.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.720]   (gentle music)
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.320]   (gentle music)
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.040]   (man vocalizing)
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:30.040]   [MUSIC]
