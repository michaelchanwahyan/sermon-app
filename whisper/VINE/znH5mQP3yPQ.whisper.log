[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   At the beginning of all things, there was simply darkness, nothingness, a void over all of the world.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   And in this darkness, there was a sense of expectation.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   The Bible describes it as the Spirit of God hovering over the darkness, waiting to bring it to life.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And then, four words were spoken.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   "Let there be light."
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And with those four simple words, a command, and suddenly, the darkness was broken.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And a light came into the world.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And lightness covered the darkness, and life started.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And with that creative moment of light, God made a declaration.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   He said that there is purpose and intent to creation.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   That there is a reason why He has made the world.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   The light represented the thought in God's heart that with light comes life, and with life, intent and purpose and goodness.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And suddenly, the darkness was no more.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   A command of God, and everything changed.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   But then we have a problem.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Because just after those moments, humanity then gets involved.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And humanity, as it often does, changes things.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And humanity taking from that tree of the knowledge of the good and evil,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   a place that they were not expected to eat,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   where they were commanded to leave alone, they grabbed.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And suddenly, they were brought back into darkness again.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   A darkness perhaps not literally over the earth, but a darkness upon the person.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   A darkness and a stilling, if you will, of the soul.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   A darkness in relationship between us and God, us and ourselves, us and one another, and yes, us and creation.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Literally, Adam and Eve, after they had taken the fruit, they recoil from the light of the presence of God.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And the first act of them in the garden as God returns to them after they had taken the fruit, was to retreat into the darkness of creation.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And humanity, if we're honest with ourselves, has been retreating into the darkness of creation ever since.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   In fact, the Bible, for the rest of the Old Testament, uses the metaphor of darkness and light.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   This idea that while we are now captivated as humans in a place of spiritual and relational darkness,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   there is the ability for God to continue to bring His light.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Throughout our Old Testament scriptures, darkness and light is played together in poetic metaphor.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   The darkness of hatred, but the light of love.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   The darkness of injustice, but the light of God's grace.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   The darkness of our sin, and yet the light of a God who forgives and redeems and restores.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And the Old Testament prophets begin to pick up this idea of light and darkness,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   to begin to speak prophetically of a hope that is to come.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   The prophets understood that there was no way in human skills and strategies to get out of the darkness back into light.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The only way the darkness could be pierced, the darkness could be broken, is if God brought His light to the world again.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   So the prophets began to speak of a day, of a time in the future, not too distant,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   where God would break into the darkness once again with His eternal light.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   That the light that comes in this time would never be extinguished.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   This light would be for the life of all humans forever, an eternal salvation of His people.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So the prophets spoke of this light all the time.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Let me give you one beautiful example from Isaiah chapter 9.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Isaiah says this,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   "The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   On those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   For to us a child is born.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   To us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And so in the present place of darkness there was a prophetic voice of hope.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That one day somebody would come, described by Isaiah like a child,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   to those who are walking in darkness.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And when that one comes, darkness will be no more.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   700 years later, after Isaiah's prophetic word, a new day indeed dawned.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Jesus, born to an impoverished family in a small town on the outskirts of Jerusalem,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   in a dirty stable, Christ's light appeared.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And light is the wonderful theme of the whole of the Christmas story.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   As we've travelled through Advent together as a church, we've seen this theme time and time again.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The light of the angel appearing to Mary to tell her that she will be pregnant.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The light of the angels appearing to the shepherds, overwhelmed as they were,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   declaring the glory of God and the birth of the Son, Jesus.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And a light, of course, in the sky for those Magi's in the east,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   following that star right to the place where Jesus was born.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Light dominates the Christmas story.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And essentially it's because what we see is the greatest light is not in the sky,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   it's not some angel, it's a fragile human child.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   The person of Jesus, wrapped up in cloth, laid in a dirty stable,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   is the greatest light that this world has ever known.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   In Jesus we have this profound message of Christmas.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   That God was willing to come to a dark place with the light of his salvation,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   so we may know true life.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   That's the wonder of Christmas.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   That's what we've been singing and celebrating over this month,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   what you've been doing on Friday night, and hopefully what you celebrated yesterday
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   with your friends and family, that a light has come so we would know true life,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   salvation, redemption and glory, forgiveness of sin, redemption for one another.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   That's the beauty of Christmas.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   But here's the thing, when we think about Jesus as the light of this world,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   it is not just a declaration that he's like some light that we're drawn to,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   that he's some light of eternal salvation that makes our lives better.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   As wonderful as that is, that's not the full picture of saying
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   that Jesus is actually the light of the world.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   What we are actually seeing at Christmas is more than that.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Jesus is not just a light that draws people towards salvation,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Jesus is the light that illuminates everything else.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   That Jesus is a light, if you will, is not just one that shines towards salvation,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   it's a one that shines out into the world,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   so that the darkness would be revealed for what it truly is.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   When we say that Jesus is the light of the world, what we're actually saying is this,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   that in Jesus we have not just the light that gives us the source of all life,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   but the source by which all life can be seen.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Are you with me?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Maybe you're not.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So let me explain this scientifically for you.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Light, literally, is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths that are visible to the human eye.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Is that helping with you now?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Electromagnetic radiation wavelengths visible to the human eye.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   They're actually 400 to 700 nanometers in length, in diameter.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   In other words, they're some of the smallest things in the world that are actually visible to us.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   These electromagnetic wavelengths travel at the fastest speed that anything in the world travels.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   They travel at 186,182 miles per second.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Not just miles per hour, miles per second.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Nothing in the world travels faster than that.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And what happens is, your ability to actually see, your ability to be able to perceive anything,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   is because these electromagnetic wavelengths are zipping all around the world at all times.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   They're bouncing off objects, and as they bounce off objects, they go into your eyes,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   your brain processes it, and you see something.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   So here's Ivan.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And even in the darkest of days, Ivan is a wonder to look at.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   He's a good looking guy, right?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Electromagnetic wavelengths are flying at Ivan all the time, they're bouncing off of him,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   they come into my eyes, I process it, and I see the glory that is Ivan, right?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   That is the wonder of sight.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Darkness, therefore, is the absence of light.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   You all know that, don't you?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   But think of it scientifically.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Darkness is the absence of electromagnetic wavelengths bouncing off things,
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   going into your eyes and processing something to enable you to see.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And if you're anything like me, and you grew up in Hong Kong,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   trust me, you do not know darkness.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Are you with me, Hong Kong people?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   We don't have darkness in Hong Kong.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   In Hong Kong, you have daytime, and then slightly less dark, or slightly less bright nighttime,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   is basically what we have.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Because we have light pollution everywhere in Hong Kong, don't we?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So you know what it's like when you get to the end of your day,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and you turn off your light in your bedroom,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   kind of is a little bit dark, but you can still see stuff in your bedroom and stuff.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   That's not really dark, my friends.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Trust me, if you want to know dark, move to New Zealand.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   My wife is from New Zealand, okay?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And I did not understand darkness until she took me to New Zealand.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   She took me to her family's home.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   It's a place called Hamilton.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   It's classified a city in New Zealand, but it's basically like a small village in England.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   But it is this place.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And we go there, and she takes us to her childhood home.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   And we had a wonderful day.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   This is my first time in New Zealand.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   We had a wonderful day with her family.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   We get into her bedroom at night.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   We get into the bed.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   We were married, just want to make it clear.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   We get into the bed, and we have our lights on by the side of the bed, as we often do.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   We did a bit of reading.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   She turned off her light.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I turned off my light, and I was like, "Ahhhh!"
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Because for the first time in my life,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   it was pitch black.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   It was the same blackness, whether my eyes were open or closed.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Like, it was completely black.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   There was no light anywhere.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   There was the absence of electromagnetic wavelengths.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   They were not flying anywhere in New Zealand in that time, okay?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   It is super dark.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Who's experienced darkness like that, right?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Yeah, it's crazy when it's that dark.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I was like, lying in bed.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   After I'd gotten over the panic, I was lying in bed, experimenting,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   and I had my hand in front of my face.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And I couldn't see it until it touched my nose.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And it would freak me out.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   "Where's my hand? Ah!"
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   When Jesus, in John 8, 12, says this,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   "I am the light of the world.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Whoever would follow after me would never walk in darkness,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   but would see the light of life."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   He's actually saying two things.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   He's saying, "Yes, I am the light of this salvation.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I am the light of your hope.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   If you come to me and bring me your sin,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I will redeem you and set you free."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   But he's also saying, "If you come and follow me,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   if you have relationship with me,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   you will never walk in darkness."
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Why? "Because through me, I illuminate everything in this world."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   In other words, if you want to see the world as it truly is,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   as it should be, as I want you to see it,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   you cannot see the world clearly
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   unless you're in relationship with me, is what he's saying.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   That there is darkness around there,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   but if you follow me,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   I will bring that darkness to life,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   and you will see as you should truly see.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   You see, without light, it is impossible to see.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Without Jesus, you will never see clearly or well.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Are you with me, people?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Jesus is not just this salvation to get our sins forgiven
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   so we get into heaven at some point.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Jesus is also the revelation
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   that through relationship with him,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   we can begin to see things as they truly are.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Jesus is not just the gift of life,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Jesus is the illumination of life.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   He enables us to see the world and life
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   as it truly should be seen.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   The wonder of Christmas
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   is that we have a light that has come into this world
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   so that we get salvation,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   but also we get to look at one another
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   and truly see each other through the light of Jesus.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Trust me, when I see you through the light of Andrew,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   you look pretty dark.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Just being honest with you.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   When I look into a mirror
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   through the eyes of darkness in Andrew,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   it looks pretty grim.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   But when I look at you through the light of Jesus,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I've never seen more better looking people
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   than I've ever seen in my life.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   When I look into that mirror through the light of Jesus,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I do my best to see this beautiful boy,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   this wonderful guy,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   forgiven and redeemed.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Are you with me?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   So when we say that Jesus is light,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   what is it exactly that he's illuminating for us?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   What is it this Christmas time
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   that I think Jesus wants you to see really clearly?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Well, that's the question
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   that our Christmas story answers.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And we've been spending our time in Luke during Advent,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   but I want today, this morning on Boxing Day,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   to go to Matthew.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And I want to read you Matthew's story
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   that happens immediately after the birth of Jesus.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   In other words, for Matthew,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   he gives us this story to tell us
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   this is what Jesus illuminates.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Jesus is born, comes into the world,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   and his light illuminates things.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And in this story, Matthew shows us
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   three ways that Jesus illuminates life for us.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I want to read this to you.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Matthew 2, verse 1.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   during the time of King Herod,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   the people of the East came to Jerusalem
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   and asked this question,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   "Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   For we saw his star, a light, get this,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   in the sky on the East,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   and we have come now to worship him.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   When King Herod heard this,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   he was disturbed, and oh, Jerusalem with him."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I love this.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Basically, this is saying when King Herod is angry,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   the rest of the city trembles in fear
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and anticipation for what he's going to do.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Verse 4, "When he called together
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   he asked them, 'Where is this Christ to be born?'
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   'Oh, in Bethlehem of Judea,' they replied,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   'for this is what the prophets have written,'"
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   and they quote from Micah,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   "'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   for out of you will come a ruler
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   who will be the shepherd of our people, Israel.'
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Then Herod called the Magi secretly
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and found out from them the exact time
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   when the light had appeared.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   He sent them to Bethlehem and said this,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   'Go and make careful search for this child,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   for as soon as you find him,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   report to me so that I too may go and worship him.'
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   After they had heard the king,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   they went on their way,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   and the star led them all the way from the east,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   all the way to the place where it stopped over,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   the place where the child was.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   When they saw the star,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   they were overwhelmed with joy.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   On coming to the house,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   they saw the child with his mother Mary,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   and they worshipped him.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   When they opened their treasures
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and presented with him gifts of gold and incense and myrrh,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   and having been warned by a dream
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   not to go back to Herod,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   they returned to their country by another route.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   When they had gone,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   an angel, a being of light, if you will,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   appeared to Joseph in a dream.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   'Get up,' he said.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   'Take the child and his mother,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   and escape to Egypt.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Stay there until I tell you,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.'
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So he got up, took the child with his mother,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   and during the night they left and fled for Egypt,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   where they stayed until the death of Herod.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And so it was fulfilled
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   what the Lord had said through his prophet,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   'Out of Egypt I called my son.'
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   he was furious,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   and in its vicinity,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   who were two years and under,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   in accordance with the time that he had learned from the Magi.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   A voice is heard in Ramah,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   weeping in great mourning,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Rachel weeping for her children
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   and refusing to be comforted
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   because they are no more."
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   It blows my mind
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   that Matthew follows the story of the birth of Jesus
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   with a story of what happens
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   immediately after the light comes into the world.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Here's what happens.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Darkness tries to overcome it straight away.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Immediately there's this story of pretty big darkness.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I mean Christmas is a time to celebrate Christmas.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   It's a time to find joy.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And yet immediately the darkness tries to fight back.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And Matthew here is trying to show us
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   the beauty and the wonder
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   of what the light of Christ truly shines on.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   First of all, it's a light that shines on ourselves.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   What Matthew does is he sets up a tension
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   and a contrast between Herod and Joseph.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   In this passage.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   He shows us Herod
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   and he shows Herod as the worst kind of human being
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   that there possibly can.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   I mean here's a man who abuses his power.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Here's a man who has got darkness in his heart.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Here's a man who struggles with jealousy, rage and anger.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   A man who any threats to his throne must be squashed.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   A man who decides out of a place of anger and insecurity
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   to basically order a genocide.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   To basically murder hundreds of Jewish children
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   in Bethlehem and in the villages surrounding it.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   The backdrop to the Christmas story
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   is the wailing and the suffering of families
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   whose children have been stolen from them and killed.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Herod represents for us in this story
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   the worst of what happens to humanity
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   when darkness overtakes our hearts.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   This is Adam and Eve
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Genesis 3
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   taken to its worst form.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   This is Matthew saying
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   this is what some of us can become like.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   And then he contrasts that
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   before we would get ourselves into much of a place of despondency
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   with Joseph.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And Matthew is basically saying
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   yes there are Herods in this world
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   but there are also Josephs.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And he shows us
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   what a relationship can be like with God
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   where despite the darkness in our hearts as humans
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   there is great faithfulness to be found.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Joseph is shown by Matthew here
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   as a kind, humble, faithful man.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   A man who's not perfect
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   but a man who hears the voice of God
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   and the word of God and decides to respond.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And in being obedient to God's word
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   unlike Adam in the garden who was disobedient
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   in being obedient to God's word
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   takes his Mary and Jesus
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   flees to Egypt and they survive
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   and the light is not as distinguished.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And so there's this idea of the darkness of Herod in humanity
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and yet the wonder that can be in humanity
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   with the faithfulness of Joseph.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   And Matthew's asking us all a strong question.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Which one do you want to be?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Because while there's probably no mass murderers sitting in this room
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   at least I hope not
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   there is a little bit of Herod in all of us, isn't there?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   There's a little bit of jealousy
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   of anger
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   a little bit of brokenness
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   a little bit of insecurity
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   a little bit of a desire for power sometimes.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   There are Herods if you will
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   that can sit in all of us.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And yet Matthew would say this
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   the light of Christ in Christmas time
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   illuminates ourselves
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   so that yes we become aware of the Herods
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   but in being aware of the Herods
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   we can bring them to the only place
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   where God can deal with them.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   A savior. One who's come.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   God with us.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   One who has revealed the beauty and the glory of God
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and so Joseph reminds us
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   that as we shine the light on ourselves
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   we bring our Herods.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   We don't bury them.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And as you go from 2021 to 2022
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   may Christmas encourage you
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   that the light of Christ shines a light on yourself
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   so that you can leave your Herods behind
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and walk like Joseph into the new year.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Not perfect
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   struggling at times
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   but humble before God
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   faithful and obedient to His word.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Let me tell you this
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   we're stepping into a new year
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   where there's still a lot of darkness in our city.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Where there's still a lot of challenge around us.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   And are we going to allow the Herods to win in us?
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Or are we going to bring our Herods
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   receive God's love
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   and then shine the light of Christ to the world
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   not the dirtiness of the Herods
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   that are buried in us.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Are you with me church?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Because light shines a light on ourselves.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   But it also shines a light on the world.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   One of the great things that we see in this passage
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   as Matthew unpacks this story
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   is the reality of what the world is truly like.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   And I love this.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I love the fact that in the Christmas story
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   God is not trying to bury the reality
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that there is still much brokenness in this world.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   I love the way that Matthew
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   connects it to the Old Testament passage in verse 18.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   He says, "A voice is heard in Ramah
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   weeping and great mourning."
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Rachel weeping for her children
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   and refusing to be comforted
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   because they are no more.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   He doesn't hide from the darkness of the genocide.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And he says, "Here's the reality.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   You want to know what's happening in Bethlehem right now
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   right after the birth of Jesus?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   It's not celebration. It's not joy.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   There's weeping taking place.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   There's hardship.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Things are still difficult in this world.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And the glory of the light of Christ
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   is that through Jesus
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   things are illuminated
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   so we can see them as they truly are.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Not so we can see them and be repulsed by them
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   but see them and be drawn to them
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   with the hope that is in us in Jesus Christ.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   That we can look out into the world around us
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and realize that so often
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   life is a contrast of rejoicing and weeping.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Of worship and the suffering that we see around us.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And as Christians we have been given the light of Christ
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   so that we might be vehicles of hope
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   to those that are suffering.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And the Christmas story reminds us
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   that the light that is in us is not just for us.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   That the light in that stable
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   was for the whole world.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And it's a light that shines outwards
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   from the church,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   God's people on earth.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And each one of you represents an incredible sphere of influence.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Where you've got darkness around you.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Friends, people, situations,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   hardship, stuff that's happening
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   that you know about in your sphere of influence.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And I tell you what, if you're anything like me
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   a lot of the conversations you're having with people these days
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   they're dark, sad, down kind of conversations.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I've had so many conversations recently with people at dinner
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   or over coffee and people bemoaning Hong Kong
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and all the bad stuff that's happening
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   and of course we are not to ignore the realities of our situation.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   But the light of Christ has come
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   so that these things could be illuminated
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   so that we wouldn't join in with the chorus of
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   "Oh yeah, isn't everything terrible?"
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   But we would join with a new chorus,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   a new song on our hearts
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   that we would shine with the hope of Jesus
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   not ignoring the realities of the world
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   but saying darkness does not win.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   That there is something that has come into this world
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   that now shines a light that is much needed.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So at Christmas time we have to be really careful
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   that we don't allow the rejoicing of our worship
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   as important as that is
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   to drown out the sobs of the people
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   who are lonely, who are sick, who are suffering.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Christmas, if it's anything,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   is a time that reminds us to pick up the call of Jesus
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   to follow Him into the real world.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   That world out there that desperately needs the light of Christ
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   and it's not a pastor in a building
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   that's going to bring that message.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   It's you sitting in these chairs.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   It's you watching online.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   It's the ones that carry the light of Christ in your lives.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Shine brightly, my friends.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   So a light that shines on ourselves,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   a light that shines on the world,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   but also, importantly, a light that shines on God.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   One of the things that Luke and Matthew
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   both celebrate in the Christmas story
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   is that when Jesus comes as the light of the world,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   He's given a name.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   He is Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   And so, Ellison spoke to the kids about this beautiful truth
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   that God is now present with us.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   What that means is when you see Jesus, you see God.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   100% God, 100% human in one form.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   That when we look upon the light of Christ,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   we get to see God in all of His illuminated glory,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   His character, His wonder, His mercy, His power,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and yes, most importantly,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   His triumph and victory over darkness.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Think about the story that Matthew's just presented for us.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   It is not a fair fight in that story
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   because you've got Herod with his mighty armies,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   Herod with his spies and informants,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Herod with all the power of the Roman Empire at his disposal,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   trying to hunt down a poor, defenseless mother, father, and child
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   who can't even find a proper house to be in,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   but are relegated to a stable with animals.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   This is not a fair fight.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Can you see the difference?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   The power of Rome and the brokenness of an impoverished Jewish family.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   And in that, we might think that darkness always wins,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   but we then see the inbreaking of the power of God.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   An angel to Joseph in a dream,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   "Take this child, flee to Egypt. You will be safe there."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Joseph, waking up, obedient to the call of God on his life,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   picking up his child, taking his wife,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   going to Egypt and slipping away.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   When we thought the empire had won, God brings his light again.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   And if Christmas is a story of anything,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   it's the story of a God who, when he acts, nothing can stop him.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   No darkness is dark like New Zealand
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   that can overpower the light of Christ in this world.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   The great message we have at Christmas,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   the great hope that you have,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   no matter how hard things might be for your life right now,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   and we're all struggling with something in our lives.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   There's all disconcert,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   and there's a sense of worry about our future.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   We're all carrying something,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   but the darkness doesn't get the final say.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It illuminates the power and the triumph of God.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Jesus would grow, take our sins, go to the cross, be resurrected.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   The church would be birthed by the power of the Spirit of God
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   spreading the word from Judea, Samaria, into the ends of the world.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   And now the church in our city gathered together,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   strong across the breadth of this city, rising up in 2021.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And it might feel like things are as dark today
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   as they were back then in the first century,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   but the light has not been extinguished.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And may I encourage you,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   as you come out of 2021 into 2022,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   can I encourage you, don't extinguish your light
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   because our city here in Hong Kong needs to see it more than ever before.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I wonder whether we as a church,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and by that I mean the church of our city, the church of Hong Kong,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I wonder whether we would make an effort in 2022
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   to actually realize that Christ has come to illuminate myself,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   to illuminate the world, to illuminate God,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   and we have a message of hope to bring,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   that if we can go out there into those spirits of influence that we have,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   not with the doom and the gloom and this is all really bad,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   but actually with a new song in our hearts,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   with a new word of hope,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   with the only hope that there is,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Jesus Christ, His light is in you,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   so that you would shine, not for your glory, but for His.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And I wonder what it would mean
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   for you to realize that Jesus is the divine,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   electromagnetic wavelength of this world.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   And He is bouncing off of everything out there.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   And when you have eyes to see,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   you will be blown away with the hope that there still is in Hong Kong,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   with the wonder that there still is in this world,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   that no matter what the Herods might try to say and do,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Christ has come.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Christ is here.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Emmanuel with us.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Let there be light.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   In Jesus name, everyone says, Amen.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Would you stand with me? I want to pray for you.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Father, we are so grateful that we have this light.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   So grateful that this light has come into darkness,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   so that we would know darkness doesn't get the final say,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   so that we would be filled with a joy ourselves,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   not just for our own personal salvation,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   as important as that is.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   But also filled with a light
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   so that we can be your hands and feet in a dark world.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And Lord, we know that your light shines
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   so that we can see the Herods in us.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And so Lord, I want to pray for anyone in this room here at Christmas time
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   who knows that there's a couple of Herods that are hanging on,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   a couple of things that they're struggling with.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Lord, I know that you don't want to have anyone in this room
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   stepping or online, stepping out of 2021 and 22,
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   carrying some of those things with them.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So Lord, I want to pray for the beauty of the light of conviction
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   that shines in our hearts and enables us to deal with our sin.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And we do that simply by confessing and bringing it to you
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and joyfully handing it to you,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   knowing that we are forgiven and set free.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Lord, I pray that you would change the Herods
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   and move us like Joseph into a place of greater faithfulness
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and obedience in the year ahead.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Lord, we don't do it in our strength.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   We do it by the power of your spirit at work in us,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   the light of Christ shining on ourselves.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Lord, I pray you would awaken our eyes to see Hong Kong in 2022
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   like never before.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Lord, we don't ignore the realities of a changing political context.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   We don't ignore the realities of a pandemic
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   that still is at work in this world.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   But Father, we want to step forward in 2022
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   with eyes that see the hope in the darkness,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   eyes that see Christ's light at work,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   eyes that are able to rejoice in the beauty
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   that Christ is not reserved to 90 minutes on a Sunday in a building,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   but is vibrant and alive,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   bouncing off of all of the world out there.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Open our eyes to see it, Lord.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And Father, we pray that in 2022 we would see you like never before,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   that you would shine a light on God,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   that we would see your compassion, your love, your mercy, your glory,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   that it would open our eyes,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   and that would be the fuel that would drive us to share the gospel.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Lord, we want 2022 to be a year of harvest for our city,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   2022 to be a year of harvest in our sphere of influence,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   our friends and our families that don't know you.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Lord, would the light of Christ come, Lord?
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Lord, I want to pray a prayer of empowerment for people in this room
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   who have friends and family that don't know Jesus.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Lord, I pray that their own lives
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   would be a light of the gospel shining to them,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   that, Lord, at the right time and in the right way,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   you would fill them with your spirit
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   to share the light of the gospel directly with their friends and family.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Father, we want to tell of your story in this world, Lord.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   So fill us with your light.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   So may your light, Lord, drive us onwards.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   And we celebrate this here on Boxing Day in 2021.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Thank you for coming, the light of the world.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   We follow you into the darkness with your light.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Everyone says, "Amen, amen."
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Why don't we worship together as a congregation?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.400]   communication.
