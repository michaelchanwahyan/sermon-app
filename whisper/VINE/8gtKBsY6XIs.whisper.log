[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   So a few days ago I was in a Chinese restaurant and I had the most exuberant waiter you could
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.840]   ever imagine.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.680]   Every time I ordered anything his reply was, "Why not?"
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.160]   Which I thought was quite funny.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200]   "Can I have a Coke?"
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200]   "Why not?"
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.440]   "I'd like some more fried rice, please."
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.440]   "Why not?"
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.440]   "Where's the bathroom?"
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.120]   "Why not?"
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.560]   But he was so full of life and literally his answer to everything was, "Why not?"
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.080]   With a big smile on his face.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080]   As we were just worshipping and singing those words, "I magnify you, Lord."
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.360]   And as I think about the start of this new year of the rabbit, the first day of the Chinese
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.600]   New Year, I hear God leaning over you and saying, "Why not?"
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.720]   Why not this year?
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.260]   Why not in this moment?
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.420]   Why not those dreams that you've held on your hearts for so long?
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.040]   Why not that thing that you were wanting to start, maybe a business or an idea?
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.120]   I feel like we're stepping into a season of harvest.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.160]   I feel like we're stepping into a season of opportunity.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.400]   And I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying over the vine, "Why not?"
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.160]   We're planting a church this year in Yuen Long at a time when the economy is not great,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.440]   it's an expensive thing to do.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.680]   And God says, "Why not?"
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.960]   Whatever it is that's going on in your heart and your life right now where there are challenges
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.040]   for you or there's even just a sense of fear of holding back, a sense of like, "I don't
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040]   know, it's a risk.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.200]   I feel like I'm going to take a risk."
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.360]   And I feel like the Lord is just wanting to release you from fear, release you from anxiety,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.040]   and say that this year is a year of opportunity for you.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.480]   It doesn't mean, it's very important, it doesn't mean that everything's going to work out perfectly.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.560]   The Christian life is not a life where God is a Santa Claus who waves a magic wand and
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.920]   suddenly our lives are perfect.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.200]   If you've been a Christian for a long time, you'll know that that's not the way it works.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.160]   But we have a God who meets us in the highs and the lows.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.000]   We have a God who says, "Forget the former things, for a new thing is at work.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.680]   And I will announce it to you before you see it spring up."
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.400]   That's that passage I read to us just before we started worshiping.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.200]   I will announce it to you before it springs up.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.800]   The why not attitude is one where God comes and announces things to us before he has actually
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.360]   done them.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.640]   This is your year.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640]   This is going to happen.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.520]   This is going to take place.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.880]   Have some courage.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   Take some risk.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.520]   Step out in faith.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.200]   I've got you.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   Why not?
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.600]   If you'd like to receive just a little bit of that today, I wonder if you just open your
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   hands.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   I want to pray for us.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.960]   Father, I thank you so much for the men and women in this room, for the children here,
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.360]   for young and old alike.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.080]   We thank you for the start of this new year, a year of this beautiful idea of this longevity
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.960]   and peace and tranquility and hope.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.120]   Lord, I believe that this is a year of opportunity for people in this room and those watching
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   online right now.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.480]   I believe this is a why not kind of year.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.400]   And Lord, I pray the same exuberance I had from that waiter would be the same exuberance
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.360]   that they sense the Spirit of God working in their lives this year.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.760]   Saying hey, step out in faith.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.840]   Take that step of courage.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   Why not?
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   Why not?
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Why not?
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   I'm your God.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.640]   I'm with you and I am for you.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.400]   Nothing can be against you.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.720]   And so Lord, I pray for those in this room where they're in a bit of a tough spot, where
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.640]   things are a bit hard right now.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.760]   Lord, I want to pray that your Spirit of hope would come.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.920]   I pray that today they would be able to lift their eyes a little bit higher to where their
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.920]   hope comes from.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.320]   And Lord, for those of us in this room that are longing for new things, maybe those of
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.520]   us in this room who are sensing a passion for something but not sure what the first
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.120]   step is, sensing a calling out of God but not sure how to activate that in their lives.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.920]   So Lord, I pray that they would feel the wind of your Spirit moving them forward today,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   Lord.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.840]   And Father, we thank you that at the beginning of a new year, we can forget the former things,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.880]   that we can step into this hope that you have provided for us.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.560]   And Lord, I want to pray for everyone here that 2023 would be a year where you speak
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.520]   things over them before they spring up.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.360]   That they would have the courage to do things because you have spoken over them, even before
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.640]   they've seen the impact of that in the physical.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.000]   That they would know that God is saying something to them in a spiritual that would actually
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.240]   enliven their hearts to take whatever step it is that needs to be taken in the physical.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.520]   Lord, we thank you that you're like that.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.880]   And Lord, we just commit our hearts to this.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.240]   For you love this city of Hong Kong and you, Lord, are for this city, Lord.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.480]   Fill us with hope, with joy, and may this year be a year of the why not.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.400]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   Everyone says amen.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.440]   Can we thank the worship team because they're amazing and we love them and they're awesome
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   and they're dressed in red.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.320]   As you sit down, why don't you say hi to someone?
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.000]   Say, "Hey, wow, nice to meet you.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Who are you?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.400]   I don't know you.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.320]   You seem like a nice person.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   Be friendly.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   So good."
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.600]   Well, Sunday at Firelock, again, it's so great to be with you guys here on Chinese New Year,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.560]   the actual first day of Chinese New Year.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.360]   If you've been fasting, we break our fast today, which is a wonderful thing.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.360]   And we are so glad you're here.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.280]   And I'm excited because we're doing a one-off message today as we celebrate the reality
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.440]   of Chinese New Year.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   And the chairman of our elders, Sydney Yip, is coming.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.720]   Can we put our hands together for Sydney?
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.760]   I just want you to know how good-looking Sydney and I are today, wearing matching outfits
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.880]   that we did not coordinate, did we?
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.880]   I don't know.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.880]   We...
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   Coordinated in spirit.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.880]   Coordinated in spirit.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   That is absolutely right.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.880]   Beautiful thing.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   Would you stretch out your hands?
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   We're going to pray for Sydney.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   Father, thank you for this man.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.600]   Lord, I have the rare privilege of seeing this man lead publicly like he will do today,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.880]   but more often lead privately, behind the scenes as the chairman of our eldership, serving
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:40.360]   this church faithfully, putting in hours that many people don't know about, sacrificing,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.640]   doing the hard meetings as well as the good ones.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.480]   Lord, I really honor this man of faith.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.160]   And Father, I pray that as he opens up this passage, which really speaks a lot about his
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.320]   own experience, Lord, that you would open our hearts.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.120]   Lord, we don't want the seed of your Word to fall on hardened ground.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.320]   So here at the start of this new year, would you just come and open our hearts to you.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.720]   And we thank you for this, in Jesus' name.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   Amen.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.840]   Thank you, Andrew.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.360]   When Jesus was about to ascend to heaven, he spoke about the coming kingdom.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:26.080]   So what he said was, "It is not for you to know the time or seasons that the Father has
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.880]   fixed by his own authority."
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.320]   So happy Chinese New Year once again.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.440]   I believe many of you are unprepared as much as I was in the transition of Christmas to
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.040]   New Year, and now it's Chinese New Year.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.840]   So it's a lot got to do with timing, and especially for the Chinese New Year.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.400]   Even for the flowers that we bought for the Chinese New Year, you need the timing, and
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.200]   you need the timing right.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.240]   So like a daffodil that we have nicely here, well, you have to buy it at the right time.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.520]   You have to trim it.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   You have to warm it.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.200]   You have to shine it.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.640]   And then along the way, you notice that, well, fragrance is coming.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.320]   The bud of the flower is there.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:16.240]   And then, well, for all you know, along the way, there are more blossoms and more fragrance.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.800]   And well, the best is if it opens up in full blossom on a New Year's Day.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.200]   So that's about season.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:33.380]   As much as flowers is for seasons, we all go through different seasons in life.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:39.120]   So I would like to take this opportunity to share something about times and seasons on
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.720]   this very special day.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:49.240]   Well, I guess I am privileged, and I'm seasoned enough in terms of age, to reflect on this
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.640]   subject.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.640]   I want to start by sharing a very short story by none other than Toh Kien.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:04.720]   Well, he was in a kind of impasse, basically was stuck while writing up his masterpiece,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.480]   The Lord of the Rings.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.400]   So he was very worried and concerned that he won't be able to finish the piece.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.200]   So the title is Leaf by Nego.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   So Nego is an artist.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.800]   He's a painter.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:27.020]   He had this vision of drawing a really, really beautiful tree at the countryside.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.480]   So he started with drawing a leaf.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:38.960]   He spent a lot of time making sure that that very leaf was really great, beautiful, magnificent.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.200]   But he was also very stuck.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.400]   He had a lot of mundane that he needed to deal with.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.960]   And to add on to all this, his neighbor by the name of Parrish always sought for his
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.040]   help at unwarranted time.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.960]   And this Parrish wife even fell sick needing the care of Nego.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.000]   And also on Nego's heart, he has some concerns because he has a journey that he needs to
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.400]   make, which he was really reluctant to go forth.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:20.480]   Well, he fell sick after taking care of Parrish's wife, and he departed.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:28.520]   So all that he was left was that canvas of one small leaf.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:35.000]   Well, it was beautiful, but after the storm that ruined his house, that leaf was finally
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.480]   retrieved to be put up in a museum, where sadly, very few people really visited.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:49.000]   Now as Nego journeyed on, he arrived at the countryside.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.560]   And lo and behold, he saw the very tree that he had envisaged to paint and draw.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.320]   So there stood the magnificent tree in the countryside.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.520]   And he even met his neighbor, Parrish.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.760]   And there he find much comfort.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.840]   So after writing this short story, Tolkien find his own comfort.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:21.480]   He was able to gather further strength to finish his masterpiece, Lord of the Rings.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.080]   I find much comfort in reading this story.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:33.720]   The thing is, well, what we are doing on earth, which could be a very, very small representation
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:44.240]   of the magnificence, the tree, the countryside that God had ordained for us, we may be representing
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.560]   or doing a small token to appreciate or to reflect on the glory of the things that God
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:12:03.360]   had in mind and will future be fulfilled in due time.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.160]   What we did on earth had a bearing even in the heavenly.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:17.040]   Now do you remember when Jesus resurrected from death, he showed his lone scar to Thomas.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.400]   So what was inflected on earth had a heavenly bearing.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.800]   So as a surgeon, I was always reminded, whatever wound that I inflect on my patients, that
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   would leave a scar and the scar would last a real long time.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:40.000]   So whatever we did, there is a heavenly bearing.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.400]   Our earthly work could amount to the heavenly good.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:51.280]   What was done on earth indeed carries a marking all the way to the heavens.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.680]   Our earthly work could amount to heavenly good.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.240]   By the way, while it could be incidental, it could be divine.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:07.040]   My family name is none other than Yip.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.280]   So whenever I was greeted in the corridor, in the ward, in the OR, while I was actually
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:19.080]   reminded that, well, what I was doing is to paint my leaf and the leaf should bring glory
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:25.040]   to God, I spent much time going through my half-time transition.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:31.840]   That process included relocation back to Singapore from, I mean, from Singapore to Hong Kong
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.520]   to work in an academic medical center.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.480]   I felt it was God's hands guiding.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.700]   And about the time of the finish of my contract, I made some renewed commitments to God and
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:52.760]   to myself that I would strive even better in my career, in my vocation.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.500]   But then I was not offered a new contract.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.480]   That was my winter season.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:08.520]   My personal ambition to be the best in my field, to build up the strongest team, somehow
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.520]   vanished.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:17.680]   Now, today, I want to share with you how this turning around season will show that God has
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:24.600]   purposefully put changing seasons in a year to remind us of the changing seasons in life.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:30.560]   Now, this few weeks, we have been dwelling on Isaiah, which really talks about how God
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:36.800]   bring new things in the world in critical moments of history.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.920]   Now I shall refer to yet another prophet, Jeremiah.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.340]   Jeremiah wrote at around time of Jerusalem's fall.
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:52.480]   And then from there, we'll reflect on the turning points in history as well as in life.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   Now as mentioned, Jeremiah was writing at around the time of the fall of Jerusalem to
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.960]   Babylon.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.920]   Yet, he was pointing forward to the new covenant.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:11.360]   After 70 years of exile, that a new covenant of God will be fulfilled, and he was writing
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   to the exiles.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:18.520]   Now, according to some scholars, Jerusalem was actually besieged in the winter times.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.320]   And winter, even in the Middle East, in Israel, could be tough, it could be cold, it's rainy,
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:29.240]   and it could be most challenging for the besieged city.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:36.120]   And somehow, yet, the most familiar verse we have in Jeremiah is probably chapter 29,
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.320]   verse 11.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:45.120]   "For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, and plans
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.440]   to give you a hope and a future."
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:54.640]   Wow, do we knowing or unknowingly take the verses outside of its context?
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.920]   We always embrace the new hope.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:04.040]   And yet, while Jeremiah was writing, it was in a season of dark winter.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:10.800]   How are these promises going to sink into their real world at that point in time?
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:17.360]   And furthermore, Jeremiah actually, against all conventional wisdom, he recognized a different
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:24.080]   reality and proceeded to purchase a piece of land when the city was besieged.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:31.280]   So it was recorded that he bought a piece of field at Annabas from his cousin and weighed
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.800]   out for him 70 shekels of silver.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:42.280]   He signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out on the silver of the scales.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.480]   But at that point, the piece of land is already under Babylon's control.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.960]   And it seems an act of folly to purchase a property that would be lost forever.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.280]   Yet, Jeremiah sees a different reality.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.240]   The word of the Lord, he bought the property, have it witnessed, and went through all the
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.160]   needed legal deals.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.360]   Jeremiah was purchasing a piece of land as an act of prophecy.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:17.920]   Now there is tremendous theology significance attached to land.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:27.640]   Land is a promise and a gift from God, Yahweh, to both Abraham and the entire Israel nation.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:38.240]   And now the Lord is declaring via Jeremiah that while everything seems hopeless, hope
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.480]   begins to be a strength of all.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.200]   Shall we call this hope against all odds?
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:54.640]   In fact, Jeremiah further on says on behalf of God that he will surely gather them from
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   all the lands.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.120]   He will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.640]   They will be my people and I will be their God.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.800]   How should we understand God's promises and timing of fulfillment via the lands of changing
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.800]   seasons?
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:21.440]   That indeed, all things are made beautiful in His time.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:28.120]   As we reflect on the winter season and the spring seasons, we appreciate even more the
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.120]   significance of the turning of seasons.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.760]   So let's start with winter.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.320]   Well winter here is pretty moderate.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.600]   But when you think of winter, you think of your skiing trip in Japan.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.440]   That does not count as holiday.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.280]   Well but in real natural life, winter is a season of decline.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:59.320]   The days grow shorter, the lights are dimmer, summer's abundance and winter's colors began
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.100]   to fade.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:07.760]   Everything decayed and now there's a monocony, a sense of impending loss sets in.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:16.440]   Well I must confess I'm a very sentimental person and I am very pessimistic overall.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:23.000]   I tend to be drawn deeply by the prospect of death rather than lifted by the hope of
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   new life.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.720]   In fact, death victory can sometimes seem supreme.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.780]   It was only last month, I mean last March, that we witnessed the horrendous hay walk
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:40.280]   that was inflected on the local population including the elderly.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.840]   How shall we come out of this downward spiral?
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:51.960]   Now in the Midwest, in US, where I spent some of my time doing my training, newcomers were
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.520]   given this piece of advice during the winter time.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:03.400]   The winters will drive you crazy until you learn to get out into them.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:11.200]   So there the people would buy decent clothing, warm, so that they can get outdoors and avoid
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.560]   the cabin fever that otherwise will arise if they continue to huddle fearfully by the
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.600]   fire during the hot frozen winters.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:26.920]   Essentially, we learned that a daily walk into the winter world would fortify the spirit
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:33.720]   within us by taking us boldly to the very heart of the season.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:41.400]   Well the coldest winter that I ever experienced was when I did my medical student internship
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.240]   in Toronto.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:49.880]   So where, while I was living in Chinatown as a poor medical student, I have to walk
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.320]   about 20, 30 minutes all the way to Toronto General Hospital and Sick Kids Children's
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.600]   Hospital for some of you who know the place.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:06.280]   So in a deep winter, the cleaners would prepare the road at around 5, 5.30, clean up the road,
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.920]   but they pile up all the snow to the pedestrian walk.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.360]   So I would be literally walking through four or five feet of snow all piled up so that
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.280]   I can reach the hospital.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:24.320]   But there's no point waiting for the bus because you will get frozen before the bus arrives.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.560]   But the good thing about this daily walk at 6 o'clock when light is just beginning to
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:36.800]   dawn is it is exactly that you walk into the winter, you train, you fortify your spirit.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.880]   And I was actually thankful because that daily walk helped me consolidate my desire to be
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:48.440]   trained as a surgeon, to be resilient.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.600]   Well but at the same time, God is gracious.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.120]   It can be really cold.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.760]   It could be minus 20 or minus 30 in Toronto.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:05.440]   So for the coldest winter day that year, I was actually on duty in the hospital.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:12.160]   So what happens is I'm warm, I'm safe, and I don't have to wake up early next morning
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.480]   to walk that walk through the winter.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.240]   While a lot of my seniors and other staff could not make it because the snowfall had
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.280]   blocked all the major highways.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:27.560]   So I really, really impressed my boss when I appear early in the morning before everybody
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.120]   else.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:36.400]   While winter, other than reminding us that there are times of dormancy and deep rest,
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:43.920]   and they're essential to all living things, we are also to acknowledge that ultimately
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.200]   in those winters, God is our refuge.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.760]   The past years have been a long winter for many of us in this congregation.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.640]   In fact, our inner winters can take many forms.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:09.800]   Failure, losses, depression, separation from family, or even death.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.440]   But every one of them yields the same advice.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:22.280]   The winters will drive us crazy until we learn to get out into them.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:28.960]   Until we enter boldly into the fears that we most want to avoid, those fears will dominate
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.640]   our lives.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.760]   But when we walk boldly and directly into them, of course protected by the warmth from
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:43.040]   the community of your faith community, and the guidance from the Holy Spirit, we can
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.720]   learn what winter got to teach us.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:54.680]   Then we discover once again the cycle of seasons is trustworthy and life-giving, even in the
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.560]   most dismaying season of all.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:05.960]   That I got the diagnosis of leukemia was winter to me.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:14.480]   What I chose to start treatment was my walking into the winters.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:21.320]   Well as I've shared, I'm easily fixated on surface appearances, on the decline of meaning,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:27.280]   the decay of relationships, the death of a work, an ambition.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:35.440]   And yet as I look more deeply, I can see that there are possibilities being planted to bear
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.600]   fruit in some seasons yet to come.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:51.920]   Even Jeremiah shared in lamentation, "Because of the lost great love, we are not consumed.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.760]   For my compassions never fail.
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   They are new every morning."
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.320]   Great is your faithfulness.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.360]   Yeah, indeed great is God's faithfulness.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   So in retrospect, I can see that in my own life, I could not see the things that I could
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.160]   not see at that particular time point.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:22.080]   How the job that I lost, that left me in dismay, actually helped me find work that I really
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.120]   needed to do.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:32.960]   How the road closure turned me towards terrain that would otherwise not travel.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:41.680]   How losses that I feel so irredeemable forced me to find new meanings.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:49.400]   On the surface, it may seem that life was lessening, but silently and lavishly, the
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:54.520]   seeds of new life were always being sown.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:02.080]   As I moved into private practice, I actually learned this verse all over again, "Forget
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.360]   the former things, embrace the new."
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:11.000]   I could be practicing in a different setting, but I can still offer my best for the very
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.520]   patients that God entrusted us.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:23.280]   And I'm confident and glad to say the department also moved into even higher grounds.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:32.640]   Now new opportunity arise also as I roll into seminary studies as a part-time old student.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.800]   I guess I was the oldest in the class.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.720]   Anyway, it was a dream come true.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:45.960]   A dream that I turned down some 35 years ago when I had my first calling to enter into
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.120]   seminary studies.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.520]   So it's a dream come true and I was given a second chance.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:27:01.960]   Now the mere joy of knowing, of knowing him better and the opportunity to share my limited
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:08.440]   understanding are by themselves a tremendous blessing for me.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:15.320]   Even Jeremiah shared, "They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:22.520]   They will rejoice in the bounty of the Lord, the grain, the olives, and the new wine.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:28.680]   They will be like a well-watered garden and they will sorrow no more."
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.840]   Even more importantly, it's not about renewed material blessings.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.680]   Jeremiah is talking about a new heart, a new heart for the new season.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.600]   This is the covenant I will make, says the Lord.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.480]   I will put new laws in their minds and write it in their hearts.
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.440]   I will be their God and they will be my people.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:28:00.000]   And you know, all these promises are laid at the harsh winter for the besieged Israelites.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.840]   Yet they are fulfilled in due time.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:10.640]   If not for the war, the winter is kind of a preparatory season for spring.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.280]   It's rainy and it prepares the land.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.400]   Even the Song of Songs talked about this.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.480]   "See, the winter is past.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.120]   The rains are over and gone.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.720]   Flowers appear on the earth.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:35.000]   The season of singing has come.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.680]   The calling of those is heard in our land."
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.720]   A new song.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:46.360]   Well, spring comes slowly and tentatively, but it grows with a tenacity.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.680]   I still remember that year while myself and the whole family was doing my training in
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.960]   St. Louis.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:29:00.560]   That winter creeps very much into April and we were, as a family, a little bit depressed
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.240]   with the long winter.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:09.040]   So as I tried to bring my kids to venture out a little bit, one odd day we suddenly
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:16.560]   realized that they are the smallest, the most tender shoots, began to find their way.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:25.840]   They have insisted to have their way coming out through grounds that once was deemed barren.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:33.160]   Those very small sprouts of life, of green leaves, are always a glimpse, a high binger
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.720]   of hope.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.640]   And from those very, very small beginnings, hope grows at a geometric rate.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:51.900]   The days get longer, the winds get warmer, and the world grows green again.
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:58.800]   As I shared early on while I studied in the seminary, in the midst of my own medical condition,
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.320]   the fallout of my business partnership, and of course, the COVID season, I was wondering
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.720]   what I studied, would it bear fruits at all?
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.320]   But very interestingly and paradoxically, because of the social distancing measures,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.600]   we birthed this online teaching ministry.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:24.160]   So together with quite a few other committed fellow brothers and sisters, we actually began
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.540]   a study course called Tree of Life Discipleship Program.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:36.600]   So we ran modules covering areas of calling, of faith at work, of relationship, of leadership,
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   and of restoration.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.080]   We were blessed to have the privilege to share the word with people from within and from
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.200]   outside of Bain, and also beyond Hong Kong.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:55.760]   Now still in our small lives, in our own lives, even as our winters transit into spring, we
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:04.600]   sometimes find it hard to credit the small gleams of hope of larger life to come.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   We sometimes find it hard to find hope until we find that the outcome is secure.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:18.920]   So therefore spring, spring teaches us to look carefully, really carefully for the green
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:28.120]   stems of possibilities, for the intuition that may turn into a larger insight, for the
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:35.840]   touch that will unfreeze a frozen relationship, especially for families who are broken apart
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:45.000]   physically, geographically, or emotionally, for the strangest act of kindness that will
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.900]   make the world seem more hospitable again all over.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:58.080]   We used to have the blessing of living in a house in the rural area for a season, and
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   Vivian loved to tend to the garden.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:09.040]   The garden was filled with undergrowth, with trees, fruits, in the tiny meadow with flowers
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.720]   and grasses.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:16.640]   And sometimes looking beyond the spring, we can almost envisage the next season to be
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.340]   a steady state of plenty, of green, of muchness.
[00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:28.880]   Of course we understand that nature does not necessarily always produce abundance.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:35.080]   Even in Israel, there were times that flood or drought destroyed crops and threatened
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.400]   the lives and the livelihood of those who worked the fields.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:48.800]   But nature normally takes us through a reliable cycle of scarcity and then abundance, in which
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:58.720]   times of deprivation actually foreshadows an eventual return to the bountiful fields.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:05.000]   That is very biblical to see that kind of seasons in life.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.040]   Be glad, people of Zion.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:17.240]   Rejoice in the Lord your God, for he has given you the autumn rains because he is faithful.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:24.440]   He sends you abundant showers, both autumn and spring rains, as before.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.440]   The threshing floors will be filled with grain.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:37.400]   The vats will overflow new wine, new oil, new wine, new oil.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.120]   So Joel was actually famous for his locust prophecy.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.400]   But then when we realize the new season that we are in, then we can be assured, we can
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:53.320]   be assured that at his time, we will make up for the years of the locust.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:34:02.280]   We will make up for the years of the loss, and we shall eat our field of good food.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:11.880]   We shall be full of praise to God, as we know without question that he is in the sake of
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.600]   life with us.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.120]   He is in the sake of life with us.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:30.240]   Well, to some extent, we invest in a church plan in such a difficult social economic situation.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:37.280]   And this season is actually a resemblance of Jeremiah's purchasing a piece of land when
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.400]   Jerusalem was besieged.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:47.160]   Yet, as a church body, we are also embracing that in seasons of life, at his time, he will
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:52.320]   breathe new life into us and into the city.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.560]   And in days to come, we shall bear fruits.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:05.120]   You may be in a season of decline or dormancy, as in winter, or you are picking up new hope,
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.120]   as in spring.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:12.200]   But remember that our times is in his hands.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.840]   Later on, we'll have some prayer time together that will speak life into the new seasons.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:25.960]   Suffix to know that the Asian Greeks has two different words for the very concept of time,
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.080]   chronos and kairos.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:37.600]   The word chronos, or some other words that we are familiar with, chronology, chronicles,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:44.240]   the word chronos refers to measured ticking time, quantitative time.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:50.400]   Chronos is the forward propelling time that we measure with clocks, with watches.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.040]   But time does not end there.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:00.480]   The Greek word for time can also be kairos.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:08.960]   Chronos time is where there is a divine timing, or the suitable moments where God intervenes,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.980]   as if he's pressing a reboot button for us.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.800]   So here we are, we learn quite a bit of Greek these days.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.240]   In the past week, we learned kairos.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:28.440]   God is doing a kairos, new thing, a new thing right now that has never happened before.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.680]   Now we learn kairos.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.160]   God does a kairos thing in a kairos time.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:41.000]   He does a new thing in a new divine appointed time.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.640]   Well, of course, we now know that he's turning into spring, as in the chronos of time.
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:56.960]   But whatever season of life you may feel you are in, God can interject and change your
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.160]   course.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.680]   That is his kairos moment.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:07.440]   But even more importantly, let's seize that kairos moment, the divine time that God has
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:14.200]   ordained to live out what God has appointed us to do.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:23.440]   Tolkien says, "We all have to decide what to do with the time that is given us."
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:31.360]   We all have to decide what to do with the time given us.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:38.440]   I had the privilege of submitting some of my homework assignments to Dr. and Reverend
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:45.960]   Philip Young, who is by himself a medical doctor, but he also later changed tracks to
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:51.800]   become lecturer in the China Graduate School of Theology.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:57.600]   He had always been a beloved teacher, well-known in the local scene for the Word of God in
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.040]   Old Testament as well as marketplace theology.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:10.560]   He was writing these comments to me well before he himself was diagnosed in aggressive cancer.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:17.240]   So I have the privilege to share some of his thoughts.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:25.880]   It is not easy to face the cruel reality of death and the uncertainties of life.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:32.000]   How true it is that life is not in our own hands, but more importantly, it's not in the
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.400]   hands of fate either, but it is in our God, our creator.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:45.560]   And in him, we do have the hope, not only of the eternal life after death, but also
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:51.520]   in the sovereign God who will work out his purposes in the given time of our life on
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.900]   earth.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:39:02.720]   For this reason, we, myself included, I will have nothing to lose or to fear.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:10.160]   Everything I ever had is from him, and he will fulfill his goodwill in and through my
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.640]   life, our lives.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:20.960]   Listen and attend to whatever burden God puts in your heart, in our hearts, and live it
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.520]   out to the best of our abilities.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:31.560]   It is the quality, not the quantity, that matters in the end.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:38.760]   And anything done for the Lord's sake has eternal meaning and significance.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.360]   Remember Jesus' scar.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.760]   Remember the leaf by a nickel.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:51.480]   It represents a glorious tree in a magnificent countryside.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:59.120]   I believe that the most important thing in life is relationship with God, with people
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.680]   around us, and with ourselves.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:11.320]   And we are to cherish these gifts and make them a special offering to our creator God
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.200]   with gratitude and love.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.720]   This is what life is all about.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:25.420]   While I still struggle often as much as Nicol did, wondering whether the trivial things
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.160]   that I did ever matter.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:35.720]   But we are also encouraged to know that while we may only be drawing a very small leaf of
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:43.520]   that gigantic tree, it is a miniature representation of his enormous good.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:54.920]   And in seasons and at the right time, he will bring our seed of faithful work to full fruition.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.680]   Can I invite all of us to stand?
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:06.000]   It's important that at the turn of season that we commit ourselves new hope, which really
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   comes from the Lord.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:15.160]   I also heard from some sharing from other fellow members that that new hope should also
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.320]   include a renewed commitment and relationship in the family.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:26.720]   So I'm hoping that indeed we take this opportunity that you gather in small groups of two or
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:34.560]   three, that you pray and speak into that new hope that God has installed for you.
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:42.200]   So pray for the new hope and pray for renewed family commitments if you do have a family.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.600]   So shall we spend the next two or three minutes praying for each other before we have corporate
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.880]   prayers and closures?
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:42:00.200]   For those young kids that are brought together to St. Louis, who saw how winter transited
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.080]   into spring as they saw all the new sprouts of leaves.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.720]   Now they are grown up and we're entering into a new relationship.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:17.440]   So new hope for the new season for me is also renewed relationship with them as adults.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.720]   So I want to say a prayer on behalf of this congregation together with all of us into
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   our families.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:31.640]   Dear Lord, we just want to thank you as we turn into new season, help us seize the Kairos
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   moment.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:40.120]   Lord, we thank you that you put us into different families surrounded by loved ones.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:48.320]   And regardless of the former, of the past, of how sometimes, somehow our relationships
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:56.840]   are frozen, are broken, Lord, we ask for your renewal in a new season, in a new season that
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:05.280]   we find renewal and restoration of those loving relationship in family, in community, and
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.400]   even in the society.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:11.900]   We thank you because in you we find that new hope.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:17.280]   And we know there is this divine moment that you intervene in our lives.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.080]   In Jesus name, amen, amen.
