1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Good morning to everyone online.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 And I wanna give a quick shout out to June and Paul.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,960
 If you watch this, just know that God can meet you

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,720
 wherever you are and that he's right there with you.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,600
 Before I start this morning, I wanna share something

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,640
 that happened on the train this morning

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,560
 as I was heading into church.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,240
 So I was on the train and I was playing my word games.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,360
 Who likes word games?

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,360
 I love word games, crosswords and word blitz,

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,000
 how many words you can find in a minute,

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
 all that kind of thing.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,600
 All the secret word game people like, not me.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
 So I was doing that on the train coming in

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,400
 and I just felt challenged by God to stop and be still.

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,760
 So I shut off my phone and closed my eyes.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,240
 And I said to God, can you really meet me in all of this?

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,240
 If you're a public transport person like I am,

19
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,840
 you know, there was a lady across from me

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,320
 who was listening to tunes without her earphones,

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,360
 having a great time, you know.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,560
 So in my heart, I said,

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,000
 God, can you really meet me in this?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And he immediately said to me, I can, I can, but can you?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,640
 And then I heard him say,

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,160
 Susanna, I'm bringing all of myself to this.

27
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,760
 I'm not holding anything back.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,960
 I'm bringing all of my power, all of my presence.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,360
 Can you match me today?

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,720
 Can you bring all of yourself?

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,960
 Not leaving any part of you behind.

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,760
 And I'm sharing that with you

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,280
 because I don't believe it's a challenge just for me.

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,800
 I believe it's a challenge for all of us today

35
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,920
 to take a moment to choose,

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,680
 to bring all of ourselves into this moment, to be present.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,680
 To not leave parts of our life hidden

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,200
 or away from God's presence

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,920
 as if he doesn't already know they exist,

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,120
 but to bring it all,

41
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,160
 to match him as he has come bringing all of himself to us.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,800
 The promise of better days

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,680
 those who cannot remember the past

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,000
 are condemned to repeat it.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,760
 This was spoken by a philosopher, George Santayana.

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,000
 And in the book of Matthew,

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,560
 we see Matthew taking the opportunity

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,880
 to remind the Jewish people of their past,

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,040
 calling on them to not forget,

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,720
 calling on them to make the connection to Jesus

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,040
 and why he came,

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,840
 to bring them out of Egypt, that symbol of enslavement,

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
 to bring them into freedom and healing and hope.

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,040
 So we pick up the story in Matthew 2.

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,480
 The Magi have been to visit Jesus.

56
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,920
 They've brought their gifts of gold and myrrh

57
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,480
 and frankincense.

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,840
 And Herod knows that a child

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,000
 prophesied to be the King of the Jews

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,760
 has been born.

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,000
 And he says to the Magi, "Come and tell me,

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 when you find this child, come back to me

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,040
 and tell me where this child is."

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,800
 The Magi get warned in a dream not to do that.

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,160
 So in Matthew 2, verses 13 to 14, it says,

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,520
 "When they, the Magi, had gone,

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,800
 an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream.

68
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,320
 'Get up,' he said, 'take the child and his mother

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,200
 and escape to Egypt.

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,880
 Stay there until I tell you,

71
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,560
 for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.'

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
 and left for Egypt,

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,080
 where he stayed until the death of Herod.

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,640
 And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said

76
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,640
 through the prophet, 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'"

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 In this passage, Matthew mentions Jesus' escape to Egypt

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,240
 and His return from Egypt

79
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,080
 in order to remind the Jewish people of the Old Testament,

80
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,080
 prophetic hope of the Messiah coming out of Egypt.

81
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,800
 This line, "Out of Egypt I called my son,"

82
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,440
 is a direct quote from the prophet Hosea.

83
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,920
 In Hosea chapter 11, verses one to four,

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,120
 he prophesies, "When Israel was a child, I loved him

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,560
 and out of Egypt I called my son.

86
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,800
 But the more they were called,

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,640
 the more they went away from me.

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,360
 They sacrificed to the Baals

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,800
 and they burned incense to images.

90
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,560
 It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,640
 taking them by the arms,

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,160
 but they did not realise it was I who healed them.

93
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,760
 I led them with cords of human kindness, with ties of love.

94
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,480
 To them I was like one who lifts a child to the cheek,

95
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,280
 and I bent down to feed them."

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
 The Old Testament foreshadows

97
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,680
 what's to come in the New Testament.

98
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,560
 Here in this passage, Hosea is reminding the people

99
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,960
 that God brought Israel out of Egypt,

100
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,000
 freeing them from all that enslaved them

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,360
 and reigniting their hope for the future.

102
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,320
 Interestingly, this is one of the rare moments in the Bible

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,400
 where God is presented to us from a feminine perspective

104
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,160
 as a mother bending over to feed her son.

105
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,120
 Here we are reminded that God represents the fullness

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,040
 of both the feminine and the masculine,

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,960
 that Adam and Eve were brought forth out of God's own image.

108
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,760
 This passage in Hosea provides us with a great window

109
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,880
 into the nurturing side of God.

110
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,080
 We see God lifting his children,

111
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
 tending to them, nourishing them,

112
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,160
 mothering them out of this season,

113
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,160
 this hard, struggling season they've just had in Egypt.

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,000
 We need to remember when Hosea was writing this,

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,280
 who he was writing it to and why he was writing it.

116
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,600
 So Hosea was an eighth century BC prophet,

117
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,880
 and he's speaking about Israel coming out of Egypt,

118
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,600
 which was 1500 years before Christ.

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,480
 Okay, so keep this all in your head.

120
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,120
 So Hosea is prophesying about and drawing from the past

121
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,240
 1500 years before the birth of Christ.

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,920
 He's living in the eighth century.

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,080
 And in this passage, he's prophesying

124
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,360
 to the 10 northern tribes,

125
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,360
 and they are in this very moment facing a war with Assyria.

126
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,400
 They are deeply in need of these comforting words

127
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,760
 that he brings them, this reminder of God's care.

128
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,000
 Hosea is drawing on God's faithfulness in the past

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,120
 to ignite hope in the hearts of God's people.

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,640
 Now we jump forward from Hosea to the birth of Jesus,

131
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,080
 first century AD.

132
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,760
 And Matthew, after the birth of Jesus,

133
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,520
 once again draws from the past,

134
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,520
 draws from the words of Hosea, quoting his words.

135
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,760
 To once again remind the Jewish people

136
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,960
 of God's faithfulness,

137
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 that their longing for a Messiah had now been fulfilled.

138
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,680
 I wanna go back and listen to Hosea's words,

139
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,600
 this prophecy that Matthew is drawing from.

140
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,920
 "But the more they were called,

141
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,160
 "the more they went away from me."

142
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,840
 Israel, after being freed physically,

143
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,400
 being brought out of Egypt,

144
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,240
 out of their oppression,

145
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,720
 are unable to keep their hearts free.

146
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,520
 They return back to enslavement,

147
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,320
 not to be enslaved by others,

148
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,360
 but this time to be enslaved themselves,

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,000
 and to enslave themselves.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,360
 With Jesus's birth, there's like this do-over

151
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,000
 where God symbolically shows through Jesus

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,880
 what He truly intended for His people.

153
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,960
 Jesus is brought up out of Egypt, just as Israel was,

154
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,280
 and where Israel fails to walk forward in their freedom,

155
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,280
 their healing, Jesus, through His ongoing life and ministry,

156
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,680
 demonstrates how to walk forward in obedience,

157
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,320
 fulfilling the plans God has for Him

158
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,320
 to bring life and freedom and healing to all peoples.

159
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,240
 Let's look at this a little deeper here,

160
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,960
 because I believe there are some parallels in this story

161
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,160
 that link to us today,

162
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,280
 that as we head into this Christmas period,

163
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,960
 I believe God wants to awaken us to.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,160
 Some 1,500 years before Jesus's birth,

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,640
 Israel's in captivity.

166
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,480
 They're enslaved in such a way

167
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,480
 that they're only able to live limited, contained lives.

168
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,520
 Then God comes with His servant Moses

169
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,160
 and miraculously frees them.

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
 They are set free physically.

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,080
 The Scriptures we mentioned early in Hosea

172
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,080
 show us that God wraps His people up in His tenderness.

173
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
 The imagery of a mother with her son,

174
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,320
 teaching them to walk, wrapping them up in her arms,

175
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,800
 healing them, leading them with kindness and love,

176
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,120
 lifting them, feeding them.

177
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
 But with all this tenderness,

178
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 the people of Israel seem unable

179
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,080
 to recognise God's presence in their life.

180
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,640
 Hosea captures this in verse three.

181
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,120
 "It was I," this is God speaking,

182
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,160
 "It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,

183
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
 taking them by the arms,

184
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,680
 but they did not realise that it was I who healed them."

185
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,720
 Has this ever bothered you?

186
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,200
 It's bothered me.

187
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,080
 Israel has just witnessed these incredible miracles.

188
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,440
 The 10 plagues of Egypt

189
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,440
 have systematically dismantled the gods of Egypt.

190
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,200
 And Israel has seen that with their own eyes.

191
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,640
 They then see the parting of the Red Sea.

192
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
 They walk through it, they experience it.

193
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,680
 But then at the first moments of hunger,

194
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,600
 oh, it would have been better for us back in Egypt.

195
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,960
 When Moses stays too long on the mountain,

196
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,080
 they create their own Baal,

197
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,400
 a god from the land that they were imprisoned in

198
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,160
 for hundreds of years.

199
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,040
 Their minds and their hearts return them

200
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,880
 to the place in which they were enslaved,

201
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,040
 in which they were limited, in which they were contained.

202
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,440
 Their thinking, their feelings, their actions

203
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,120
 are still being impacted by their past.

204
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,600
 There is something seriously amiss here.

205
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
 So I went researching

206
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,320
 and I read an article

207
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,640
 called "The Psychological Impact of Imprisonment."

208
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,720
 Not my usual reading,

209
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,640
 but it was a research paper written

210
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,200
 for the US Department of Health and Human Services

211
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
 that looked at the impact

212
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,920
 of long-term imprisonment on people,

213
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,320
 and it said this.

214
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,640
 Imprisonment, as in the removal of freedoms

215
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,240
 from people for extended periods of time,

216
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,160
 creates habits of thinking, feeling, and acting

217
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,000
 that can be dysfunctional.

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,320
 People become more and more accustomed

219
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,640
 to the restrictions that an enslaved

220
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,040
 or an imprisoned life imposes,

221
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,040
 so much so that these limitations become natural to them,

222
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,760
 that even when these conditions of life change,

223
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,440
 so even when people are released,

224
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,320
 when the limitations are removed,

225
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,920
 the counterproductive patterns remain.

226
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,720
 This is what it feels like

227
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,360
 reading this story of the Israelites.

228
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,920
 It feels dysfunctional.

229
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,480
 It feels like that they easily return

230
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,840
 to the habits that have enslaved them.

231
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,360
 How does this all relate to us in this Advent season?

232
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,280
 We have only been through three years of hardship,

233
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,080
 but in these three years, our lives have been limited.

234
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,280
 They have been contained.

235
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,080
 They have been constrained.

236
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,800
 We have had freedoms taken from us.

237
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,680
 Many of us have been limited, unable to work,

238
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,440
 unable to travel, unable to play sport.

239
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,280
 Many of us have been imprisoned by crippling anxiety.

240
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,840
 Feelings of being overwhelmed and trapped

241
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
 and feeling like there's no hope.

242
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:32,640
 And here in this moment, as we have Matthew reminding us

243
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,000
 that Jesus's coming heralds a new era of freedom,

244
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,080
 healing, hope for our future,

245
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,080
 I wonder whether we might carry

246
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,640
 some of the same heart and head issues

247
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,960
 that the Israelites carried with them out of Egypt.

248
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,760
 We may be starting to regain some of our physical freedoms,

249
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,800
 but I wonder whether the restrictions

250
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,640
 and the limitations we've experienced

251
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,080
 are continuing to keep us looking back

252
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,560
 instead of looking forward with hope.

253
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,920
 In this Advent season,

254
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,920
 can we clearly recognise God's presence and hope in our lives?

255
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,760
 Or have the last three years formed habits in our minds

256
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
 and in our hearts that are holding us back,

257
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,400
 keeping us enslaved, contained?

258
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,600
 I wonder whether we have become used

259
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,520
 to living limited, restricted lives.

260
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,840
 I wonder whether we become used to

261
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 being so limited in our lives,

262
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,240
 so limited in our lives that we forget God.

263
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,600
 It's so much that it actually feels natural.

264
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,360
 There is another part of this story

265
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,080
 that I believe God is highlighting to us today

266
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,720
 in this Advent season.

267
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,360
 Let me read those first verses again from Hosea.

268
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,080
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

269
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,400
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

270
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,680
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

271
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,080
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

 And I'm gonna read those to you.

273
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,640
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

274
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,960
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

275
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,280
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

276
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,600
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,920
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

278
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

279
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,560
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

280
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,880
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

281
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,200
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

282
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

283
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,920
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

284
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,280
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

285
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,600
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

286
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,920
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

287
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,240
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

288
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,680
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

289
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

290
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,360
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

 And I'm gonna read those to you.

292
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,000
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

294
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,680
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

295
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

296
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,440
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

357
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

358
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

359
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

360
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

361
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

362
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

363
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

364
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

365
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

366
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

367
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
 And I'm gonna read those to you.

368
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,040
 After the three days, let her do her four days of quarantine at home.

369
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,040
 Don't send her to an isolation hotel as well.

370
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
 But I was told, "No, no, she'll get COVID.

371
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
 She's in the room with you."

372
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 So I felt like I lost a lot of freedom.

373
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:27,040
 Sabae was picked up and she was taken to an isolation hotel.

374
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
 In that moment when she was taken out the door,

375
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
 so literally the door shut behind her,

376
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
 I just burst into tears.

377
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,040
 And I was like, "God, it's so unfair.

378
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,040
 And why can't you just intervene?"

379
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:49,040
 I was then taken to a different isolation hotel in a prison bus.

380
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,040
 No, not really.

381
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,040
 It just felt like a prison bus.

382
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
 Some of you were like, "Really? Prison bus came to take you?"

383
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
 No, not really.

384
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 But it felt like it.

385
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
 You know, you're already feeling sick.

386
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,040
 And I'd come from Australia, so I had bags and bags and things

387
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,040
 hanging off me and I'm trying to get on this bus.

388
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,040
 And nobody comes within 10 metres of you.

389
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
 Even the driver has sheets and sheets of plastic taped up

390
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,040
 so none of my air can get into him, you know.

391
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,040
 And when I got to the isolation hotel,

392
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,040
 I collapsed on the bed and everything came to a shuddering halt.

393
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
 All I had was stillness.

394
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,040
 All I had was waiting.

395
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,040
 And did I embrace this stillness?

396
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,040
 Did I see it as an opportunity, as a gift?

397
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
 No.

398
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,040
 After lots of frustrating tears, I went into survival mode.

399
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
 I went into doing.

400
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,040
 I dived into distractions.

401
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,040
 I switched off my thinking and emotions and I buried myself in Netflix.

402
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,040
 (Laughter)

403
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:11,040
 It would have remained like this except God did intervene,

404
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,040
 but not in the ways I'd asked him to.

405
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:22,040
 He found me in my waiting and encouraged me to finally be still with him.

406
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,040
 This is an extract from my journal.

407
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
 Thank you.

408
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,040
 Who knew that catching COVID would bring me to my knees

409
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
 and to a shuddering halt?

410
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,040
 And I'm thankful.

411
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,040
 In the depths of these dark days, I've gained perspective.

412
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,040
 I had grown so fragile, so brittle,

413
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,040
 that any problem threatened to break me.

414
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,040
 Years of stuff built up, stuff piled upon stuff,

415
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 getting more and more rigid.

416
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,040
 So catching COVID and the dramas that came with it shattered me,

417
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 turned me into a blubbering mess.

418
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,040
 But it also gave me time to be still,

419
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,040
 to watch the clouds drift across the sky

420
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 and to hear God's voice afresh.

421
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,040
 Be still and know that I am God.

422
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,040
 Matthew, speaking about the first Christmas,

423
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,040
 was asking the Jewish people to do the same thing,

424
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 to be still and recognise that this child that had been born was God,

425
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,040
 was the one they had been longing for.

426
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:47,040
 In true stillness, we find God afresh.

427
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,040
 However, like the Israelites waiting for Moses,

428
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
 we don't deal well with stillness.

429
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,040
 Instead, habits like constantly checking our social media feeds,

430
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,040
 which some of you are probably doing right now,

431
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,040
 playing games on our phones, it all numbs us.

432
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,040
 We dull ourselves to what is happening around us.

433
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,040
 We miss the beauty and we miss God's presence.

434
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,040
 We, like the Israelites, begin to fail to recognise His nearness

435
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,040
 and His interventions into our life.

436
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:33,040
 Maybe this Christmas is remembering that Jesus came out of Egypt

437
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 so that we could all come out of Egypt,

438
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 that we're not meant to stay wandering in the desert,

439
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,040
 living limited lives.

440
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,040
 Jesus came to make sure our lives were filled with love.

441
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:57,040
 He came so we can experience healing and move fully out of all that enslaves us

442
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
 into a future of hope.

443
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:06,040
 Matthew is reminding us this Christmas that the mothering heart of God,

444
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,040
 shown in Hosea, is now ours through Jesus.

445
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,040
 In Jesus, we have the healing, the care, the feeding, the nurturing

446
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,040
 that were shown in this Hosea passage.

447
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,040
 You know, one of the things that I love the most about raising my children,

448
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,040
 I have four children,

449
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,040
 that when they were babies and I was breastfeeding them,

450
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,040
 the thing that I used to love the most was feeding them in the night,

451
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,040
 in the quiet.

452
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,040
 There was this beautiful connection that I can't describe.

453
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:49,040
 And some of us today need to experience that mothering heart of God.

454
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:57,040
 We need to stay still long enough for us to recognise His nearness

455
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,040
 and His tender-heartedness towards us.

456
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,040
 This is great news for us this Christmas,

457
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,040
 that in the midst of suffering and hardship and struggle and disillusionment

458
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,040
 and brokenness, Jesus comes with the tenderness of a mother

459
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,040
 bending towards us, her children, to comfort us and restore our hope.

460
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,040
 So how is your hope right at this moment?

461
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 What kind of state is your heart in?

462
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,040
 How is your pace of life?

463
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,040
 Is there any true stillness?

464
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,040
 I don't know about you, but in the seasons we have endured

465
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
 and are continuing to endure,

466
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,040
 it's been pretty easy to live a constrained life.

467
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,040
 Get up, get through the day, reset, repeat.

468
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,040
 Who knows what I'm talking about?

469
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:10,040
 Not really thinking or reflecting on what the changes in our world

470
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 and in our city have done to our hearts, have done to our hope.

471
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,040
 So I ask you again, how is your hope right at this moment?

472
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 What kind of state is your heart in? Do you know?

473
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,040
 Matthew speaking about the original Christmas was trying to ignite hope

474
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,040
 in the hearts of his Jewish readers, to remind them that Jesus' birth

475
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,040
 could bring them out of their slavery, could set them free.

476
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
 Christmas is about hope.

477
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,040
 Maybe this Christmas is about reigniting hope,

478
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:57,040
 of stopping long enough, being still, to examine our battered hearts.

479
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,040
 And allowing the mothering heart of God to come alongside,

480
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:10,040
 to bring his healing, to bring genuine release from all that weighs us down.

481
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:15,040
 Can I just invite the band to head back up?

482
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,040
 As we draw to a close, there are some areas that I believe God

483
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
 wants to mother us in today.

484
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,040
 And I'd like to invite you to just close your eyes

485
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
 and just hear these things.

486
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
 Let them wash over you and just see whether some resonate,

487
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,040
 whether there's something that God just puts his finger on and says,

488
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,040
 "That, that's what I want to do for you today."

489
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,040
 God wants to deal with the impact of isolation,

490
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,040
 the impact that the shutting off and the withdrawing of freedoms

491
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
 has had on our hearts.

492
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:58,040
 He wants to set us free from living limited and constrained lives.

493
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:04,040
 He wants to deal with the habits of thinking, feeling and acting

494
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,040
 that have developed, that are causing dysfunction in our lives.

495
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:17,040
 Physical habits, like over eating, over working, over drinking,

496
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,040
 over gaming, Netflix binging.

497
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:29,040
 And mental habits, survival thinking, a mind that can't shut off,

498
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,040
 a mind that worries, is anxious, a mind that can't be still.

499
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,040
 He wants to address feelings of hopelessness.

500
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:47,040
 Some of you today have a deep sense of futurelessness.

501
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,040
 When you look at the future, you can't see it for you.

502
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,040
 God wants to wrap you up in his arms today

503
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,040
 and tenderly speak hope back into your life and your future.

504
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,040
 Jesus came out of Egypt to show us that he can free us

505
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,040
 from every enslavement, both physical and mental.

506
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,040
 We have a God who seeks to nurture us, to nourish us,

507
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,040
 to care for us, to heal us, to love us.

508
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:32,040
 So my question to you today is, can you be still

509
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,040
 and recognise his nearness because he's here.

510
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,040
 He's brought all that he is here.

511
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
 Let's stand together.

512
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:53,040
 We're going to take some time to be still.

513
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:59,040
 Stillness doesn't come easy.

514
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,040
 It's something we actually need to practise here in Hong Kong

515
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,040
 because as soon as we say, "Okay, I'm going to be still

516
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,040
 and I'm going to listen to God," suddenly we find ourselves

517
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
 in the kitchen making a cup of coffee and wondering

518
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,040
 how we got there because our minds just do not stop.

519
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
 So we have to practise stillness.

520
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,040
 We have to learn how to, when the distractions come,

521
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,040
 to stop them and push them back out and to say,

522
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 "No, no, no, no, no. I'm here with Jesus."

523
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,040
 So right now, push out the distractions.

524
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
 (soft music)

525
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,040
 And hold out your hands.

526
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:55,040
 And in your hands, picture the things that maybe have come

527
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,040
 into your heart as we've spoken this morning,

528
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,040
 the things that maybe you feel a tug,

529
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,040
 maybe something not quite right.

530
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,040
 And just see it in your hands as you just offer it to Jesus.

531
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,040
 Turn up with all that you are, all of your brokenness,

532
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,040
 all of the pieces.

533
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:27,040
 And right now, just be still

534
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,040
 and allow the tender-heartedness of God

535
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,040
 to wrap around you.

536
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
 (soft music)

537
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,040
 To hold you, to heal you,

538
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:49,040
 to pour such deep reservoirs of love over you

539
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,040
 that you'll feel like you're drowning in it

540
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
 'cause it can't be measured.

541
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,040
 It's so deep and wide and never-ending.

542
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,040
 Let's be still and listen.

543
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,040
 (soft music)

544
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,040
 For those of you online, wherever you are right now,

545
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,040
 whether you're on a bus or a train or at home or at work,

546
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,040
 God is with you.

547
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:48,040
 And it's no mistake you're listening to this message.

548
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,040
 Whether you're listening to it right now

549
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
 or you're listening to it in a month's time,

550
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:59,040
 God knew and He's with you.

551
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
 (soft music)

552
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:09,040
 The band's gonna start to sing over us.

553
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,040
 If you would like prayer,

554
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
 then keep your hands open in front of you

555
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,040
 and I'm gonna encourage this body

556
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:25,040
 to be brave and to become

557
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,040
 the mothering heart of God for you today.

558
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,040
 To come alongside and speak encouragement and life into you.

559
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:42,040
 Let's just take some time to do that now.

560
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,040
 (soft music)

561
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:54,040
 Can I encourage you to,

562
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,040
 I can see many people with their hands in front of them.

563
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
 Can I encourage you,

564
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,040
 if you're a Christian

565
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 and you carry the presence of God within you,

566
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:10,040
 that means you carry both the mothering

567
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,040
 and fathering heart of God within you.

568
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 You have the capacity for this.

569
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,040
 So look around you and find someone

570
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,040
 and trust that God can flow through you

571
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
 and be a blessing to that person.

572
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,040
 Let's do that for each other right now.

573
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,620
 (gentle music)
