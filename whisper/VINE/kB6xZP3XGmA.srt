1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 Hey, it is so good to be with you.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,960
 I was gone for a couple of months, not intentionally, but I had problems returning, so you can imagine

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
 what happened.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,280
 Yeah, but I'm just delighted to get to spend this time with you.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,120
 And I really believe that Jesus wants to meet us here today, has already met us through

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,600
 worship, and so my prayer also has been that he will meet us through this message.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:34,160
 So in 2002, I had the privilege of participating in a discipleship training school with Mercy

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,080
 Ships.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:44,840
 Now Mercy Ships is a medical missions organization, an NGO, that has medical hospital ships and

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,820
 that docks in countries to provide life-saving, life-transforming surgeries.

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,240
 And their mission is to bring hope and healing.

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:05,060
 And they do that both physically, but they also do that spiritually through their medical

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,680
 work and through sharing the love of Jesus.

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:18,600
 Now I joined them in Freetown in Sierra Leone, a country in West Africa, and I spent several

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,960
 months there, and then we sailed from Freetown to The Gambia, which is another small country

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
 in West Africa.

17
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
 Now when Mercy Ships heads to a new place, they've actually already done a ton of work

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,040
 before they ever get there.

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,600
 They send a ground team there.

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 They work with government officials, because you cannot just show up and, you know, decide

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,360
 you're going to do surgeries in a country.

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,780
 They work with health departments.

23
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,480
 They work with churches.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,160
 They work with other NGOs, with community leaders, to partner with them in their work,

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,840
 to spread the news about what they're doing, and to do this awesome and amazing medical

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
 work.

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,360
 So some of the things that they do is removing tumors.

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,480
 There's a common tumor in that area where a lot of people can't afford to care for,

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,840
 just grows, and actually can really take the dignity of people and also endanger their

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,680
 lives, so they remove tumors.

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,940
 They do surgeries on cleft lips.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,780
 They do surgery on clubbed feet and lots of other things, and restorative plastic surgery.

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,980
 So it's absolutely incredible that that physical, but also that spiritual transformation that

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
 they bring.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,360
 Now one of the things that Mercy Ship does when they then arrive in a dock is probably

36
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,480
 within a week or so, they schedule a massive medical screening.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,040
 So they--and all the people, you know, they've been spreading the news.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,860
 You can see her line, so it's up to like a thousand people or more.

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,080
 Sometimes they use stadiums to do that medical screening.

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,480
 And they come and they're examined by the ship's doctors, and then they schedule them

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
 for surgery.

42
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,140
 Now of course they put the most urgent surgeries first, but there is a lot of work to figure

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,200
 out, you know, when to schedule surgery, how long they take time in the ward to recover,

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,220
 but it's absolutely incredible.

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,840
 So every once in a while, also people are in that line that come that cannot be helped

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,320
 medically any longer.

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,040
 And so when that happens, they encourage people to go to a group of people from Mercy Ships

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,760
 that's there, that is there to care for them, but also to pray for supernatural healing.

49
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,420
 And people have been healed.

50
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,160
 Now as we were sailing from Sierra Leone to the Gambia--and by the way, this was the time

51
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:45,120
 when I figured out that I'm not meant to be on a ship because I get really seasick, but--and

52
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,820
 he said it was even the smoothest sailing possible, so I just stay away from them now.

53
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,840
 But as we were sailing, they told me that I would be one of the people who was going

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,920
 to pray for supernatural healing for the terminally ill.

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,160
 And I have to say, I was anxious.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
 I was freaked out.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
 I was a young guy.

58
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,880
 I had never prayed for a terminally ill person before.

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,520
 Now, I don't know about you, you know, whether you would be excited about that opportunity

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,120
 or whether that'd be something where you maybe feel like I feel, a little bit anxious, you're

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,720
 not 100% sure.

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,640
 So I ended up getting out of it, and here I have a confession.

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,160
 I was happy.

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,520
 And it's maybe not what you expected from one of your pastors.

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,760
 I wasn't a pastor back then, but I was really relieved.

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,800
 But looking back, I would say I actually missed an incredible opportunity to make myself available

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,400
 to God, for Him to work through me in prayer, to make myself available to the person who

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,760
 just has gotten a very difficult news, and to pray for them, to pray for healing, and

69
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:06,320
 in the very least, to bring God's comfort and care to that person in that situation.

70
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,620
 So I don't know what your experience and what your practice with prayer is.

71
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,800
 Maybe some of you, you pray a lot.

72
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,560
 Maybe you haven't prayed in a while, or it's been even quite hard to get yourself to pray,

73
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,560
 because you know the emotions that will come up when you go to God in prayer.

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,020
 Maybe you're one of those people who gets really excited to pray for healing.

75
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,260
 Maybe you've never done it, and you're just not sure.

76
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,920
 Whatever your prayer journey is, and I share it from you with my prayer journey, you know,

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,280
 this is part of my prayer journey.

78
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,600
 God wants to invite you today to be people who are bold in prayer, who pray for healing,

79
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,920
 who bring things to Jesus in prayer, and you know what?

80
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,600
 Jesus loves to partner with His people.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:00,640
 He loves to partner with the church when they pray, and He loves to powerfully release His

82
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:08,960
 healing, His renewing, His restoring, His forgiving work in the lives of people and

83
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,640
 communities, and we get to be part of that.

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,360
 He loves to partner with us.

85
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:24,380
 So we are in our final message of our sermon series, "How We Now Live," and the topic today

86
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,320
 is bold in prayer.

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,120
 And we're going to explore through this message, through the passage, we're going to look at

88
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,440
 what does it mean to be bold in prayer?

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
 What are we even talking about?

90
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,840
 And secondly, how might God be inviting us to be people who are bold in prayer?

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
 Does that sound good?

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
 Yes?

93
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
 All right.

94
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
 I'm excited.

95
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,400
 But I also want to say, sometimes when you talk about bold, being bold, we have certain

96
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,040
 images that come to our minds.

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,280
 Maybe it's like an extrovert, you know, who's super social.

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,400
 Maybe it's somebody who's praying in a loud voice, or maybe it's somebody who's very confident

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,720
 when they pray.

100
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
 But that's not what bold prayer is about.

101
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,000
 And I'm just saying this because I have the sense that some of us here today, we might

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,560
 not be feeling that bold, but I want you to know that being bold in prayer is also for

103
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 you.

104
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:32,120
 Now, let me set a little bit of context for this message and this passage.

105
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,540
 So James, the brother of Jesus, is writing to early Christian communities spread across

106
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,200
 the Mediterranean area, and the early Christians are actually going through very difficult

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
 times.

108
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,120
 They're being taken advantage of economically, so there's oppression, there's injustice,

109
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,280
 and there's just lots of trials that they are facing.

110
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:03,520
 And James is encouraging them to be people who live distinct Christian lives so that

111
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,080
 they don't look like their surrounding culture, but that the faith in Jesus is visible in

112
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,920
 how they live.

113
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,080
 And we've actually been talking about this, right?

114
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,680
 Joyful in hardship, strong in temptation, active in faith, faithful in words, and courageous

115
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,480
 in justice.

116
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,320
 And today we're talking about being bold in prayer.

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,040
 Now a lot of emphasis in James' book is also going through trials and waiting on God patiently,

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,400
 you know, that God will come through.

119
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:44,960
 But I love how James ends this letter in a very pastoral way, because he talks to this

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,480
 church about the present availability of Jesus.

121
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,960
 Jesus is available to you right now.

122
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,480
 You can come to him in prayer.

123
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,720
 And he loves the work.

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
 He loves to move when his people come, when his church comes.

125
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,160
 So James is encouraging them that Jesus is right there, and they can come to him with

126
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,480
 whatever it is that they're facing and going through, that he can act, and he does act

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,400
 right now, right here.

128
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,280
 So let's actually read the passage in James.

129
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:28,000
 We're in James chapter 5, and starting in verse 13 it says, "Is anyone among you in

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 trouble?

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,760
 Let them pray.

132
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,260
 Is anyone happy?

133
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,000
 Let them sing songs of praise.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,680
 Is anyone among you sick?

135
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,440
 Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in

136
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,920
 the name of the Lord.

137
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,600
 The prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.

138
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,840
 The Lord will raise them up.

139
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,520
 If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.

140
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,720
 Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be

141
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
 healed.

142
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,960
 The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.

143
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,720
 Elijah was a human being, even as we are.

144
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,080
 He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain for three and a half years.

145
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:25,000
 Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops."

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,440
 So as we're going to unpack this message, this passage, we're going to be asking a question,

147
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,200
 how is God inviting us to be people who are bold in prayer?

148
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,640
 So in verse 13, James talks about two circumstances.

149
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,040
 So it says, "Is anyone among you in trouble?

150
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
 Let them pray."

151
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
 First circumstance.

152
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,840
 If you're in trouble, pray.

153
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
 Second circumstance.

154
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
 "Is anyone happy?

155
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,320
 Let them sing songs of praise."

156
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:06,480
 Now, it would be easy to rush on, you know, just skim over this passage, because in some

157
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
 sense it's straightforward, but I think we need to pause here a little bit and reflect

158
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,160
 just a little bit more on what God wants to say to us.

159
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:24,320
 So the word that James uses for trouble, kakopatheo, it means internal distress caused by external

160
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,960
 circumstances.

161
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
 So that's one of the meanings.

162
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,120
 So it's an internal distress.

163
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,320
 Now, what is internal distress?

164
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,000
 We all know what we all have experienced.

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,520
 It's like these running thoughts.

166
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
 It's anxiousness.

167
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
 It's fear.

168
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
 It's panic.

169
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,120
 Maybe even expresses itself physically through headaches, stomach aches.

170
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,000
 So what do we do?

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,400
 Do we sit there and we complain to God, you know, when we're in trouble?

172
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,520
 Do we just sit there in frustration and maybe even try to deal with it ourselves?

173
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,800
 Or do we bring our troubles to Jesus?

174
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,400
 And I know that I think for a lot of us, our temptation there is that we actually don't

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,560
 bring our troubles to Jesus.

176
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,740
 That's why James is encouraging those early Christians, and also we are being encouraged

177
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,340
 to bring our troubles to Jesus, because we don't always do it.

178
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:23,640
 But Jesus is readily available, and He wants to work through our prayers.

179
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:31,400
 So being bold in prayer means that we're bringing the trouble that we are facing and experiencing

180
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,680
 to God in prayer.

181
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,240
 So we can bring that to Him.

182
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:45,800
 So what trouble are you experiencing right now that you have not brought to Jesus yet?

183
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,680
 And next James talks about, if you're happy, sing songs of praise.

184
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,360
 Now remember, the early Christian community, they're actually going through a difficult

185
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
 time, but yet there's still God's goodness.

186
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,880
 There's still moments of happiness in there.

187
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,340
 And James is encouraging them to praise God.

188
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,240
 Now we already don't always bring our troubles to God, but I think we're even less likely

189
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,740
 to bring our praises to God.

190
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,320
 And praise, by the way, is also a form of prayer.

191
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,920
 It's thanksgiving.

192
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,200
 And so when we think of being bold, I don't think that most of us think when we talk about

193
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,120
 being bold in prayer, we don't think about that actually part of bold prayer is praising

194
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,200
 God.

195
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,040
 That is a bold act.

196
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,760
 You know what makes it especially bold?

197
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,120
 When we're actually going through a hard time, but yet we choose to praise God for His goodness

198
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
 in our lives.

199
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
 That's bold.

200
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,320
 That's a bold declaration.

201
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:47,320
 And so James is inviting us to be bold in prayer, means being bold in our praise, to

202
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,600
 declare God's goodness boldly.

203
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,560
 That's powerful.

204
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,240
 When you know somebody is going through a tough time, you see them praising God, man,

205
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,440
 I'm touched.

206
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,440
 So we can be bold in our praise.

207
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,160
 Now in verse 14, there's another circumstance that James addresses where he encourages the

208
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,200
 church to be prayerful in.

209
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,120
 And they actually ask for prayer in this instance.

210
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,160
 It says, "Is anyone among you sick?

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,680
 Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in

212
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
 the name of the Lord."

213
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,560
 And I love how James empowers the sick person.

214
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,040
 You know, you can call on others and ask others to pray for you.

215
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,240
 And here specifically, he's encouraging for the people to call on the elders.

216
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,280
 Now who are the elders?

217
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,800
 Well, elders are spiritual leaders of a community.

218
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,960
 They oversee the community, they shepherd the community.

219
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,680
 And so we're supposed to call on the elders to anoint us and to pray over us in the name

220
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
 of the Lord.

221
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,440
 Now what is anointing all about?

222
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
 This anointing with oil.

223
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,720
 Well, one of the meanings is a symbolic meaning that means that a person is being set apart

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
 for God's special care and attention.

225
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,920
 You know, God, we're setting this person apart for God's special care and attention.

226
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
 I love that.

227
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
 Isn't that beautiful?

228
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,240
 Like that symbolism of that?

229
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,600
 And then it's also symbolism of the power of the healing of Jesus, that Jesus is powerful

230
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,520
 and able to heal.

231
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,400
 But then we're also told that the elders are supposed to pray in the name of the Lord.

232
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,800
 Now praying, that means praying in the name of Jesus.

233
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,400
 Jesus is our Lord and he has given us authority, he has given elders authority to act on his

234
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,960
 authority and by his power when we pray.

235
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,320
 Now if you think about it, when Jesus sends out the disciples first in this mission to

236
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,680
 Israel, later on all of us, he sends us with his authority.

237
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,840
 So when we pray in the name of Jesus, we're doing that on behalf of Jesus and by his power.

238
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,720
 You are doing that on behalf of Jesus and by his power.

239
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,640
 And he works through the prayers.

240
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:16,800
 Now of course, not just elders can pray and anoint, you know, for healing and God works

241
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,120
 in this church a lot of times, also through anyone else, you know, who anoints a sick

242
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,560
 person and prays for healing.

243
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,400
 But he has given elders a special authority in the church to pray for healing.

244
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,240
 So we can come to them and we can ask for prayers.

245
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:41,040
 So being bold in prayer involves also praying over those who are sick for supernatural healing.

246
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:49,080
 Now I want to encourage you with a testimony from actually Pastor Ellison's mom.

247
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,040
 So I'll read it to you.

248
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,720
 On December 1st last year, my health took a dramatic turn for the worse.

249
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,880
 This was very unusual.

250
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,320
 I'm a very healthy and active person.

251
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,840
 I was eating well and doing regular exercise.

252
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,080
 But after having a fever for a few days, I fainted at home and found myself unconscious

253
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,840
 in the ICU.

254
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:20,360
 I was suffering from an infection which meant the brain was swelling out of control to the

255
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,440
 point where it was life threatening.

256
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,560
 They managed to get that under control, but that was just the beginning.

257
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:37,120
 What followed was a four-month battle for my life.

258
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
 Doctors were baffled.

259
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
 They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me.

260
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,440
 I had a consistent fever of more than 40 degrees Celsius.

261
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,920
 Growth were found in my lungs, in my liver, and in my brain.

262
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,520
 I was constantly in and out of consciousness.

263
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,240
 And my family were not able to visit me due to COVID restrictions.

264
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,200
 They told my family that I was facing a serious form of cancer which had spread all over my

265
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,480
 body.

266
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,400
 The doctor even told my family that they should be prepared to say goodbye at any moment.

267
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,800
 But it didn't make any sense.

268
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,600
 After all I said beforehand, I was actually a healthy person and I didn't have any cancer-like

269
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,320
 symptoms at all.

270
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,880
 And so we prayed.

271
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,540
 My family prayed.

272
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,600
 My church prayed.

273
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,120
 My colleagues prayed.

274
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,040
 And God began to work his healing.

275
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,560
 After almost five months in the hospital, I was finally discharged.

276
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,400
 Turns out it wasn't cancer in the end.

277
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,080
 I still don't know the answer to what actually caused the sickness.

278
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,040
 The best the doctors could tell me was that it was a mysterious infection.

279
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,880
 In the end, it doesn't matter.

280
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,120
 I know that Jesus was the one who healed me.

281
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,440
 And he will continue to be with me for the rest of my life.

282
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,160
 Praise God.

283
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:13,480
 So we can ask for healing.

284
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,360
 God has the power to release this healing on his people.

285
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,200
 So now in our passage, James turns to how God works through prayer.

286
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:32,520
 So in verse 15, it says, "And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.

287
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,000
 The Lord will raise them up.

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,560
 If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."

289
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,480
 So here we're told that a person is made well through the prayer of faith, that they can

290
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,520
 be healed through the prayer of faith.

291
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,600
 Now what is the prayer of faith?

292
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,100
 Well a prayer of faith means that we have trust in the Lord, that he is able to heal.

293
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,920
 But it also means that there is a commitment to Jesus, that we're single-minded and not

294
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,360
 double-minded, that we're committed to following and living the life of Jesus.

295
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,080
 Doesn't mean we do that perfectly.

296
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,320
 So the prayer of faith is offered by somebody who trusts God, who trusts Jesus, and who

297
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,240
 is committed to Jesus.

298
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,600
 Sometimes when we pray, there's also special faith that is released and given to us to

299
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 pray for somebody for supernatural healing.

300
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,380
 As we're praying that, the Holy Spirit reveals that God wants to heal that person.

301
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:35,160
 And so when that happens, we can lean into that faith that God has given us to pray for

302
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,120
 that supernatural healing.

303
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:49,760
 Now inherent in a prayer of faith is also that we are submitting to God's will.

304
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,080
 So whether or not Jesus does his healing work in a person's life is up to God.

305
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,020
 You know, we pray the prayer and we're called to ask for healing.

306
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:04,380
 We should pray for that, but then ultimately it's up for God to decide what he does in

307
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,380
 this person's life.

308
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,600
 And so we just entrust that to him and we hand that over to him.

309
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,920
 You know what I love though is that Jesus invites all of us, all of us, you might not

310
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,140
 think of yourself that way, but all of us into this work.

311
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,620
 Because if you're a follower of Jesus, you have been sent with authority.

312
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,100
 And God loves to partner with us.

313
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,060
 Church, you have a mission.

314
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,500
 We have the mission to share the gospel.

315
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,940
 We have the mission to just serve and love people and contribute to the flourishing of

316
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,940
 society.

317
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,640
 But you also have a mission to pray.

318
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,380
 And God wants to release his healing, his redeeming, his renewing, his forgiving work

319
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,660
 through prayer.

320
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,820
 And he allows us to partner with him in that.

321
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,500
 It's powerful and it's beautiful and it's encouraging that we get to co-labor with God.

322
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,060
 Now God does the healing.

323
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,380
 We don't do the healing, but he allows us to be part of the process.

324
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:12,100
 And it's so encouraging when we experience God's work through our prayers.

325
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:25,980
 So next, James, he also talks about spiritual healing, that God does not just want to heal

326
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,060
 us physically, but he also wants to do some spiritual healing and really some spiritual

327
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,020
 healing through prayer.

328
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,380
 So in verse, especially verse 16, we're encouraged, and this is the community being encouraged.

329
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,380
 This takes place in the community.

330
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,740
 It says, "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you

331
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
 may be healed."

332
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,620
 So we're encouraged to confess our sins to each other.

333
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,980
 We're told that God wants to release his healing when we do that.

334
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,380
 Now why is James encouraging the Christian community to do this?

335
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,820
 Just one second.

336
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,980
 Why is James encouraging the Christian community to do this?

337
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,260
 Well, he knows that we're broken people.

338
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,420
 Yes, we've experienced Jesus' forgiveness and a new life in him, but we still stumble.

339
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:25,180
 We still sin against God, against others, and then we're not fully being the people

340
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,100
 that God has created us to be.

341
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,580
 But we can come to him and we can confess our sins and we can pray for each other, and

342
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:41,940
 he releases his healing to renew us, to forgive us, and to give us the grace to move forward

343
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,100
 and live by his grace.

344
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,980
 Now a lot of times when we think of sin, we think of just big type of things like murder

345
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:56,460
 or theft, and of course that is part of it, but Jesus actually talks about that sin is

346
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,460
 a hard issue.

347
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,860
 So here are some words from Jesus from the Gospel of Mark, chapter 7, verse 20 through

348
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
 23.

349
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,300
 He says, "What comes out of a person is what defiles them, for it is from within, out of

350
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,140
 a person's heart, that evil thoughts come.

351
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:19,020
 Sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander,

352
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,460
 arrogance, and folly.

353
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:26,340
 All these evils come from inside and defile a person."

354
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,420
 So while we have beautiful and good things in our hearts, but there is also still sin

355
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,460
 in our hearts.

356
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,700
 And if we would just look at this past week, if all that has happened in our hearts, all

357
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:49,140
 our thoughts, our judgment, our lust, our envy, it's not very pretty.

358
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,280
 It's not very pretty.

359
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,580
 And I know I would be deeply embarrassed if you could see all of that that has happened

360
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,220
 here.

361
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:04,180
 And so we're encouraged to bring this heart issue that we have to Jesus for him to renew

362
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:11,500
 us, to restore us, and to do his forgiving and healing work in our lives.

363
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 And a friend and also scholar, Mary Kate Morris, she writes, "Confession is part of the daily

364
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,540
 rhythm of prayer."

365
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,620
 It's actually something we can do daily.

366
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:29,940
 It reminds us that love and wholeness is in God and not in our effort.

367
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,260
 You know, we're not whole because of what we do.

368
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,260
 We're whole because of what Jesus has done.

369
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,460
 We're whole because we stand in his grace, because we receive his forgiveness.

370
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,480
 And he wants to release this wholeness and this love in which we stand when we confess

371
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
 our sins.

372
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:53,360
 Now, I know that when I've confessed my sins to Chris, to close friends, and asked them

373
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:02,200
 to pray with me, that Jesus, this healing work is released, and guilt and shame is lifted.

374
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,640
 You know, and there's a freshness and a newness.

375
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,320
 And also kind of shuts down the enemy who's accusing us.

376
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,440
 So when we confess our sins to each other, it's powerful.

377
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,920
 And I cannot actually think of something more bold than share the stuff that's not so pretty

378
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,080
 with somebody and ask to pray with each other about this, right?

379
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,360
 So again, being bold in prayer is maybe a little bit different than what we thought.

380
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,800
 But it's also being vulnerable and confessing our sins to each other.

381
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,560
 And Jesus then releases his healing work on his people.

382
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,160
 So being bold in prayer is regularly confessing our sin, which releases God's forgiveness

383
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,040
 and healing work in our lives.

384
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:52,280
 Now finally, James goes on and he reminds us of the effectiveness and the power that

385
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
 is in prayer.

386
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,320
 And again, why does James need to remind us?

387
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,560
 Well, because we forget how powerful prayer is.

388
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,360
 We underestimate it.

389
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,240
 We underestimate how Jesus wants to meet us and work through it when we come to him in

390
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,080
 prayer.

391
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:18,880
 So in verse 16, the last part, it says, "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and

392
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,320
 effective."

393
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,040
 Now what is a righteous person?

394
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
 Am I one of them?

395
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,840
 You might be wondering, "Does that count for me?"

396
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,920
 Well, here's what a righteous person is.

397
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,200
 A righteous person is a person who is a Christian who stands in the grace of God, not their

398
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
 own goodness.

399
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:44,360
 You know, somebody who has received that forgiveness and grace and who as the child of God can

400
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,240
 call on God and has access to Jesus, you know, to work through prayer.

401
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,840
 And so then next, James illustrates how powerful our prayers are, and that's to encourage us.

402
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,880
 And so in verse 17, he talks, he reminds the Christian community of the story of the prophet

403
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 of Elijah.

404
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,800
 He says, "Elijah was a human being, even as we are.

405
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,400
 He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three

406
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,800
 and a half years.

407
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,080
 Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced crops."

408
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,880
 Wow.

409
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,760
 Now it's easy to kind of raise an objection.

410
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,160
 Actually James was anticipating that people would object, "Well, you know, Elijah, he

411
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,320
 was a prophet, he had like special access to God."

412
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,440
 But actually he said, "Elijah was a human.

413
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,640
 He was a person like you and me, that there is no difference.

414
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,080
 He also had his human weaknesses.

415
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,120
 He had his anxious thoughts.

416
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,680
 He had all of that."

417
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:54,480
 And so we can, anyone, we all are on the same ground when we come to Jesus in prayer.

418
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,040
 There's a quote I want to share with you from a professor and pastor.

419
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,280
 He says, "There are no extraordinary humans with unique access to God, just an extraordinary

420
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:14,760
 God whose power is available to all who are willing to pray."

421
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,600
 So right now I want to invite the worship team to come up, and I want to share with

422
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:27,640
 you a testimony of this extraordinary God and how he has met me in my life.

423
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,680
 This is actually a continuation of the story with Mercy Ships.

424
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,040
 So I finished my time with Mercy Ships, and I went home to Germany.

425
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,880
 I was with my parents.

426
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,840
 So beforehand I was working in a business world, and I felt that God was calling me

427
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,520
 to shift to work in a church, to be a pastor, to be a missionary, to work in that direction.

428
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,800
 And but now I had some challenges because I had borrowed money from my parents, $10,000

429
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:02,720
 U.S. dollars, which by now would be like $20,000 with inflation, you know, from 20 years ago.

430
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,520
 And I needed to pay them back.

431
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,640
 Then I didn't know where to go for seminary.

432
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,180
 I didn't know much about seminaries.

433
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
 So where would I go?

434
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,520
 Where would I live?

435
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,000
 Then on top of it, seminary also costs, so like how am I going to pay for this?

436
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,040
 But it was really cool.

437
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:24,440
 Like God, I realized if God is calling me to do this, you know, he can provide for me.

438
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,400
 And so I prayed for God's provision.

439
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,800
 There was all these I don't knows.

440
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,920
 You know, I don't know where I will go.

441
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,040
 I don't know how I will pay.

442
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,400
 I don't know how I'll even get into seminary.

443
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,080
 But God answered and provided for me.

444
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,400
 I ended up getting a full scholarship to seminary.

445
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,560
 When does that ever happen?

446
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:54,760
 For anyone who's in seminary, they're a little stingy with giving scholarships.

447
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:02,320
 And then after my first year, I got a job as a resident chaplain at Baylor University.

448
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,960
 And I got free housing, free food, free Wi-Fi, free gas and electric.

449
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,760
 And I even got a little stipend that after two years allowed me to pay my parents back.

450
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
 Isn't that amazing?

451
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:25,760
 And so God provided for me in my case financially and through that job.

452
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,160
 But maybe in your case, his provision is different.

453
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,760
 Maybe it's a provision of guidance when you don't know which direction to go.

454
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,920
 Maybe it's a provision of a friendship, you know, when you're really just longing for

455
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,640
 a good friend or for a relationship.

456
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,000
 So God provides in different ways.

457
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,120
 But right now, instead of also just talking about prayer, I actually want to lead us into

458
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,320
 a time of prayer.

459
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,760
 So in the next seven to ten minutes, we're going to take some time to pray together,

460
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,920
 to pray with each other.

461
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,560
 Now this is something we practice at the Vine now quite regularly where we take some time.

462
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,280
 You know, you turn to somebody you know, you turn maybe to a friend or you introduce yourself

463
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,640
 to someone and you share with each other how you can pray for each other and then we just

464
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
 pray.

465
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,560
 So we're going to take five to seven minutes to do that right now.

466
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,240
 If you're online, Chapman will give you some instructions for how you can engage in this

467
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
 time.

468
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,320
 So let's do this right now.

469
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,720
 Let's turn to each other.

470
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,440
 Let's bring our prayer to Jesus who is available, who loves to work through the prayers of his

471
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,560
 people.

472
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
 Let's do this right now.

473
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:45,600
 Then in a few minutes, I'll come back and I'll wrap up our time.
