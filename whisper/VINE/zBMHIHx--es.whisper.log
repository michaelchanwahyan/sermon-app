[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   So there's this day. There's this day where Peter is going to the temple
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   courts to pray. And it's a day just like every day where Peter would gather into
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.120]   the temple to pray. But on this day he walks past the gate of beautiful, the
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.420]   gate that you pass into to get to the temple steps. And there's a beggar who's
[00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.200]   there every single day. The same way that Peter goes into the temple every day to
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.200]   pray, the beggar is there every day asking for alms, for finances, for gifts.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:37.120]   On this day, for some reason, Peter stops and pays attention.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.280]   The Bible tells us that compassion stirs in Peter and he stops and he looks at this
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.240]   man and the man looks up at him with with hope in his eyes. You're gonna give
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.360]   to me today. And he stretches out his hands and Peter tells the man, look at me.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.120]   The man looks at him directly with his hands out waiting for his alms. Peter
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.160]   says this crazy thing. He says, "Silver or gold I do not have." In other words, I
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.240]   don't have actually the thing that you're asking for in this moment. But I
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.360]   do have something. He says this, he says, "In the name of Jesus, walk." And this
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.880]   beggar's like, "It's not what I expected." And Peter reaches his hand down and
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.000]   grabs this man's hands and he says, "In the name of Jesus, walk." And the man
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   stands and he walks. And I love this moment in the Bible because it shows us
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.800]   something quite significant. That sometimes we think we know what we need.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.600]   Sometimes we think we have the list worked out, like it's this thing that I
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.040]   need today, you know. And we kind of come to God with that kind of laundry list of
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.760]   the stuff that we know we need. And I love Peter's response. He's like, "I do not
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.880]   have anything I can offer. Like I don't have the silver. I don't have the gold. I
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.080]   don't have the money. I can't meet the needs that you're bringing right now. But I do
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.760]   have one that can." So in his name, he says, "Not in my name. Not in the name of this
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.000]   temple. Not in the name of the things that are being worshipped. Not in the
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.200]   name of this city. Not in the name of anything else other than Jesus. But in
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.600]   his name you could walk. I can't get money from him to give to you. But by the
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.720]   Spirit of God, through the power of his name, you can walk." And I love this idea
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.280]   because I think about us. And we'd like to think that we're Peter, but so often
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.920]   we're the beggar. And I wonder whether today we might be looking to Jesus and
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.720]   saying, "God, I want X, Y, and Z." And what God is saying to us is, "Here's the thing
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.520]   that I actually want from you today. Here's the miracle. Here's the transformation.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.440]   Here's the thing that can actually change what is going on in your life
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.680]   right now." And I want to pray the name of Jesus over you. I don't personally know
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   what's going on in all of your lives. You're my church. I love every single one
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.480]   of you. Hi. If you're watching online right now, I love you too, wherever you
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.000]   are. But I don't know all of your needs. I don't know what you've come in here
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.640]   today. I don't know what you're carrying. I don't know what's going on. What I do
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.800]   know is that I do not have anything to offer you. A church, ultimately. An
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.520]   organization, ultimately nothing. But I do know the one who can help you. His name
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.160]   is Jesus. So I want to pray for Jesus to do something in your life. Not me, not the
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.360]   band, not a church. Jesus. So if you'd like to receive some prayer today, I want to
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.520]   just invite you just to open your hands. We do that here at the Vine. It's just a
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.680]   symbol of saying to the Lord, I'm open before you. And maybe you have something
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.640]   you want to bring. Maybe you picture yourself at the gate of beautiful this
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.640]   morning. And there's some needs in your life. God knows those needs. He loves you
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.800]   deeply. Some of you, it's stress and anxiety. Some of you, it's living up to
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.560]   expectations that others have placed upon you. And the weight, the crushing
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.280]   weight of living up to those expectations. And you're doubting your
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.560]   gifts. You're doubting your skills. That you can meet those expectations. Some of
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.520]   you in this room, it might be work-related. It might be relationship
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.560]   related. But there are some needs for you. And I want you to know that I cannot help
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.520]   you, but Jesus can. And so in the name of Jesus, I pray that the very one who raised
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.000]   from the death, that his spirit would come now and raise in you what it is
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.680]   that you are in need of. And what he sees is the thing that you need the most. Lord,
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.600]   I pray that people would walk in this room in the name of Jesus, like they've
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.320]   never walked before, Lord. I want to pray for liberation from things that are
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.480]   holding us back like never before, Lord. I want to pray for the rising up, Lord, of
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.000]   the testimony of your goodness in us like never before, Lord. We all have needs.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.400]   We're all broken, Lord, here today. But praise God we know the name that is
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.720]   above every name. And I want you to remember that that miracle did not take
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.360]   place in the temple. That that miracle didn't take place in the Holy of Holies,
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.320]   where we'd most expect the presence of God to meet his people. That miracle took
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.040]   place on the streets outside of the church. And Lord, we need some miracles in
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.120]   the streets of our city in this time and in this hour, Lord. So we want to pray,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.360]   Lord, that we wouldn't just be contained to the reality of this 90 minutes and a
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.960]   Sunday in the service, Lord, but you would be sending out men and women to be
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.060]   Peters in this place to see the needs of the broken people around us and to bring
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.280]   the name of Jesus to the streets of this city, Lord. Would you rise up this
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.880]   generation, Lord, that is willing to say, "I don't have anything. I ain't got the
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.640]   strategy. I don't know how to work it out. The politics is too overwhelming. The
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.600]   stuff that's going on with COVID, it's too overwhelming. I don't know what to do."
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.720]   But in the name of Jesus, walk Hong Kong. Walk. Get up. Get up out of what you're
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.800]   facing right now. You can rise up again and you can see your hope for the future
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.440]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   Father, you have no rival. I wonder whether we could sing that again. I can't
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.440]   sing, so I'm not gonna sing it, but Emma, you're gonna sing it. You have no rival,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.920]   Lord. Let's sing this church. Come on. Yes, God.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:36.640]   Death could not hold you. The bell tolled before you. You silenced the bow of sin and grave.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:52.480]   Oh, the heavens are roaring. The praise of your glory. For you are ready to rise again.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:06.560]   You have no rival. You have no equal. Now and forever, God, you reign.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:20.640]   Yours is the kingdom. Yours is the glory. Yours is the name above all names.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:32.400]   What a powerful name it is. What a powerful name it is. The name of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:42.240]   Oh, Jesus. What a powerful name it is. And nothing can stand against.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:53.440]   What a powerful name it is. The name. You have no rival. You have no rival.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:04.160]   You have no equal. Now and forever, God, you reign.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:18.080]   Yours is the kingdom. Yours is the glory. Yours is the name above all names.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:32.480]   What a powerful name it is. What a powerful name it is. The name of Jesus Christ, my King.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:39.760]   What a powerful name it is. And nothing can stand against.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:47.120]   What a powerful name it is. The name of Jesus.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.400]   Father, I just thank you that you are here, Lord.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.360]   I thank you that we don't worship a God that's distant, up on some cloud, playing a harp.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.440]   But we worship a God who comes into the nitty gritties of our lives,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.400]   the things that we struggle with, our brokenness, the things that we're afraid of,
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:11.200]   the humanness of us all. And you come as a human, fully God, fully human, with us, the incarnation.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.600]   And Lord, as we open up your word today, we do so with this eager anticipation of
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.720]   wanting to become more and more like your son, Jesus, recognizing that we're all on a journey, Lord.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.240]   And Lord, we're excited, excited about what you want to say and how you want to do it amongst us today.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.160]   So Lord, we bring all these things to you. We pray you'd help us to walk.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.760]   We pray this in Jesus' name. Everyone says, "Amen, amen."
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.800]   Hey, why don't you stay down, turn around, say hi to someone.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:48.000]   Welcome somebody. Be friendly. Get somebody's name.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.480]   Maybe a phone number if you like to look at them. No, don't do that. Don't do that.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:59.360]   All right, all right, all right. I've never started a message like Matthew McConaughey before.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.520]   All right, all right, all right. But there you go. Welcome, if you're joining us online,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.040]   it's so great to have you two with us. And we're grateful wherever you're tuning in from around the world.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   We're so glad that you're here. We're in week seven. It's the final week of a seven-part series
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.560]   we've been doing that we've called An Alternative Society, based on the book of Philippians.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.320]   Paul writing to the church in Philippi. And Paul's writing to 30 or so people. And he's got a passion.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.600]   He's writing to them because they're under persecution. These are 30 people meeting in a
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.760]   small house, worshipping Jesus. The only people in Philippi holding Jesus' name in their hearts.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.040]   And they're under persecution. It wasn't an easy city for them to acknowledge Jesus. Not only are
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.560]   they under persecution, but they're struggling with divisions amongst them. And when persecution
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:53.520]   comes, it's so easy to fight amongst each other. And Paul writes them this letter. And he says,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:00.240]   "I want you to understand that when you come together as this idea of church, when you gather
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   together, it's because you have a public witness of your private spirituality. It's because God has
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.040]   formed and shaped you, brought you together, so you would have something to say to society around you
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.480]   about who Jesus is, about his hands and his feet, his heart, his character, his compassion, that God
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.840]   wants us, the church, to be something of the expression of Jesus in the world." So he writes
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.360]   this letter and he says, "I want you to be an alternative society within society. I don't want
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.760]   the church to escape to some monastery up on a hill and wag a judging finger at all the broken
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:42.000]   stuff in the world. No, I want my church planted within the very fabric of society, but living as
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   citizens of heaven in that society." In other words, your values and the way you are and the way you
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.520]   live looks different from the rest of the world. Not in some rebellious kind of thing, not in some
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:01.520]   weird kind of thing, but in a, "Hey, this is a new and fresh vision of life. There is another way of
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:10.080]   being human." And so he tells them that there is a new way to be. The whole of the beautiful thing
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.120]   about the letter to Philippi is Paul is saying, "There is this new way of life." He says, "It looks
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.200]   like a new way to pray. It looks like a new way to lead amongst each other. It looks like a new way
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.880]   to have unity together. It's a new way to understand holiness now that Christ has died and raised
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.800]   again. And yes, it's also a new way to die. We die to ourselves as we come into this profound
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.960]   understanding of the work of the cross and our resurrection off the back of the work of the cross."
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:45.120]   And he lays out step by step a new way for them to show the world who Jesus truly is. And if I was
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.680]   to pull together all the threads that we've been teaching over the last six weeks, I would put it
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:56.080]   something like this. Let me read this to you. "An alternative society is born out of a call to
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.720]   publicly administer the values of God's kingdom, to pray with the other in mind, to lead from a place
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.560]   of vulnerability, find unity through the love of Christ, encounter holiness in its presence with
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:16.240]   Jesus, hold to the mindset of humility and sacrifice as revealed in the cross." This is
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:22.000]   like Paul telling the church in Philippi, "If you were to live like this, you would be able to model
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.360]   for the world a new way to live. Like this is what it's all about." And I had this sense in my spirit
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.600]   as we've been doing this series that this is what God is asking of the church in Hong Kong in this
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   time and in this hour. In a city where we're all struggling with the changes that are taking place
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.520]   in a global pandemic that we're wrestling with that's disrupted all of our lives in a shifting
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.200]   and changing political system. The reality that on Friday there is an election being called the
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.560]   Patriots election. And then there's this idea that there's this voting to take place for the future
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.480]   of the government of the city. All of that. We should be leaning into it as the church of Jesus
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:07.040]   living like this. Modeling to the world that there is something different in the uncertainty
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.560]   and the brokenness and the struggle and the strife of what's going on right now. Are you with me,
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:19.200]   church? All right. But there's one question that remains unanswered.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.760]   And it's a question that concerned Paul and I think it should concern us as well. The question
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.200]   is this. What is it that actually marks us as this alternative society in the world around us?
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:41.600]   Like what is it actually in us that reveals this character and this nature of Christ to the world
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:48.160]   that desperately needs to see it? What should be manifest in us that shows the world something of
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:59.360]   the person of Jesus? Well, for Paul, the answer was simple. It was joy. Joy. The idea that there
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:07.600]   is possible to have an internal, deeply dwelling sense of delight and joy in me, regardless of
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.840]   what might be happening around me, regardless of what might be happening in the city, happening in
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:17.760]   my personal life, happening in my workplace, that I'm able to find this deep-scented abiding
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:25.360]   overflowing sense of joy. That, Paul says, is the one thing that will set you apart. That is the
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.640]   thing that if people were to see it, they would be like, "There's something going on that's
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.800]   different with this group of people that no matter how hard it is, there is still joy."
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   Which is a real problem for us, because let's be honest. I think if you were to ask a non-Christian
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.440]   what's the first thing that comes to their mind when they think of Christians, I doubt it's the
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:56.560]   word joyful. Are you with me, church? Let's be honest with ourselves today. I mean, if we're
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.440]   really honest with ourselves, I think we'd realize that there's just as much stress, anxiety, just as
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.760]   much brokenness, just as much negativity, just as much struggle and strife and trial as any other
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.600]   segment in society. And that might okay be the case, because we're humans walking into this
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.560]   world. But Paul's saying if you're just exactly like everybody else, you can go through all of
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:27.600]   that stuff and yet still find joy. And he's saying that has to be what marks us. But the reality is
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:36.720]   it's so often just not the case. And we wonder why that is. And so here's what I want to do today.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:43.520]   I want to spend the next chunk of minutes with you. And I want to unpack the glorious vision
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.560]   the Bible has about joy. Because here's my premise. I think we've got joy all wrong.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.520]   I think one of the reasons why we wouldn't say that joy is the first thing we think about when
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.200]   we think of the church is because I think we're all defining joy wrong. And I think if we could
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.520]   actually begin to understand what Paul has on his heart and his passion when he thinks about joy,
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.560]   I think if we could actually dive in quite deeply today to this understanding, this concept of joy,
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.760]   I think it might help us all to rise up differently in this time and in this hour.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.800]   And let me just be bold with you and say this. If you are somebody who takes notes,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.480]   you need to take notes today. And let me also boldly say this. If you're somebody who doesn't
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:31.360]   take notes on a Sunday, i.e. most of you, you might want to take notes today. I honestly,
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.440]   generally believe that what I'm about to share over the next 30 minutes can truly revolutionize
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:45.280]   your life. It's a big call. And the reason why I think that is because I'm about to show you
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:52.800]   why it is that you can have joy in every moment of your life, whether healthy or sick,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.960]   whether doing well or struggling, whatever might be happening, you can do all things in Christ
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.240]   Jesus who gives you strength. So let me tell you about this. Are you ready? Joy is mentioned 15
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.840]   times in the book of Philippians. It's the second most mentioned in all of the books of the New
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   Testament. The only other one that mentions it more is Luke, and Luke is like five times bigger
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:22.320]   than Philippians. Philippians is all about joy. Paul is writing to the church, and in every single
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.440]   chapter, it's the only theme in the whole book of Philippians that is the consistent theme
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.160]   throughout the whole book. He talks constantly to them about joy. I did the easy work for you,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.360]   and I threw up a bunch of those on a neat little PowerPoint that is now behind me. Have a look at
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.880]   some of these passages. "Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord. I rejoice greatly
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.520]   in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Then make my joy complete by being
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.080]   light-minded, having the same love, being one in the same spirit of mine. In all my prayers,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.520]   for all of you, I always pray with joy." Ah, but what does it matter? The important thing is that
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:04.560]   in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. Because of this, I rejoice.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.080]   I mean, constantly throughout the letter, the epistles become known as the epistle of joy
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.920]   because Paul is consistently telling them, "We can know joy. Joy should mark and shape us as
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.800]   the people of Christ." You have to remember that Paul is writing this letter from prison.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.680]   There's nothing about Paul's circumstances or situations that are joyful. Not only is he in
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.280]   prison, he's in prison awaiting trial. And the reality is that the trial is most likely to lead
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:40.320]   him to his execution on a cross. In other words, Paul is literally days away from potential death.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:46.880]   And he's writing a letter to his church, and he's like, "I feel joy. I know joy. I'm so joying. I'm
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.680]   rejoicing. You should know joy. I want your best joy. It's joy, joy, joy." And you're like, "What
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:20:00.560]   are you talking about? Because if it was me, I would not have joy." Paul's doing something. He's
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.760]   modeling something for his church. He's basically saying this, "There is power in the public
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:13.040]   demonstration of joy." Public demonstration. Think of it this way. I love this. Could you imagine
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.360]   what it would have been like for all the people that were trying to persecute Paul in this moment,
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.440]   that every time they doubled down on trying to persecute him, he just became more joyful?
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.120]   Every single time that they were trying to get to him and try to speak to him, throw him in jail,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.520]   beat him up, tell him off, spread false rumors about him, pull rights to the church, he goes,
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   "I'm in chains, but I feel joy overflowing me." There is nothing more annoying to your haters
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.880]   when they're trying to hate on you for you responding with more joy. Try that next time
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.640]   somebody's attacking you online. It's like, "I can do all things if Christ strengthens me. I can have
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.080]   joy no matter what is happening." Paul is trying to unpack this. And we look at this and we think,
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.520]   "This is crazy because I know my life. I know what I've been through. I know what I struggle with,
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:09.040]   and I find joy really hard." How does Paul do it? Well, the answer in that is related to how
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.800]   we understand joy itself. The first thing you need to know is that there is an absolute difference
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:21.040]   in Scripture between joy and happiness. Joy is mentioned 355 times in Scripture.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:28.480]   Happiness is mentioned 26 times. Now, God loves happiness. God's in the happiness, and God likes
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.640]   the fact that we feel happiness, okay? But 355 times, he has something to say about joy. 26 times,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:40.560]   something about happiness. And I think there's an important reason for this. Happiness is an emotion
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.240]   based on circumstances and outcomes. And if circumstances and outcomes go well for you,
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:52.720]   then you're likely to feel an emotion of happiness. The root word for happiness is the word
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.320]   "hap." And "hap" means good luck, fortune, or success. All good things, all things that God
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.160]   would love for us to have, success in life. But here's the reality. We feel happiness because of
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.240]   the happenings in our life. Are you with me? So if things are going well, if stuff is working out,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.960]   if we're enjoying life, and if our circumstances, we're interpreting them in positive ways,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.920]   and the outcomes have gone well, then we will feel this emotive feeling of happiness. So
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:27.360]   happiness is not wrong. But here's the reality. Happiness is fickle. By its very definition,
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.240]   happiness is temperamental. Happiness, in other words, is not always guaranteed
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.720]   because happiness is depending on your circumstances and your outcomes. It's
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.760]   depending on the things that happen to you. In fact, it's dependent on things out of your control.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:48.640]   Because happiness is so fleeting, here's the reality. The enemy has a strategy in this world
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:54.160]   to drive people to the pursuit of happiness because it's an exhausting thing to pursue.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:23:01.200]   Could you imagine if your whole life is based on trying to be happy, trying to enjoy things,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.640]   and those things are so often out of your control? It is incredibly draining to drive in,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:12.560]   to lean into a life of happiness. Ecclesiastes would say this. "If you live life that way,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:19.040]   it's a chasing after the wind." It's a hard thing to grasp. You can't build your life
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.320]   upon your circumstances and your outcomes to be the beauty of your life or the root of your life.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.280]   But so many of us in the world, that's what we're doing. I would argue so many of us in the church,
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:36.400]   that's what we're pursuing. We want happiness when God wants us to experience joy. There are
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:46.320]   different things. Are you with me? Joy, biblically, is the Greek word "kara." And kara means this,
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:57.040]   "to delight overwhelmingly and abundantly within," to be gracious or grateful. Kara literally means
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:03.360]   to have this delight within me. Notice this. This is not talking about some surface kind of emotion.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.960]   It's not talking about something that happens because of what's happening out there. No.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:12.560]   No. Joy in Scripture is a delight that is so deep within me that there is an abundance that flows
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:19.920]   from within that brings this gratitude in me. So when we look at the word itself, we immediately
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.840]   begin to see that joy is something deep within us, and joy is something that has something linked
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:33.040]   to the idea of gratitude, being grateful for stuff. Now, here's the thing. The cognate of
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.640]   kara is the word... By the way, by the way, I know when you woke up this morning, you got out
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.080]   of the shower and you're like, "I hope Andrew unpacks some Greek for me this morning because
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.480]   I'm excited." It's not what you said when you got out of the shower this morning, is it? But bear
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:50.640]   with me, okay? Are you still taking notes? This will blow your mind. Stick with me. The root word
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:59.920]   of kara is kar, and kar means this, extended favor. It's the idea that somebody or something
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.800]   has extended a favor to you, given you something that you did not deserve, that you did not earn,
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.240]   that was not just for you, but they've extended it and given it to you out of a place of gratitude,
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.960]   this graciousness, which is interesting because the Greek word for grace is the word karis.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:28.800]   Follow this. Karis is the idea of God's grace. So kara, joy, and karis, grace, have something to say.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:35.200]   They're both flowing out of the same root word, kar, which means extended favor. So let me pull
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.600]   these threads together and give you a biblical definition of joy. Where happiness is an emotion
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:49.280]   based on circumstances and outcomes, joy is a gratitude rooted in grace, no matter the
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:58.320]   circumstances. Come on, church. Joy is a gratitude rooted in grace, no matter what the circumstances
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:03.200]   are. It's not some surface-level feeling. It's not dependent on some circumstances situation.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.760]   It's not something that's kind of out there. It's something that's found within me, and it's a place
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   of gratitude. Joy is the action of gratitude. There's something that I do. I'm grateful for the
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.680]   grace that's placed inside me. This is why Paul can write in Philippians 4, 4, "Rejoice in the Lord
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:29.120]   always. I'll say it again. Rejoice." Do it always because it is not dependent on circumstance or
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:35.600]   situation. Because for Paul, it's rooted in this idea of grace, and you cannot take the grace from
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:42.480]   me. And if my joy is rooted in grace, then I can know joy no matter what happens to me.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   See, for Paul, grace is rooted in two things. When he thought of grace, he thought of what's called
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:55.840]   present grace and future grace. Let me unpack this real quick. Present grace, for Paul, is the idea
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:02.640]   that I am saved already, that Jesus has gone to the cross, paid the price for my sin. He's died.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:07.520]   He's raised again. I've been imputed righteousness. My relationship with God has been reconciled.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:14.400]   I now know the grace of being in relationship with him. I have a present grace because I'm saved.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:21.040]   Are you with me? There's a future grace, however, the grace that when I die and at the end of all
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:28.160]   things, I will be resurrected into a new body, and I will have eternity seated with Christ Jesus.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:34.640]   For Paul, this is a future grace. I have a grace that's present now because I'm saved. I have a
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.840]   grace in the future because I will be seated. And those two things, the past, the present,
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.600]   and the future, are guaranteed because of the work of Jesus. You can lock them in the bank.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:52.080]   There is nothing that can change it or take it away. Why do I have joy? Because my gratitude
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:58.000]   is in a grace rooted in the present, rooted in the future, and nothing can take the grace away.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:05.200]   Are you with me? So he's thinking this. Lock me in prison for preaching the gospel doesn't
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:13.600]   change the grace. He's thinking to himself, "Beat me up until I pass out doesn't change the grace.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:21.440]   Shipwreck me on a remote island doesn't change the grace. Take a snake and cause it to jump
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.440]   out of the fire and bite me on the hand, and I'll almost die because of poison, but it doesn't
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:31.360]   change the grace. Countless nights where I'm hungry and I can't sleep, it doesn't change the
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:38.640]   grace. A COVID pandemic ravaging the world doesn't change the grace. A political upheaval in a city
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:45.680]   doesn't change the grace. We can know joy in every circumstance and situation. It doesn't
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:53.920]   change the grace." Some of you here today need to take a fresh look at that thing that's
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.480]   overwhelming you right now. That thing you're struggling with right now that's sucking your
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.520]   will to live. I'm not downplaying them or belittling them. We all have them. I have them
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:18.880]   too. I woke up this week feeling incredibly overwhelmed and pressured. Just to the point
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.000]   where I'm like, "I just want to get back into bed and put the covers over me again." Anyone else
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.840]   ever felt like that? Anyone felt like that this week? Anyone feel like that today? I'm glad you're
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:37.280]   here. I'm glad you chose to get out of bed. We all have days like that. You've got things like that,
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.000]   but some of us need to begin to get a spiritual discipline in our lives that when the world tries
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.240]   to overwhelm us, we can stand before it and say, "That doesn't change the grace. I have a Savior
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.640]   who has gone to the cross. I have a God who's going to raise me again, and I know that, and
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:30:00.720]   because I know that, I will have joy regardless of what this world can throw at me." I wonder what
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.160]   it would look like for a church to really believe that in Hong Kong in this hour. That would be
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:13.280]   exciting. This is why Paul does write in Philippians 4 verse 13, "I can do all things through Christ
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.640]   who gives me strength." We like to put this on a bumper sticker. We love to put this on a fridge
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.880]   magnet. We like to preach this, but let me be honest with you. Here's what he's saying. "It's
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:28.000]   not my strength. If it was up to me, I would hate being in prison. If it was up to me, I couldn't
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.080]   handle the snake on my hands. If it was up to me, that shipwreck would have wiped me out, but I'm
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.680]   able to face every trial and circumstance because it's not my strength. His strength is enough for
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:44.080]   me. His resources are enough. His grace I can take to the bank. The fact that Jesus died and rose
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:50.800]   again, I believe it. I know it. It's mine. I root myself in it. I have gratitude for the grace that
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   no one can take away from me. So I didn't enjoy those things. Oh, I wasn't happy because of those
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:07.040]   things, but I was filled with joy." Are you with me, church? Now, where does this joy come from?
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.000]   Well, I'm going to jump now to another of Paul's letters. This is the letter to the church in
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.440]   Galatia. This is found in Galatians chapter 5. I'm going to read a few verses. Is everybody still
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:23.360]   okay? I've got a lot more to go. Are you excited? The exit? No, just kidding. No, no. No good.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.360]   "So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.000]   By the word "flesh" here, he's talking about the sinful nature, our sinful brokenness.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.480]   "For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.320]   flesh. They are in conflict with each other so that you do not know what you want. But if you
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.520]   are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. So the acts of the flesh are obvious to us."
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.560]   You need to listen to him. "Sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft,
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:00.000]   hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, and envy,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.080]   drunkenness, orgies, all that stuff," he's sort of saying. "But I warn you, as I did before,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:09.520]   that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:15.760]   is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:22.400]   Against these things there is no such law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.200]   flesh with its passions and its desires." If you're in this room, if you're watching online
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.480]   right now, and you're a person in Christ Jesus, you have crucified the flesh. In other words,
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.440]   there's a new way that you are now living. And since we now live by the Spirit, let us keep in
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.640]   step with the Spirit. Let us not be conceited, provoking, and envying of each other.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.560]   Ooh, let me break this all down for you. Can I go to my amazing... This is my glass board,
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:55.920]   my amazing glass board. I want to be honest. I borrowed this. Whoa. I knew this would bring joy.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:01.200]   That's why I brought it up. I borrowed it this week from Island ECC, and I want to be grateful,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:07.680]   and thank you them. Yes, way cooler than we are. So here we go. Grateful for Brett. Okay.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.400]   So here's essentially what I think Paul... All right, calm down, calm down, calm down.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.160]   It's not that cool. We had a whiteboard before from China. That was cool.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:29.040]   Thanks, Brett. So here's what Paul's saying. He's saying you've got to understand that in life,
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:35.920]   there's this thing... By the way, these are trees, in case you're wondering what it is
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:44.080]   that I'm drawing. And trees have a root system to them, all these kind of roots that they have.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:53.440]   Okay, stick with me as I quickly draw these amazing roots. And every tree, according to Paul,
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:02.560]   it's going to bear fruit, right? This is fruit, by the way. Okay. It's not the Olympic symbol.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:08.880]   It's fruit. Okay. So stick with me here. He's saying that there is this thing in life where
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:15.040]   we are created this way. Now, Christ Jesus comes. Now, there are two ways that you can produce fruit
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:23.680]   in your life. First of all, if your root is the self, what you'll have in you is this idea of the
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:30.400]   flesh, the sinful nature at work in you. And that will produce some fruit. And I'll just write a few
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:38.080]   of them here. But he talks about jealousy. He talks about rage. He talks about discord, these
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:45.680]   sorts of things. Not good, not healthy. But this will be the fruit when you're rooted in yourself
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:52.080]   and the flesh is working in you. Are you with me? But he said there's another way of living life
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:35:00.400]   where you're rooted in Jesus. And when you're rooted in Jesus, you have the spirit of God alive
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.320]   in you, growing in you. And that spirit has a whole bunch of fruit to it. He speaks of love
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.600]   and patience and kindness and goodness and self-control. But for us today, the most important
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   one, he says, is joy. This is Paul mapping out for them the way in which life takes place. And
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:26.080]   essentially what he's saying is your root will have fruit. Are you with me, church? Your root's
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.680]   going to have some fruit. If your root's in the self, you're going to have the flesh at work in
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.840]   you, producing things like jealousy and all the opposite stuff to joy. But if Jesus is your root,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:43.760]   the spirit of God is in you, and joy will be its fruit. It will come. The inevitability of you
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:49.760]   being in Christ Jesus with the spirit of God in you is that you will know joy. Now this is
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.040]   important because what Paul's essentially saying is joy is not out there somewhere that you kind
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.680]   of need to go out and try to find. We so often think this way. Even us as Christians, we think
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.160]   this way. We think joy is in the next job that we're going to get. We think joy is in a new
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.320]   relationship that's going to happen in our lives. We think joy is kind of out there. And if only if
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:14.480]   I change my job or change my situation or get a bigger bank balance or marry a better person,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:20.400]   I will feel more joy. And what's really important to understand is that joy is not something to be
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.920]   discovered. Joy is something to be developed. Come on, church. It's not something to be
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.520]   discovered just around the corner. It's something to be developed within us. In the same way,
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.200]   what Paul's saying here is joy is not just this idea of some power of positive thinking.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   Joy is not the result of the power of positive thinking. Joy is the result of the power of
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.000]   positive rooting, the thing that you've put in your life. And if you've rooted yourself deeply
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.520]   in Christ Jesus, then the inevitability is that the Spirit will be at work bringing joy. Are you
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:02.400]   following this? Here's why this is really important for you in your life. You do not have a lack of
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:11.360]   joy issue. You do not have a lack of joy issue if you're a Christian in this room. Because Jesus'
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:19.440]   grace is never in doubt, and it is not running out anytime soon. And we know that joy is connected
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:28.240]   to grace and our attitude of gratitude in response to that grace. And what Paul's saying is the fruit
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.480]   of the Spirit is joy. Your problem is not that you have a lack of joy in your life. Here's your
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.560]   problem. Your problem is that the enemy has some strategies that is trying to steal the joy that
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:49.040]   has already been given to you. This is really important. You don't get joy by praying for
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:57.120]   feeling. You get joy by doing the hard work of silencing the things that steal the joy you've
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:04.880]   already been given. You don't lack joy. There's an abundant, overflowing delight inside of you
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:10.400]   because the grace that is present and the grace that is future, nothing changes the grace. There's
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:16.800]   not a problem for you to receive, to develop, to curate more joy. The problem is the enemy is at
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   work trying to steal the joy that is rightfully yours and rightfully given. And the more that we
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:28.000]   understand that, the more I think we can begin to move in the reality of joy. Now, here's the thing.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.280]   I want you to follow this. This will blow your mind. How does the enemy then steal our joy?
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:40.480]   Well, he can't steal your joy outright because a joy is a guaranteed fruit of the Holy Spirit in
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:47.920]   your life. So he can't actually attack the joy. He also cannot attack the grace because the grace
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.640]   is given by Christ, present and future. It's guaranteed through the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.520]   The enemy cannot also take the grace from you. He can't take the joy. He can't take the grace. Are
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.720]   you with me? So what's he going to attack to remove joy from your life? Your attitude of gratitude.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:10.000]   The one thing that he can actually impact is this thing right here. Those people that struggle with
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.760]   the reality of joy are the ones that have a gratitude problem. A bit like me at times.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.320]   Here's the two ways. Is this helping anyone? All right, I'm going to go for another few minutes.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.200]   Is that okay? Hopefully, this will blow your mind too. Here are the two ways the enemy will steal
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:33.840]   your gratitude every single time. The first is through the idea of entitlement. Entitlement
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:41.120]   tells us, "I deserve it." When we think about deserving something, what that actually means is
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.440]   we think that we should get it anyway. When we think that we should get it anyway, we don't have
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.920]   an attitude of gratitude. We don't want to be gracious for what it is that we've received.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.520]   Those of us that think, "Well, I pray hard, so no wonder I get the blessings. I read my Bible
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.880]   every day, so of course God's loving me." When we have this attitude of entitlement, whether in the
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.560]   kingdom of God or in other places in our lives, it diminishes the reality of joy because entitled
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:14.080]   people are not grateful. The second thing is shame. The enemy will also bring shame into your life
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.120]   to cause a disruption to your gratitude. Now, shame is different from entitlement.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:27.040]   Entitlement is, "I deserve it." Shame is, "I could never receive it. I could never receive it because
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.800]   of that thing I did in my past, because of that thing that went on, because of that stuff that
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.400]   somebody did to me. I don't deserve it. I could never receive it. I haven't received it."
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:41.840]   Shamed people, people that are struggling with shame, when that's their root system, it's really hard for
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:47.520]   them to be grateful for things because they basically go, "Well, everybody else received it, but I guess
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.600]   I don't get it. I guess I can't get it. I guess I'm not worthy. I guess I won't get it."
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.680]   They become ungrateful to God because they look around, they think, "God's giving it to
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:02.640]   everybody else and just not giving it to them." Follow this. Entitled people are ungrateful
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   because they think they deserve it. Shameful people are ungrateful because they think they
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.800]   can never receive it. And the enemy will use both of those things, entitlement, pride, arrogance,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:20.320]   shame, hurt, brokenness, to steal your gratitude for joy. Are you with me? All right. In the final
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:25.520]   five minutes I have, I'm going to give you three very practical ways to ensure that gratitude
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.240]   remains in your heart so that you can have joy. Does that sound helpful? All of these are from
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:37.680]   Philippians. Here's the first one. Stoke the fires of gratitude. If you want to have more joy in your
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:45.200]   life, if you want to fight for joy, stoke the fires of gratitude. Let me read this to you from Philippians 1,
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.640]   starting in verse 3 and 4. He says, "I thank God every single time I remember you, for in my prayers
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:57.840]   for all of you, I always pray with joy." Paul starts out, he says, he links thanksgiving and joy together
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.600]   in the same passage. He says, "I'm so thankful for you, and because I have this gratitude in me, I have
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:10.000]   joy within me." So one of the ways that we retain joy and we stoke joy in our lives is by having this
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.920]   practice of gratitude. On Tuesday when I woke up and I felt overwhelmed and I felt slammed and I
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:23.920]   felt beaten down, it was a moment of gratitude that released that pressure from me. Simply realizing
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:30.560]   that no matter what might happen in my workplace, at the vine, with all the pressures that I sometimes
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:38.240]   feel I'm under, no matter what happens, it doesn't change the grace. I have a reason to be joyful.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:45.280]   Jesus once healed 10 lepers. 10 of them in an instant heals them, and they all go off,
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.400]   but only one returns to say thank you. And Jesus goes, "Where did all the other guys go?
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.040]   Weren't all 10 of them healed, but only one of you returned?" Here's what happened that day.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:02.560]   Nine lepers found happiness, but one leper found joy. Stoke the fires of gratitude in your life.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:09.360]   Here's the second thing. Check your roots. Check your roots. Listen to this in Philippians 4 verse 19.
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:16.000]   "And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus." My God
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.400]   will meet your needs. You want to know whether you've got joy in your life? You want to stoke
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:27.520]   joy? Make sure that your needs are rooted in Jesus. Anytime something else takes the place
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:33.680]   for need in your life, you will find a diminished reality of joy. As soon as you put a person
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.360]   where Jesus should be, you will find less joy in your life. Because here's the thing.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.400]   People will let you down. If you're looking for your spouse, if you're looking for your boss,
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:50.800]   if you're looking for your pastor to bring joy into your life, you will not have joy.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:58.160]   Where is it that you're looking for joy? Check your roots. Because if your roots are in Jesus,
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.680]   if he's your place of joy, like Paul, he would say, "You can do anything to me. It doesn't change
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:09.360]   the grace of the reality that I'm thankful that Jesus is at work. Because Jesus will not let me
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.640]   down. You're going to let me down. You're going to let me down. I love you. We're going to let
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:19.520]   each other down. Jesus is never going to let me down." So check your roots. Here's the third and
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:26.800]   final one. Reset your priorities. Philippians 1 verse 18. Here's Paul. He says this. He says,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.440]   "But what does this all matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this, I rejoice." I love this. Paul's just
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.840]   written a whole segment where he's talking about how life is really hard for him, how things are
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.760]   not going well, how people are even out there preaching the gospel with false motives. And then
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.360]   he pauses. It's almost like he's forgotten himself. And he pauses and he goes, "Hang on. What
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.480]   does all of that matter? None of that matters. You know what matters? Jesus is being preached.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:01.360]   And if that's happening, I've got joy." Resetting your priorities. Paul understood that God's
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:07.520]   mission is always greater than his condition. That what God is doing is always greater than
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.600]   what is actually happening to him. You know who else thought that? Jesus. Let me read this to you
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:18.080]   from Hebrews chapter 12, starting in verse 2. "Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:25.520]   of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:32.320]   down at the right hand of the throne of God." There's shame at work. "And for Jesus, for the joy
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:37.360]   set before him." Let me explain what that doesn't mean. It doesn't mean he enjoyed the cross.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:44.640]   In fact, it tells us here he endured it. It wasn't fun for Jesus to get the nails in his hands.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.520]   It wasn't fun for him to wear the crown of thorns. It wasn't fun for him to be insulted. It wasn't
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.840]   fun for him to be whipped. That's not what the scripture is talking about. There was a joy set
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.800]   before him. There was this idea that God's mission is going to be greater than his condition. That if
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.000]   he goes to the cross, if he pays the price for sin, there'll be some people sitting in 29 Burroughs
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.040]   Street back in 2021 who will know joy because of the thing I'm about to do. He set joy before him
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:16.560]   and was willing to take the greatest pain and the greatest destruction on his shoulders. It doesn't
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:24.240]   change the grace. You have joy in every situation. Reset your priorities.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.960]   There was a lady who came up to me once here at the Vine at the end of a service. She came up for
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.560]   prayer and she said, "Pastor Andrew, I just want you to know that I'm so grateful for my cancer."
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   And that took me back a little bit because I was like, "I've never heard anyone say that."
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.480]   I said, "What do you mean? I've never heard anybody say that." And she goes, "Yeah, I get
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:53.200]   that a lot." She said, "I'm so grateful for my cancer because my cancer reminds me of the grace
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:47:00.240]   I have every day that I can still breathe some breath." She said, "I'm so grateful that he's
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.480]   helped me." She said, "You know, when I was healthy, I never ever thought about the grace
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:10.000]   of God in my life. When I was healthy, everything was fine. But since I've gotten cancer and since
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.960]   it's likely that I'll probably die at some point soon, I realized death is just the beginning."
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:22.640]   And it was like she was saying, "I found a new vision for grace in my life and I'm so grateful
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:28.880]   that God has allowed me to breathe this day and to be here with you." And I'm crying in front of her
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:37.440]   because I realize that the enemy has stolen my joy. You need to fight for your joy.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:46.560]   Be thankful. Check your roots. What's the third one? Come on. Reset your priorities.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:52.000]   You do those three things, you'll know joy like never before. Can we pray? Let's pray.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:04.400]   Father, we are so, so grateful. Lord, we thank you that we've seen today an unpacking
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.640]   of how the enemy takes joy from us. We do not have a lack of joy issue.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:17.200]   We're thankful that as we are rooted in you, the Spirit of God at work in us, joy is a beautiful
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:23.360]   fruit. But equally, we're sitting here, Lord, so often struggling with joy.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:28.640]   And we've learned today that we struggle with joy because we struggle with grace.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:36.800]   And we struggle with grace because our gratitude, somewhere along the lines, has fallen away.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:42.640]   Father, I want to pray for anyone in here who realizes
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:49.280]   that they've been carrying a spirit of entitlement, that has been the outworking of the flesh
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:55.840]   and not the Spirit of God. I want you to know if you're carrying a spirit of entitlement this morning,
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:04.960]   God doesn't beat you up. He's not angry. He's not this angry schoolmaster waiting to tell you off.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:15.200]   He's just so overwhelmingly and abundantly delighting in you. And you can change your roots today.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:20.880]   Some of you in this room, it's shame. Somebody's beaten you down.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.960]   Someone has hurt you, said stuff about you, and it's been deeply hard.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:32.640]   Or maybe you've done some things that you're ashamed of.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:37.040]   And because of that, you think you're not worthy of coming before the Lord. You think that you
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.800]   don't deserve it. You think that you're not going to receive it. You think all the blessings are
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.280]   for someone else. And you're a little bit angry about all of that. And you've become ungrateful
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.760]   for grace. If that's you today, there is a place of healing and restoration in the presence of the Lord.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:50:01.120]   Some of you in this room, it's the changing of your roots that's needed today. You've put a person,
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:12.880]   a situation, something out there in place of Jesus. And you're looking to that thing for your joy.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:19.040]   The Lord wants to come and just love on you today and minister to you in that space.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:26.160]   Some of you in this room, you're really struggling. You're really suffering,
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:31.040]   and it's really hard. We know it. Nothing we're saying today takes away the reality
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.400]   that we all go through really difficult things in life. But the beautiful thing is, is that God is
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:44.880]   not desiring for you always to know happiness, but He does want you to have joy. And joy is always
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:52.160]   far greater, far deeper, far longer, far more amazing than happiness. And so if you're in a
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.560]   really difficult place today, I pray that you would know the joy of the Lord is your strength.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:04.560]   The joy of the Lord is your strength. I wonder whether you just stand with me,
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.080]   and I want to just pray over us.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:15.680]   Our time is up, and I'm going to pray in a moment just to release us
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.160]   into the week ahead. But I want you to know there's a prayer team in the upper house and a
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.120]   prayer team here in the lower house. We would love to come around you today and just pray over you.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.680]   I think many of you would love to receive some prayer today. And I want to encourage you not to
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:35.360]   rush out and rush away, but just to take the time that you need with the Holy Spirit in a moment,
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:39.440]   maybe to come forward and just ask someone to pray for you and stand with you
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:46.880]   so that you would know new joy in your life. Father, I pray protection over the church,
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:51.440]   Lord. I thank you so much for each person here. We're so grateful, Lord. And Lord,
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.160]   we come against the enemy's strategies to steal us of joy. Forgive us where we've forgotten
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:02.800]   the abundance of joy that we have through your Spirit as we stay rooted in Christ Jesus.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.960]   Lord, we pray that you would make the Vine a joyful church filled with people that are overwhelmed in
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:13.680]   gratitude for the grace that has been extended to them. Yes, we don't deserve it. Yes, we have
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:19.600]   not earned it. But we are confident that no matter what might take place in our marriages,
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.480]   our workplaces, our situations, our families, and anything that the enemy can throw at us,
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.160]   it doesn't change the grace that has been given to us in Christ Jesus. And because of that, we
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:37.280]   have joy. Lord, I pray you would release us as joyful people into everything that you have for
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.480]   us this week. And we pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
