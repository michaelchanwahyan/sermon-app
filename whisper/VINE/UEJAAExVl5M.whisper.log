[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Hi, good morning everybody. Yes, we are starting a new series of the sermons and
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   definitely will miss up Pastor Tim as he's journey in Germany because usually
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.760]   he's the one that will start the first sermon in the series. So today we're
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.520]   looking at an eight-week series of sermons looking at the books of Acts,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.920]   which is also called the Acts of the Apostles. Acts refers to the actions and
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.560]   deeds of the Apostles after the resurrection of Jesus and the book of
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.360]   Acts serve as a bridge between the gospel and the epistles in the New
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   Testament, providing the context for the letter written by Apostle Paul and other
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:03.680]   Apostles. The book of Acts actually is very crucial for historical, theological, and
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.080]   mission insights, shaping the understanding of the early church and
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   its legacy, and it also provides us the insights into the challenges and the
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.360]   triumphs faced by the Apostles as they preached the gospel and they established
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.200]   the communities of believers at that time. So in this sermon series we will
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.680]   focus on both the external and internal uncharted journey that the Holy Spirit
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:45.040]   is taking us on. The external uncharted journey captures the geographical and
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.340]   cultural expansion of the early church, while the internal journey focus on the
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.440]   spiritual growth and the theological development. Together, through these
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.560]   journeys, the book of Acts is still written today as God continues his work
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.600]   by the Holy Spirit and through his church. This morning we're looking at Acts
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:23.040]   chapter 1 verses 1 to 11. The book of Acts is generally believed to be composed
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:32.240]   by Luke. He's the physician and he also a companion of Apostle Paul. So Acts
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:42.200]   chapter 1, 1 to 5. Let me read it first. "In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.240]   about all that Jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up to
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.520]   heaven. After giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the Apostles he had
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.400]   chosen, after his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.720]   convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of 40
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   days and spoke about the kingdom of God. On one occasion while he was eating with
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.040]   them he gave them this command, 'Do not leave Jerusalem but wait for the gift my
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.560]   father promised which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.200]   but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' The opening verse
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.760]   of Acts here refers to the former book and it reiterates the focus of what Jesus
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.360]   began to do and teach until his ascension. This directly links to two
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.000]   texts showing that Acts is a continuation of the story. So it is
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.240]   actually like one book with two volumes. So volume one is the Gospel of Luke
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.720]   which represents the life of Jesus, the ministry, the miracles, the death, and the
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.680]   resurrection of our Lord. And it lays the foundation for us to understand who Jesus
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.800]   is and his mission in this world. And volume two is the book of Acts which
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.280]   continues this story by focusing on the early church. And Acts does not give us
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.520]   the full history of the church during that time and it spends a period of
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.720]   about 30 years. And both volumes one and volumes two are addressed to a person
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:55.640]   named Theophilus. This name means God's lover or friend of God. Some suggest he
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.120]   may have been a Roman official who's interested in knowing about Jesus and
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.440]   others said he could have represent a group of believers. But anyhow he plays a
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:16.240]   significant role as a recipient. So in verses two to five here Luke recalls his
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:24.200]   previous work where he detailed the life of Jesus. And after Jesus' resurrection he
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.600]   appeared to the apostles over a period of 40 days, providing them with many
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.920]   convincing proof of his resurrection. And during this time Jesus spoke to them
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:46.600]   about the kingdom of God and the coming fulfillment of God's promises. And then
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.480]   in verses six to eleven let me read it to you. Then they gathered around him and
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.000]   asked him, "Lord are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.840]   He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.760]   set by his own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.400]   on you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.760]   to the ends of the earth." And after he said this he was taking up before their
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.960]   very eyes and a cloud hid him from their sights. They were looking intently up
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.200]   into the sky as he was going when suddenly two men dressed in white stood
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   beside them. And they said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into the
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:53.520]   sky? This same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven and will come back
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.640]   in the same way you have seen him go into heaven." So when 40 days of
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.680]   appearance and the conversation with Jesus, these apostles were beyond doubt.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:13.240]   They are ready to go and they have many sound proofs and they want to ask and
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.120]   they want to know and they ask Jesus if the time has come for Jesus
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:26.720]   to restore the kingdom to Israel. And you probably wonder why the apostles will
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:35.160]   ask such question. And actually this question reflects the Jewish expectation
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:42.120]   and the hopes concerning the Messiah. And of course it also highlights a common
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:49.680]   misconception of the people about the nature of Jesus' mission. The Jewish
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.960]   people anticipate a Messiah who will deliver them from foreign oppression. And
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:03.360]   at that time Israel was under the Roman occupation and they longed for political
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:12.120]   freedom and independence. So the apostles likely saw Jesus, he is the one who can
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:19.000]   do that for them. And of course Jesus surely recognized their confusion and
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.720]   the expectation of Messiah. Instead of correcting them for this question, Jesus
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.520]   used this moment to teach them a lesson about the nature of his mission. He
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:40.240]   redirect their focus from earthly expectation to a larger spiritual
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:47.360]   mandate, putting their focus toward the spiritual empowerment of the Holy Spirit
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:54.560]   and the global mission. They will receive power when the Holy Spirit came upon
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:02.360]   them, enabling them to be his witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria and to
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:11.000]   the ends of the earth. Jesus simply told them that the times and seasons were not
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.920]   their concern. Their responsibility was to be faithful to him and work
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.960]   while they were waiting. And Jesus was in the process of revealing a deeper truth
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:33.240]   about his kingdom. You see God's kingdom is inclusive. It containing diverse
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:40.640]   nations and communities. He knew that the apostles will grow into future roles of
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.320]   leaders of the church and also they will grow in understanding as they experience
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.720]   the Holy Spirit's empowerment and the unfolding events of the early church.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:01.800]   However, the apostles were looking for the kingdom at that time and they wanted
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.560]   to know now. They didn't realize the kingdom that Jesus was talking about,
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:17.640]   Jesus was bringing this kingdom, would come later and only after a long battle
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:27.800]   of suffering and tears. After this, in Acts chapter 1 verses 10 to 11, Jesus is
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:36.200]   taking up into heaven, disappearing from their sights. As the apostles stood there
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:44.880]   and gazing up into the sky, two men, very likely they are angels, dressed in white
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:51.920]   and suddenly appear in front of them. And these two men asked him, "Why you're
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:59.960]   standing here and looking to the sky? This Jesus that you are looking at and
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:10.040]   living up into the heaven and he will come back." And apparently witnessing
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:19.000]   Jesus ascending into the sky was a profound and unexpected event. The
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.480]   apostles gazed into the sky, mirrored their astonishment and a sense of loss.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:35.080]   And they suddenly realized they would no longer have Jesus physically with them.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:42.480]   It very likely brought a feeling of sadness to them. But at the same time,
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.520]   despite their sorrow, there was also a sense of hope tied to Jesus' promises
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:57.040]   about the Holy Spirit and the continuation of his work through them. So
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:04.240]   the ascension is not just a departure. It represents the beginning of a new
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:16.840]   chapter in God's divine plan. And Jesus is coming back. In Luke chapter 17, Jesus
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:25.520]   compared his second coming to the days of Noah. This analogy emphasized the
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:33.160]   unexpected nature of his return and the need for the people to be vigilant and
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:41.720]   prepared. What happened in Noah's time? In Noah's time, people's life focused on
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:50.400]   earthly matters. They were engaged in their daily routines. Eating, drinking,
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:59.240]   marrying, and living a life as usual and unaware of the impending flood. Jesus
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:07.480]   urged his believers to be alert and watchful as his return will come
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:15.040]   unexpectedly, much like the flood that came suddenly upon in Noah's time. This
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:22.160]   highlights the importance of being spiritually prepared at all times. We
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:29.600]   need to live a life of faith and readiness, actively seeking to align with
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:38.760]   God's will, rather than being complacent or distracted by the earthly matters.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:46.960]   Unfortunately, how many believers are really prepared for Jesus' return?
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:57.200]   Likewise, as we gaze at the sky, we must ask ourselves, are we just spectators or
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:09.000]   are we ready to act? It's time to turn into action. We all have a call to serve,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.840]   to share the Gospels, to show kindness, to spread the love of Jesus in our
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:24.400]   communities and in this world. Instead of waiting to change, let's be the change we
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:32.160]   want to see. It is our actions and our deeds on the ground that will
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.880]   truly reflect the light of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:45.240]   So after Jesus went to heaven, the apostles returned to Jerusalem filled
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:52.440]   with a renewed sense of purpose. They knew they need something more. They needed
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:59.720]   to wait for the Holy Spirit to come upon them, to give them the power to build a
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:06.520]   new kingdom. So they gathered together in prayer and prepared for the coming of the
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:15.760]   Holy Spirit. They did what Jesus told them to do and there's nothing supernatural
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.520]   about going back to Jerusalem or gathering for prayers. But they pray as
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:32.560]   they wait. They took the step in front of them. They know how to take and trusting
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:40.440]   Jesus will do what he said he would do at his time. And the waiting is not
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:50.480]   passive. It is an active faith. Church, do you see the apostles? How had gone
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:57.280]   through such a dramatic change between the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts?
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:07.760]   In volume 1, the disciples were called by Jesus a few times, "Oh you of little faith,"
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.680]   in response to their doubts. They were actually cowards, heeding in fear of
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:23.280]   their lives. But in volume 2, something dramatic transformation has happened in
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:30.160]   their lives. The coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost marked a turning point.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.480]   They realized that their mission would not be carried out by their own strength,
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:45.760]   but through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. They waited for the Holy Spirit,
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:54.200]   which Jesus said the Father had promised to send as a gift. This waiting period is
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:01.720]   crucial as it prepared them for their future mission. They waited and they
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:09.640]   waited, never asked how long. And they actually, they did not know how long it
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:16.840]   took. And finally, the coming and the feeling of the Holy Spirit empowered
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:26.240]   them. That explained a great measure of transformation of these men and their
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:34.160]   life. They were not only bold, they are downright courageous and they are ready
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:42.560]   to hold back nothing but to preach the gospel and to live a life for Jesus.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:53.640]   I wonder today, how many of you are waiting for something in your life?
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.720]   Perhaps you're waiting for a better job, waiting for someone to meet, to get
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:08.600]   married, to start a family, waiting for healing of a sickness, or waiting for the
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:17.440]   salvation of your family members, or even you're going through a trial and you're
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:24.960]   waiting for it to come to pass. Or are you standing at the edge of an uncharted
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:33.680]   journey, feeling fearful about taking that very first step? I probably can list
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:41.480]   many more things and still may not be what you're waiting for. But nevertheless,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:50.380]   we're all waiting for something, right? And in fact, much of our life is waiting.
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:19:00.580]   Believe it or not. And waiting is no fun. And many times, waiting is very difficult.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:09.440]   But our lives are full and filled with waiting. We may not be waiting for the
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:17.640]   exact same thing as apostles. But as a believer, please don't allow frustration
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:26.720]   of waiting to diminish our faith. We are to wait upon the promises of God.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:33.480]   Like the apostles, we may not fully understand how God's promises to us will
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:43.720]   be fulfilled. But we simply need to wait. But remember, every great adventure
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:53.880]   begins with uncertainty. And God is with you every step of the way. And with faith,
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:02.680]   each step will lead you closer to his purpose. Lean on his promises and take
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:10.480]   that move with courage, knowing that he will guide you and will fill your path
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:18.360]   with amazing possibilities. And throughout the scriptures, we see that God never
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:30.240]   fails to do what he has promised. And in every single case, God has proven faithful.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:38.160]   And in my personal journey, constantly, it is full of waiting. And I would like to
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:45.760]   share with you the most current ones. About two and a half years ago,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:55.360]   I left my pastor position with another church, which I have engaged for 13 years.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:05.840]   The law simply told me to be still and wait. And honestly, I have no idea what
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:16.480]   I was waiting. And honestly, I'm still waiting. For what? I don't know.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:25.280]   But only two things I knew. One is to stay in this church to be a volunteer.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:32.080]   Two, I knew very well about myself. If I didn't have a traditional paid job
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:39.720]   with income, I would very likely become consumed by anxiety over how to cover my
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:49.480]   rent and everyday expenses. And needless to say, I spent many months
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:58.280]   battling with anxiety and the fear of lack, the fear of not having enough.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:07.560]   And then one day, God finally broke his silence and he revealed to me two ways he
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:16.760]   will provide me. He used a tube of toothpaste as a metaphor.
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:25.480]   So sometimes he will squeeze out just the right amount. If I need $10,000 for rent,
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.880]   he will provide precisely that. And then when I need $400 for groceries,
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:40.720]   he would deliver exactly that. Honestly, this method often feels like a
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:49.640]   struggle and it can be very frustrating and very annoying. I don't know if you
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:59.760]   can imagine that. It's very annoying. And I have to learn to let go of my control
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:09.080]   and learn to trust in it. And then in other times, he will hand me the tube of
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:17.520]   toothpaste, allowing me to squeeze out wherever I want or I need. And then when
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:27.000]   that tube is empty, he may give me another one for me to manage by myself or he may
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.240]   keep that tube. And again, he will provide just enough for my daily needs.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:47.800]   And I have no idea who, when, and how he provides. And I have experienced at least
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:56.920]   three times I went overseas with my children and God only provide airfares
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:08.240]   and lodging. And we have no spending money before we left Hong Kong. And we have to
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:21.080]   live by faith. And upon the arrival of the destination, somehow this amazing God
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:32.040]   somehow will provide for our needs from unexpected source. Living by faith
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:39.360]   financially has been a part of my Christian journey for many years. And I'm
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:47.000]   sure many missionaries can relate to what I'm saying. But to be honest, it's not
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:57.160]   something I have always embraced very well. However, I finally began to
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:06.960]   understand by surrendering to Jesus and submitting to his way and his time.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:14.840]   Amidst all the ups and downs of uncertain and uncharted waiting, one
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:27.360]   thing remains very clear. He never fails me. He always carry me through on time.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:38.160]   He never late. He always provides and he keep his promise. And I am very well
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:47.720]   taken care of by my father God. And sometimes I think I really don't deserve
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:57.760]   it. And through this constant waiting upon the law and embracing the unknown,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   there have been many opportunities for me to grow in a deeper and more trusting
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:15.320]   relationship and connection with him. Each day through prayer, worship, and
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:23.760]   surrender, I finally found peace, experienced his glory, and learned to
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:32.600]   depend on him more and more and hopefully one day will be completely.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:45.640]   His timing is perfect. And by submitting my own desire, my control, and my timeline
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:55.480]   to him, I release my anxieties and open myself to the blessings he has in store.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:04.840]   This journey has taught me that patience and faith go hand in hand. And in moments
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:17.760]   of uncertainty, he is my unwavering source of strength and guidance. Church, I
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:26.160]   may not know what you are going through, but in the darkest moments when you are
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:36.240]   crying out to God and you don't want to tell anybody, when hope seems so distant
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:48.760]   and the wait seems so long and endless, remember his promise. God will never
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:58.640]   abandon you. He will never leave you or forsake you. His promises are for all his
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:08.360]   children, given by God as our loving Father. The promises of God is the
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:15.840]   promises of our Father. It is always for our good.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:28.040]   May we have a moment of silence and less wait for our God.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:53.520]   As you are praying, there's two things I would like to tell you. Those who place
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:02.600]   their trust in the Lord will witness his faithfulness. You see, God's timing is
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:12.920]   perfect because it reflects his divine perspective, allowing him to prepare us
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:24.880]   and align events with his greater purpose. While waiting can be challenging,
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:38.800]   but it will lead to personal growth. When we learn to wait on him, we will develop
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:47.640]   our character, faith, wisdom, and strength.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:57.320]   The apostles gave us an example to this by not rushing ahead. Instead, they trusted
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:05.080]   in God and received his power at the right moment.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:12.120]   Do you want to receive that power?
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:21.520]   [Music]
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:35.360]   God's delays are not denials. His promises will be fulfilled. Let patience
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:44.880]   and boldness prepare us to embrace the fullness of his promises.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:55.120]   The second thing
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:06.880]   God wants to tell you today, through the scriptures, he urged us to take action
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:19.720]   while we wait for him to do what only he can do. And he will act, he will speak, and
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:30.160]   provide exactly what we need to be his instruments of power in this world.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.480]   Do you want to be that instrument?
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:46.760]   [Music]
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:58.040]   Each of us plays an important role in this unfolding story until Jesus returns.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:08.320]   Empowered by the Holy Spirit, we are actively writing the final chapters, and
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:17.560]   it is our responsibility to remain focused and diligent in fulfilling our
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:31.360]   divine calling. So let us navigate life's uncertainties with hope and confidence,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:41.600]   and let us rise to occasion and engage fully in our mission.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:59.480]   And I will give you a moment of silence that you can pray to God and to answer
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:05.880]   his questions that he's asking you.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:18.480]   Do you want to be filled by his power? Do you want to be the instrument of this
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.920]   power?
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:30.920]   [Music]
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   [Music]
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   [Music]
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:34:00.920]   [Music]
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   [Music]
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   So let us pray.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   Our heavenly Father, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   We come before you with hearts open to your promises. We humble ourselves in
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:53.400]   front of you, Lord. Just as the disciples waited in faith for the Holy Spirit, help
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:05.360]   us to embrace our own seasons of waiting, moment by moment, step by step. Teach us,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:14.920]   Lord, to trust in your perfect timing and to find peace in the unknown.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:27.120]   Our precious Lord, remind us that waiting is not a sign of inactivity, but it is an
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:35.080]   opportunity for growth and deeper connection with you. Lord, fill us with
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:44.840]   your Spirit, guiding us as we seek to understand your will for our lives. And
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:52.760]   we surrender our worries and uncertainties. Instill in us a steadfast
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:58.280]   faith that believes in your goodness.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:11.320]   Oh God, have mercy on us. Help us to let go of our control. Help us to find
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:20.560]   strength in prayer and worship, knowing that you are always with us and help us
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:30.840]   to encourage and support one another in our waiting to trust in your divine plan.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:39.880]   Lord Jesus, let us be filled with hope, knowing that you are the amazing God
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:50.800]   that you are at work, even though we cannot see and we don't understand. We
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:56.960]   thank you for your faithfulness and for the gift of your presence. In Jesus'
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:06.480]   mighty name we pray, amen. Church, may we stand and let us worship.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:15.040]   You call me out.
