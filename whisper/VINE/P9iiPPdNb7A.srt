1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
 When I was, actually, can we pull up the football slide?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,000
 I do want to talk about that a little bit.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Sorry, that was too exciting.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,080
 Okay, so here you see the, easy, you see the Vinylon team.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,120
 We had an incredible football tournament this past Friday.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,280
 I want to say thank you for those of you who came out to support us.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,560
 Also thank you for those who helped us raise funds for Branches of Hope.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,240
 So we were able to reach 7,000 Hong Kong lives for Branches of Hope.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,480
 So we're excited about that.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,540
 And then, to our own surprise, we actually did quite well.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,320
 So we won the first three games.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
 We made it into the playoffs.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,280
 And we ended up losing in the quarterfinal in the penalty shootouts.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,600
 It was very dramatic.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 That's how we liked it.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
 So it was good.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,920
 So thank you so much.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,120
 And yeah, thanks for pulling that up.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,080
 But today, it's a one-off message.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,760
 Next week we'll also have a one-off message.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,600
 I just want to share something that was on my heart for you.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,240
 Now when I was a university, or just a young graduate, I had just graduated from university,

23
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,800
 and it seemed like that the people around me, that things were coming together in their

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,340
 lives.

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,840
 That stuff was working out for them.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,440
 That their careers were working out.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,040
 Their relationships were working out.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,280
 And here there was me, and I was still trying to find my way, my career path.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,960
 I was trying to, I was wondering, you know, is there somebody that I will, that there's

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,760
 a significant other that I'm going to be able to get to spend my life with.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,040
 And during that time, a lot of my friends got married.

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,800
 In the US, people marry young.

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,080
 They had very promising jobs.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,720
 And so as I was doing this comparison thing, I just really was wondering, you know, am

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,400
 I ever going to be content?

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,520
 Because I was feeling some discontent in my heart.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
 Am I going to be okay?

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,760
 Am I going to make it?

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,960
 And there was some anxiety actually around my future.

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:25,760
 Now I think we all have experienced this, where we long to experience content in our

41
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,080
 heart, where we just feel at peace with where we are and what's happening.

42
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,600
 But the reality is, that's actually not easy to come by, is it?

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,320
 To feel content.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,920
 That's something, I feel like it's like, you know, you almost have it, and then it slips

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,080
 through your hands.

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,000
 Or feeling content is just something that seems like I'm almost there.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,360
 It's just around the corner.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,520
 If just this one thing happens, then I'm going to feel content.

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
 My life is going to be amazing.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,480
 You know, everything's going to be good.

51
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,320
 But it always just seems a little bit out of reach for most of us.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:15,600
 And then there are seasons where we do feel content, and then our circumstances change,

53
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,360
 and all of that goes out the window.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,360
 What do we do then?

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,800
 How should we think about this?

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,680
 Well, what I want to explore with you today through this message, and this word that God

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,160
 has put on my heart, is I want to explore with you this question.

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,760
 How can I grow and learn to be content in all circumstances?

59
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,400
 And is that even something that is possible, or is that just wishful thinking?

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
 Does that sound good?

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
 Yes.

62
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 A little bit.

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 Yes.

64
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
 Okay.

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
 Good, good.

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,840
 Just making sure, you know, it's not two people are excited about this.

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,840
 There's a few more.

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
 That's good.

69
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,240
 So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the book of Philippians, which is one

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,000
 of the letters that Paul wrote.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,640
 And in Philippians, one of the reasons why he wrote the letter, actually, I was reading

72
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,840
 one of those introductory New Testament books, there's seven reasons for why Paul wrote the

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,960
 letter of Philippians, but I want to share with you one that is significant for our context,

74
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,200
 for what we're going to look at, and that is Paul is writing this letter to say thank

75
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,080
 you for a financial gift that the Philippians have made to him while he is in prison in

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
 Rome.

77
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,000
 So Paul is writing this letter from prison in Rome, and he's saying thank you.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,640
 Now what makes this more significant is that Paul and the Philippians, they have a very

79
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,200
 close relationship.

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,400
 He planted the church in Philippi.

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
 They have been supporting him.

82
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:59,200
 They've been partners with him in ministry and have supported him financially all along.

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,280
 But another thing is that they didn't give out of their abundance.

84
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:14,400
 Actually, in second Corinthians, we learned that the Philippians were facing severe trials

85
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,780
 and that they were living in extreme poverty.

86
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,940
 So their generosity flows out of a place of extreme poverty.

87
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,700
 It's out of the place that they're giving and loving on Paul in his circumstances.

88
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,800
 And so Paul is saying thank you.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,880
 And so this is where we pick up in Philippians four, starting in verse 10, it says this.

90
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,220
 I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me.

91
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,500
 Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.

92
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,240
 I'm not saying this because I'm in need, for I've learned to be content whatever the circumstances.

93
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,320
 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.

94
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:10,360
 I've learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed

95
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,160
 or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.

96
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,640
 I can do all this through him who gives me strength.

97
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:28,780
 Now in verse 10, we see that Paul, he rejoices that this concern for him has been renewed.

98
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:36,760
 And he also acknowledges that they, for whatever reason, for a season, didn't have the opportunity

99
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,320
 to express their loving concern for Paul.

100
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,320
 Now maybe it was their own difficult circumstances, maybe it was even Paul's circumstances, because

101
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 I mean he's in prison, Philippi and Rome, they're like 800 kilometers or something like

102
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,080
 that apart.

103
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,600
 Back then there was no text messaging, so it's hard to keep up with what's going on

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,020
 in each other's lives.

105
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,440
 But at last they have renewed their concern and Paul is just grateful and he says thank

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
 you.

107
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:11,000
 But then he turns things around and he wants to actually encourage them through his own

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,840
 example.

109
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,560
 And so that's what verse 11 and 13 is all about.

110
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,880
 And this is what I want to focus on with us, is how Paul wants to encourage the Philippians

111
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,320
 who are facing struggles, who are facing challenges, and he wants to speak into their lives.

112
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,040
 Now as I was praying over what to share, I had a million thoughts, a million ideas, but

113
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,560
 I just felt that we're one year into our church plant, or a public launch at least, we've

114
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,600
 been doing this longer.

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,560
 There's a lot of things, I know there's a lot of things going on in your lives, and

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,160
 I just felt that God wants to encourage us and give us confidence in who he is so that

117
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:02,400
 we can learn to be content and know him, know his power in all circumstances of our lives.

118
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:10,680
 So that was my sense for the day and so that's what I want to share with you.

119
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,200
 So let me take you to verse 11 and 12.

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,380
 It says, "I'm not saying this because I'm in need, for I've learned to be content whatever

121
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,320
 the circumstances.

122
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,880
 I know what it is to be in need and I know what it is to have plenty.

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,320
 I've learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,520
 or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want."

125
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:40,460
 So Paul is saying, "Hey, I'm grateful for your gift.

126
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,360
 Thank you so much."

127
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,600
 But then he says, and this is super interesting, "But your gift is not what guarantees me being

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,940
 content.

129
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,160
 My external circumstances, they don't determine whether or not I feel content."

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,360
 Now this is actually mind blowing, right?

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,480
 He's in prison.

132
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,400
 Now in prison back in the days, it wasn't that the government was collecting money and

133
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,320
 then uses money to feed prisoners.

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,000
 Prisoners depended on family members and friends to actually bring needed resources to the

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 prison.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,920
 If you had nobody bringing you anything, that was it.

137
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:28,320
 And so, but Paul is saying, "My wellbeing does not depend on gifts like this.

138
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,680
 It depends on something else."

139
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,520
 And he also, he was not somebody who was living this luxurious life where everything was working

140
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
 out perfectly.

141
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
 He didn't have any challenges.

142
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,280
 I mean, he's in prison.

143
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,920
 He had people, churches that he loved turn on him.

144
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,840
 We saw him as his enemies.

145
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,160
 He was beaten several times almost to death.

146
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,960
 So I mean, this guy, for him to say that is very significant.

147
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,440
 These are not just like easily spoken words from somebody who's like comfortable sitting

148
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,400
 somewhere on a nice sofa having a drink.

149
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:16,880
 Now let's continue to, actually before I go any further, let me define what we mean by

150
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 content.

151
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,800
 And I want to give a Christian definition of this.

152
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:28,000
 So here's a definition, says this, "Contentment describes finding peace, joy, and satisfaction

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,960
 regardless of life circumstances."

154
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,480
 So Paul is making this incredible claim that regardless of what happens outside of him,

155
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:49,120
 he can know the joy, the satisfaction, and the contentment in the Lord, the peace that

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,840
 surpasses all understanding.

157
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,080
 This is absolutely incredible.

158
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,960
 But of course we wonder, is this really true?

159
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,280
 You know, is this something that we can actually really experience and know?

160
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,040
 So let's continue to unpack this.

161
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,640
 So in verse 12, Paul says, "I have learned the secret of being content."

162
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,520
 Now this is very interesting.

163
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:20,280
 It has the word learned and it has the word secret.

164
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,920
 Now why would Paul use these two words, that he learned and it's a secret?

165
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,880
 Well, I believe that it points us towards this learning to be content or being content

166
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,720
 is not something that is just easily come by.

167
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,840
 There has been some lessons, life lessons along the way that have brought Paul to this

168
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,400
 point.

169
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:49,000
 But you also use the word secret because not everyone knows how to experience this contentment.

170
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,560
 Just think of like books.

171
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,120
 I actually did some Amazon search about some book titles that uses the word the secret.

172
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,640
 So the secret of lasting beauty.

173
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,440
 You know, ooh, I want to know that.

174
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,400
 I'm getting older, you know.

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,480
 The secret of a successful marriage.

176
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,880
 That's a good one.

177
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,360
 The secret of winning at life.

178
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,480
 Why do these books exist?

179
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,520
 Because we're looking for the code, right?

180
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,520
 We want to find the answer to these questions or something that's just not easily available.

181
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,640
 We want to know the answer because we want to experience the good marriage, the lasting

182
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,680
 beauty, the good life.

183
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,680
 And so we buy these books, attend these workshops, you know, do all these things.

184
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:48,680
 But Paul is using this to just say this experience of contentment, you know, it's not something

185
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,040
 that is easily come by and actually eludes or is not easily available or obvious to everyone

186
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,980
 how to experience that.

187
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,280
 And people actually really struggle with that.

188
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,160
 Now I want to be clear, he's not saying actually through his passage, he tells us how we can

189
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,440
 learn to be content or how we find contentment.

190
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,520
 So he's actually, it's an open secret in what he's writing.

191
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:17,160
 But he's using this language to show us, you know, that it's actually something that doesn't

192
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,080
 come easy our way.

193
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,640
 So the first thing is that real contentment is a secret.

194
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,080
 But just because it's hard for us to be content, it does not stop us from trying, does it?

195
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:40,160
 We often believe that the desire for contentment will be satisfied by accomplishments, material

196
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:49,040
 possessions, relationships, and the approval of others.

197
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,360
 We say to ourselves, "Hey, you say it's a secret.

198
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,720
 Hey, I know the secret.

199
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,840
 I know the answer to what will make me content.

200
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,040
 If only I have this relationship, if only I get married, if only I have this house,

201
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,720
 if only I can stay in this job a little bit longer and I get that promotion, if only I

202
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,380
 get the approval from my father that I've been working so hard for."

203
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:22,080
 And I just wonder, I'm just thinking about ourselves, what have you been telling yourself

204
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,320
 that will give you contentment?

205
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:32,960
 You know, what are you thinking in these material things or other achievements that will provide

206
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,920
 contentment for you?

207
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
 Is it that relationship?

208
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,200
 Is it that promotion?

209
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,040
 Is it a designer bag?

210
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,360
 Something that I don't care about at all?

211
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:57,600
 You know what, what is it?

212
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,520
 And so we say to ourselves, "I know what will make me happy.

213
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,960
 I know what will make me content.

214
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,320
 I know what I'm after.

215
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,040
 That thing, this will bring me contentment."

216
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,960
 And we believe that the objects that are stirring the desire within us will also be the objects

217
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,440
 that will bring the contentment.

218
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,980
 Let me give you an example.

219
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:29,840
 When I was younger, living in Germany, Nike or Nike, you know, some people call it Nike,

220
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,680
 shoes were expensive.

221
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,560
 And they were really something special.

222
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
 Not everyone had those, but some of my friends had them.

223
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,560
 They played basketball.

224
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,160
 And I really wanted a pair of Nikes, some Nike shoes.

225
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,920
 And I thought if I have them, you know, it's going to feel great.

226
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,320
 I'm going to be a better basketball player.

227
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,880
 And I'm going to be a little bit cooler.

228
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,680
 And so there was the object that stirred this desire in my heart.

229
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,280
 And I thought that somehow these shoes will make me feel better.

230
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,240
 And they did.

231
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,960
 But just for a little while, right?

232
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,160
 Just for a little while.

233
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,440
 And then I thought, "Oh, it's not the shoes.

234
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,600
 It's this other thing."

235
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,320
 And so the question is, you know, is that really true about these things that we say

236
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,640
 will bring us contentment?

237
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,520
 Is it really true?

238
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:30,800
 The things that you're looking for, that you think will make you all right, are those really

239
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,040
 the things that make us all right?

240
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,280
 Now I did get those shoes.

241
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,680
 And I think some of us have reached some of our goals, achieved perhaps some of our dreams

242
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,320
 along the way.

243
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,760
 And it does feel good.

244
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,780
 There's no denying of that.

245
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:56,240
 But then what happens is we reach this goal, and then we turn around, and we say, "You

246
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
 know what?

247
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,400
 It wasn't this thing, but it's this other thing that will make me content."

248
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:11,040
 And then we focus our energy on this other thing that we don't have yet.

249
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,520
 So being content is like, you know, I'm trying to reach for this thing, but I struggle to

250
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,280
 ever really arrive.

251
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,840
 I'm just not getting there.

252
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,940
 It's just always around the corner.

253
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:29,440
 It slips through my hands.

254
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:37,880
 But yet, you know, I'm feeling this longing to just be whole, to be at peace about all

255
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,340
 the things that are going on in my life.

256
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,080
 And so we seek to find contentment in things.

257
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,120
 Now in verse 12, Paul shows us what true contentment looks like.

258
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,920
 It means being content in all of life's circumstances.

259
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,800
 So there's a true contentment, there's a false contentment.

260
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,920
 True contentment means, you know, whatever happens, it doesn't matter.

261
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:12,880
 I can know peace, I can know joy, I can know satisfaction, regardless of what happens.

262
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,600
 But a false contentment is exposed, and Paul talks about plenty and want.

263
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 When we experience plenty and want, that sort of shows of the contentment that we're experiencing

264
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
 if it's the real deal.

265
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:36,400
 Or if something happens and whatever circumstances change, are we really going to be content?

266
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,240
 So the way you can tell you have real contentment is if you can handle plenty and want.

267
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
 But there is actually a problem with that.

268
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,000
 Because a lot of times, well, some of us never experience want.

269
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,920
 Like we've always in our lives actually had a certain level of things and cares.

270
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,140
 We never hit really the point where we're just struggling for existence.

271
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,000
 But some of us have experienced that.

272
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,320
 You know, we know want.

273
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,520
 And we've just hit rock bottom, or we're in a very difficult place.

274
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,080
 But I believe that most of us have not experienced plenty.

275
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,160
 Where really in a very major substantial way, our dreams come actually true.

276
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,040
 Where we get the influence, the power, the finances, the whatever it is that you dream

277
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:41,440
 of, that you just have that in such a crazy abundance, that you actually find out, even

278
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,400
 if I have all these things, they still don't make me content.

279
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
 Now, Jim Carrey, some of you know him.

280
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,740
 By now it's a little bit maybe for older generation already.

281
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,320
 So he was or is a Canadian actor, comedian.

282
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,960
 Back in the '90s, 2000s, was movies.

283
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,220
 I don't know if he still does movies or not.

284
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
 But he said this.

285
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,320
 So somebody who has reached plenty, he says this.

286
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,200
 I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so

287
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,720
 they can see that it's not the answer.

288
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,120
 Even if you reach this point, it actually does not make you content.

289
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,720
 But most of us never get there.

290
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,880
 And so the problem is maybe we taste a little bit of it.

291
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,720
 And so we actually still believe that those things will make us content.

292
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,760
 Because we just experience a little bit of the dream.

293
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,640
 And we're like, if I just manage to do a little bit more, then I'm going to be content.

294
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:53,480
 And so we actually buy into this lie.

295
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,640
 But what if we actually do experience plenty and want?

296
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
 What are some of the responses?

297
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,960
 Well, there's three -- I want to suggest three ways that people respond to it.

298
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,680
 The first one is they reach their dream.

299
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,800
 It is fulfilled.

300
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,520
 It's amazing.

301
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,240
 But then after a little while, it wears off.

302
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
 And they're like, you know what?

303
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,720
 Actually, this was not my dream.

304
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,840
 This thing here is my dream.

305
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,680
 You know, that relationship, that didn't make me happy.

306
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,520
 This other relationship is going to really make me happy.

307
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,840
 And so then they shift it.

308
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,520
 They're like, oh, I was wrong about this.

309
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,200
 But I know I'm right about this.

310
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,440
 So that's one response.

311
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,760
 Another one is that actually we grow cynical.

312
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,680
 Like where you reach this -- you know, your dream, and you're like, you know, I've tried

313
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:47,280
 so hard to be content, but I'm -- I feel like the universe is messing with me.

314
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,400
 Because even if I have all these things, I just don't feel good.

315
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,760
 I think this world is just a joke.

316
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,560
 And so this is actually a very dark place to be in; right?

317
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,040
 A very cynical place.

318
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,000
 So that's a conclusion that people draw.

319
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
 But then there's a third thing.

320
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,960
 And that's, of course, what I want to suggest to you.

321
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:11,640
 Is that actually this longing for being content and looking for it in things, that it actually

322
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:18,200
 is something that points us towards God.

323
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:25,160
 You know, that there is something in this universe that can fulfill these deep longings.

324
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:33,280
 And that we can find that in a personal relationship with Jesus.

325
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,880
 And so this is actually a story of C.S. Lewis.

326
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,840
 C.S. Lewis, he was an English professor at Oxford and Cambridge University.

327
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,840
 He writes about his journey of coming to faith in the book "Surprised by Joy."

328
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,300
 And it's actually his longing.

329
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,160
 He calls it "Sehnsucht," which is German, which makes me happy.

330
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,680
 You know, this longing that he felt was actually what brought him on his journey of finding

331
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,660
 faith.

332
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,360
 That there must be something else.

333
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,480
 And so he wrote in "Mere Christianity," one of his most well-known books, he wrote this

334
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 quote.

335
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,200
 And he's talking about that because we have this longing, it is something that points

336
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 us to God.

337
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
 So let me read this to you.

338
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,080
 "Creatures are not born with desires unless satisfaction for those desires exists.

339
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,160
 A baby feels hunger, well, there's such a thing as food.

340
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,240
 A duckling wants to swim, well, there's such a thing as water.

341
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,520
 Men feel sexual desire, well, there's such a thing as sex.

342
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:52,560
 If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable

343
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,480
 explanation is that I was made for another world.

344
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,440
 If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a

345
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
 fraud."

346
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,480
 So in other words, it does not prove the cynical view.

347
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,040
 All the earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest

348
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,080
 the real thing.

349
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,760
 So in other words, our longing and desire for being content, they point us to God.

350
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,600
 You know, that there is someone out there who can fulfill this deep longing and desire

351
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,800
 in our hearts, and who can meet that, that it doesn't matter what the circumstances are,

352
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,440
 we can find wholeness, we can find peace, we can find strength, we can find joy, we

353
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,040
 can find satisfaction, you know, in him.

354
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:49,880
 And this is actually also where Paul is moving in the letter to Philippians in verse 13.

355
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:59,440
 So he says this, he says, "I can do all of this through him who gives me strength."

356
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,840
 So out of this relationship with Jesus, he can face plenty and want, because it's Jesus

357
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,200
 who gives him the power and the strength to cope with whatever comes his way.

358
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,780
 Now this is not denying that there are real challenges.

359
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,520
 This is not a spirituality where we need to, "Oh, you know, everything's great," and it's

360
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,160
 not.

361
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,600
 But Paul is just saying, you know, he can face those things by the power of Jesus, and

362
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:38,360
 he can know peace, he can know joy in the midst of all of that.

363
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,680
 And so in contrast to like self-sufficiency or self-reliance, Paul says, "I am strong

364
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:52,580
 enough because of Jesus, who is my strength, and I can face this, I can get through this."

365
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:58,520
 And so part of my heart for us today is actually I believe that Jesus wants to give us confidence

366
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
 in him.

367
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,760
 Because sometimes we lose confidence in Jesus, even as Christians, and we kind of try to

368
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,480
 hedge our bets and like, maybe this other thing is actually what does really satisfy

369
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,400
 me.

370
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,880
 And that Jesus wants to give us confidence and know it is him and him that we find our

371
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 satisfaction.

372
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:24,100
 It is he who will give us the grace and the strength to be at peace in very difficult

373
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:31,980
 situations and experience, you know, his love and to even have joy that the Holy Spirit

374
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,860
 gives, you know, in those circumstances, even if it doesn't make any sense to people around

375
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,860
 us.

376
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:44,340
 It's like just a little bit earlier in the chapter, Paul talks about that we can come

377
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:50,460
 to Jesus and he gives us a peace that surpasses all understanding, the peace of God, that

378
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,740
 he bestows that on his people.

379
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:02,940
 And so God wants to release his confidence in Jesus that we can face whatever it is that

380
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,420
 we're facing, whatever it is that we're going through, that he can be our strength.

381
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,420
 I can do all of this through him who gives me strength.

382
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,580
 So that we all can say that and we all not just say it, but actually can know that I

383
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:23,100
 can do all things, all of this through him who gives me strength.

384
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:31,740
 Now, it's interesting that Paul, he talks about also that he learned to be content.

385
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,980
 He actually repeats that multiple times in the passage.

386
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,860
 And so there is a thing of like that this doesn't just fall in our laps, but it is actually

387
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:48,060
 as we live life, as we face these challenges and as we struggle with and learn to trust

388
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:57,020
 Jesus with what's going on, as we do that, we experienced that he meets us in that struggle.

389
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,820
 And he does it every time because he is faithful.

390
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,700
 Every time.

391
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,020
 But we struggle and that's the truth, right?

392
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,060
 Like we struggle to actually trust him.

393
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,820
 Very often we don't come to him.

394
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,920
 We try to deal with what's going on in different ways.

395
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:21,100
 But Paul over his lifespan, he learned to continuously come to Jesus.

396
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
 This can be on our own.

397
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,220
 This can also be with others that pray with us, that help us.

398
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:33,400
 You know, and where we entrust what's going on and when we find rest, that God is sovereign

399
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:40,820
 over our circumstances, that he is Lord and he is with us and he will see us through whatever

400
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,480
 it is that we're facing.

401
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:53,040
 And then suddenly the peace of God, you know, falls on us and we get to experience that

402
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,320
 even in the most difficult and challenging circumstances.

403
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,780
 Now, a little bit later in the letter, Paul, he continues to encourage the Philippians

404
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:10,980
 and he says this in Philippians 4 verse 19, he says, "And my God will meet all your needs

405
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,900
 according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus."

406
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
 And I love this.

407
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:24,060
 He's like, "My God, my God can do that for you."

408
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,700
 He's speaking from personal experience because he experienced it for himself.

409
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:36,380
 So he knows that because God has done this for him, he can also do it for you.

410
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:44,620
 My God can meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.

411
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,840
 Wow, that's amazing.

412
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,680
 So Paul is saying we can learn to be content as we walk with Jesus, as we continuously

413
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:02,340
 place our trust in Jesus, you know, and as we experience him meeting us in these circumstances

414
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,060
 and he wants to build our confidence.

415
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,060
 He wants us to know that he is faithful.

416
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:12,900
 We're unfaithful, we struggle, but he is faithful and he is with you and he will walk with you

417
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:18,660
 through whatever it is that you're going on and he will give you peace.

418
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,980
 He can release joy and even satisfaction when it doesn't make sense that your contentment

419
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:34,500
 does not depend on external circumstances.

420
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,140
 Does that sound good?

421
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:47,020
 And I, you know, in my own life, I've shared some struggles here before and so I'm also

422
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,060
 not somebody who easily just preaches this, who has never experienced anything difficult

423
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,820
 or challenging in his life.

424
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:01,200
 You know, I've experienced when I hit my own rock bottom, when the rug was pulled from

425
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:10,380
 underneath my feet and my job, a relationship, my home, you know, all of this was gone.

426
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,980
 Now I wrestled, I wasn't right away content and I've experienced it.

427
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,300
 It was like I prayed once and then, oh, now I'm content.

428
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,020
 Okay, it's all good.

429
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:26,820
 You know, but it was a wrestling and we're talking about months, but Jesus met me and

430
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,140
 he gave me confidence that it is he who sees us through, through whatever struggle, whatever

431
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,720
 difficulty you're experiencing.

432
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,060
 And if my God can do it for me, he can also do it for you.

433
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,060
 Amen.

434
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:55,980
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up.

435
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:04,000
 You know, it's a, as I've been sharing, it is in this personal relationship with Jesus

436
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,260
 that we find true contentment.

437
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,940
 You know, that's where we find peace.

438
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:18,100
 That's where we find rest for our souls.

439
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,900
 And I know it's easy to, you know, to come to church and I don't know everyone's backgrounds.

440
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,980
 You know, some of you, maybe you're a Christian, some of you maybe are not, but as one of the

441
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,020
 responses we'll have, I'll give different ways of responding to this message.

442
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:40,140
 One of them, I just simply want to ask, you know, is there anyone here that wants to invite

443
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,020
 Jesus into their lives?

444
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:51,140
 You know, that says like, Hey, I've, I've experienced this discontent and I just, I

445
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:57,940
 just want to experience this Jesus who meets people and their challenges.

446
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,420
 And you know, if that's you, if you want to invite Jesus in your life and just a moment,

447
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,780
 I'm going to give an opportunity to, but actually you want to ask, can we turn on the lights

448
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:16,680
 a little bit and can we actually close our eyes if that's okay.

449
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,820
 So I want to ask if there, if there's anyone, maybe for a while you've been thinking about

450
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,140
 this, taking the step of faith.

451
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:29,900
 I want to ask if there's anyone who wants to take the step and if you do want to ask

452
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:40,620
 you to maybe just give me a little wave.

453
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,180
 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say a prayer.

454
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:48,340
 I'm going to say a phrase, you know, by phrase and give you space where you can follow it.

455
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,260
 And it's through this prayer that we say, Jesus come into my life.

456
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,020
 Want to be a Christian and you can make this your own prayers.

457
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,140
 I'm going to pray a line and then you can repeat and I'll pray another line and then

458
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,500
 you can repeat.

459
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,220
 And so why don't we do this now?

460
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:14,340
 Jesus, I'm sorry that I have sinned against you and have sinned against other people.

461
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:28,420
 Jesus, thank you that you died for my sins on the cross, that you forgive me.

462
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:35,220
 I place my trust in you.

463
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,740
 Will you come into my life?

464
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:45,060
 Will you fill me with your Holy Spirit?

465
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:51,660
 And will you show me what it means to know you and what it means to live my life for

466
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,700
 you?

467
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,820
 Amen.

468
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:03,620
 Now, if you've prayed this prayer, God's word says if we confess with our tongue that Jesus

469
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,460
 Christ is Lord, you know, we are saved.

470
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,740
 And I would love to help you and, you know, take further steps.

471
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,700
 So afterwards I'll be up front here.

472
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,340
 You can come and we'd just like to guide you more so you know, you know how to move forward

473
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,220
 in this journey.

474
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:28,220
 But right now, what I want to do is as I shared, even as Jesus followers, even as Christians,

475
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,940
 you know, we struggle with discontent and a lot of times our hearts, you know, we get

476
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
 unsure.

477
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
 Can Jesus really help?

478
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,140
 And so we place our trust in other things, in idols.

479
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,340
 You know, we think this thing will make me happy.

480
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
 That's an idol.

481
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,980
 Whatever you think will make you fulfilled and content besides God, you know, that's

482
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,820
 an idol.

483
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:55,060
 And I want to actually just create a space for us to turn to each other.

484
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,460
 Maybe somebody you came with, maybe somebody sitting next to you and you ask them if they're

485
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:07,260
 open to praying with you and just pray that the God will meet you, you know, in this area

486
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:14,180
 of discontent, that he will give you confidence in him, that he is powerful, that he's able

487
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,980
 to see you through whatever it is that's going on.

488
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,300
 And so I want to just give space for five minutes or so to pray with each other.

489
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,020
 It's also okay if you want to just pray on you and you can say, tell the person, "Hey,

490
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
 I just want to pray in a moment."

491
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
 That's okay.

492
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,700
 But why don't we do that right now as a church?

493
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,660
 We'll just take time to pray with each other.

494
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,280
 So turn to each other.

495
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
 Let's pray for one another.

496
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,740
 Let's pray that God meets us in the areas we're struggling to trust him, struggling

497
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,580
 to be confident in him, and just ask him to meet us.

498
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
 So let's do this right now.

499
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,620
 And then in about five minutes or so, I'll come back and I'll pray for us.

500
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
 Amen.

501
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:46,620

 Jesus, you've heard the cry of our hearts.

557
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:23,620
 Will you instill faith and trust in you in our hearts?

558
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,620
 Will you release faith on your people?

559
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:33,620
 Will you lead us into places where there's right now pain,

560
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,620
 there's difficulty, we're just overwhelmed?

561
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620
 Will you give us confidence?

562
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,620
 Will you help us see that you are sovereign over the situation,

563
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,620
 that you stand above it, that you are with us,

564
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:53,620
 that we are not alone, that all power belongs to you,

565
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,620
 that you love us, and you do not withhold your goodness from us,
