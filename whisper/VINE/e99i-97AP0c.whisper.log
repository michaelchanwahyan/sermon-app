[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.820]   "O come, O come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel,
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.640]   who mourn in lonely exile here
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.520]   until the Son of God appears."
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.440]   I wonder if you can hear the longing
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.560]   and the crying out for change
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.920]   that is found in those beautiful lyrics of that famous carol
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.060]   and in the visual imagery that our creative team created
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.020]   in that opener for you.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.000]   Because this longing, this crying out
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.280]   for the Son of God to appear
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.200]   is what sits at the very heart of the Advent season
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.420]   that we enter into today and over the coming Sundays
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.820]   that lead up to Christmas morning.
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.520]   Advent itself is driven actually
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.640]   from the Latin word Adventus,
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.160]   which literally means arrival or coming.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.760]   And here at the Vine over the last many, many years,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.280]   we've always celebrated this idea
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.680]   that we must prepare ourselves as a church
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.120]   for the arrival of Jesus who is born on Christmas day.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.240]   And so Advent in our celebrations here at the Vine
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.260]   for as far back as I can remember
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.520]   have always been about this thought
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.520]   that Christ was born on Christmas day
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.240]   and we need to prepare ourselves for his arrival.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.080]   And so all of our sermon series
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.640]   and everything we've kind of preached during this season
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.200]   has been out of the gospels,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.240]   out of the story in Matthew and Luke of Jesus's birth
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.760]   and the prophetic ways in which that birth happens
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.940]   and the miraculous things that take place in that moment.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.080]   But here's the reality.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.760]   The birth of Jesus is actually just one side
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.800]   of the whole Advent story.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.400]   In fact, the season of Advent historically
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.640]   in the global church for over 2000 years
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.840]   actually contains two sides to its story.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.840]   Yes, it is the side of the story of the arrival of Jesus
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.000]   as a child in Bethlehem in the manger
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.400]   and everything that we've celebrated usually,
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   but it is also the story of Jesus coming back
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.320]   to the world again at the end of all things
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.100]   as a conquering king.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.960]   Advent, if you will, holds intention these two parts
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.380]   of the Christmas story.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.120]   Christmas, you may not realize,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.340]   is not just about the birth of Jesus.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.280]   The birth of Jesus starts the redemptive story
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.120]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.480]   And so Advent as a season for the church
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   also looks forward in longing for the reality
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.680]   of the return of Jesus at the end of all things.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.840]   And when he comes back, he will, if you will,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.160]   complete that total story of redemption
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.060]   of humanity and creation.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.620]   Advent is the wonder of longing
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.220]   for Christmas to be complete.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.180]   It celebrates the birth and the return of Jesus.
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.340]   If you will, Advent is kind of emphasizing the bookends
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.380]   around the redemptive story of Christ,
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.460]   his birth and his return with the idea
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.220]   that if you could really understand
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.540]   what is there at the end of all things,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.140]   if you could really understand what it's like
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.040]   to long for Christ to come and step back into this world,
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.320]   if you can understand that, that actually critically
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.140]   helps you to fully understand what happens
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.740]   on Christmas day.
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.580]   Or I would say it a little bit more challenging
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.480]   to you in this way.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.680]   If you really want to live as best you can
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.320]   as a Christian in this day's world,
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.520]   you don't need to know just only
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.320]   how your Christian story began.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.400]   You also need to know how it will end.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.580]   For once you see what Christ does at the end of all things,
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.580]   it makes everything that happens now
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.840]   come in to the right focus.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.980]   I don't know about you, but I'm the sort of person
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.220]   that actually enjoys watching a movie
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.980]   the second time more than the first time.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.400]   Is anyone else like that?
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.600]   Like when I watch a movie for the first time,
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   I have no idea how that movie's going to end.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.180]   And of course that creates an excitement
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.020]   when you're watching it.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.200]   You're wondering how it's all gonna turn out at the end,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.680]   but it also, at least for me,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.380]   creates a little bit of anxiety.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.040]   I don't know how this is all gonna play out,
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.740]   and I don't know if it's gonna end
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.520]   in a way that I'm gonna be happy with.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.820]   Will it all resolve?
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.120]   Will I leave the theater at the end of watching the movie
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.620]   feeling like all my expectations were met?
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.860]   And so when I watch a movie for the first time,
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.180]   I'm kind of excited, I'm kind of nervous,
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.880]   I don't know how it's gonna turn out.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.980]   But when I watch it the second time,
[00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.060]   I know how it ends.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.360]   And because I know how it ends,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.120]   it informs so much of how I watch it
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.740]   for that second, third, fourth, or fifth time.
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.760]   It's fascinating to me that when I know
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.040]   how the movie's gonna end and resolve itself,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.800]   I actually enjoy it so much more.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.500]   And I get to see all the little nuances
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.280]   that I missed the first time I watched it.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.420]   All those little things that the director included
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.240]   about characterizations and conversations
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.820]   and little plot turns and twists
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.580]   that actually when you've seen it before,
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.420]   you watch it and you go,
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.720]   "Ah, I know what that's really about.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.860]   "Oh, I know what's gonna happen
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.860]   "to that character later on, right?"
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.020]   And it brings this whole different perspective
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.560]   to the movie as a whole.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.600]   I found for me when I watch a movie a second or third time,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.400]   when I know how it ends,
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.140]   I actually find more purpose and joy in the journey itself.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.500]   And I think it's exactly the same for the Bible,
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.180]   for our scriptures.
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.640]   I wonder if you've ever wondered
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.920]   why the Bible doesn't finish
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.880]   with the letters of the New Testament,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.060]   these incredible letters that the writers write
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.920]   about how to live now in the reality of the life, death,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.320]   and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.600]   and letters that were written by the apostles
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.400]   into the churches to help them to understand
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.860]   what life is like now because of all that.
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.740]   Why didn't the Bible just finish with those letters?
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.960]   No, it doesn't.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.580]   The Bible actually finishes with this crazy revelation
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.980]   that God gives John on the island of Patmos,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.980]   where he sees this apocalyptic vision
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.540]   of what the end of the world is going to be like.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.520]   And he writes down all these crazy imageries
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.620]   and all these things that he senses God has given him.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.760]   And right at the end of that book
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.880]   in chapters 21 and 22 of Revelations,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.460]   John shows us what our end of the movie is like.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.960]   And he paints this beautiful picture
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.440]   of how all the world is gonna be made new
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.060]   under this new Jerusalem that comes down to earth.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.680]   And he shows us this picture of a new city
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.440]   coming down from heaven to earth,
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.740]   fulfilling Jesus's prayer.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.320]   When the disciples said, "How should we pray?"
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.680]   He says, "Pray that heaven will come to earth."
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.360]   And we see in Revelation 21 and 22
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.280]   that that's exactly what happens.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.920]   Heaven literally comes to earth in this new city.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.720]   And we find Jesus in the fullness of his presence
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.800]   living for all eternity in that city.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.160]   And not only that, but in those last chapters,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.400]   we see that every tribe and every tongue,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.240]   every race and every background is there in unity together,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.000]   praising God.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.880]   And not only that, but because God is there in his fullness,
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.480]   we suddenly see the end of poverty,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.080]   the end of pain, the end of suffering,
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.280]   the end of need for anything
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.600]   other than the incredible presence of God.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.040]   We see the end of sin, literally,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.320]   and therefore the end of death.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.920]   And all that is in this city is a river that flows,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.440]   a river of life.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.680]   And there are trees on either side of this river
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.860]   and there are leaves for the healing of the nation.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.980]   And everybody who's a part of this city
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.840]   knows for the final time for the rest of their lives,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.680]   the fullness of Shalom,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.560]   what the peace of the Lord is all about.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.740]   It's a glorious vision.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.440]   And the Bible finishes on that vision.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.160]   It's almost like God is peeling the curtain back
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.360]   and going, "Hey, this is how the movie ends."
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.880]   And in the same way that I enjoy movies so much more
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   when I know how they're gonna end,
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.840]   'cause I can find more purpose in my joy of watching it,
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.440]   so I think God pulls the curtain back
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.540]   and shows us the end of all things,
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.480]   shows us Christ returning
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.240]   so that we can find more purpose and joy
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.060]   in how we live today.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.860]   That, my friends, is Advent.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.280]   That is the joy of this season.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.480]   You see, the way we live today
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.720]   is not just informed by what we read in the Gospels,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.280]   as important as the Gospels are.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.760]   It's not just informed by what we see in the life
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.360]   and the death and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.080]   Actually, the Bible presents to us
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.320]   another way of understanding how to live today.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.600]   It's done by seeing what is gonna happen
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.680]   at the end of all things
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.240]   and wanting to live on behalf of that vision today,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.560]   saying, "If this is the future that we're heading into,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.320]   "then how can I live today with purpose, with promise
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.800]   "that gives honor to the future
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.840]   "that God is gonna bring to all of creation?"
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.440]   So listen to this, church.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.000]   Any time that you fight for justice today,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.400]   any time you care for the poor,
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.080]   you give to the needy, you walk with the broken,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.960]   you stand for the abused, you help the vulnerable,
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.680]   any time that you liberate the oppressed,
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.440]   any time that you find yourself being a voice
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.140]   of peace and collaboration and unity amongst people
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.560]   that don't like each other,
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.320]   you're beginning to live as if God's future is now.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.280]   You're beginning to stand in such a way
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.840]   that you say, "Advent matters.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.480]   "This longing that I have inside of me
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.280]   "for the coming of Christ again,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.340]   "I can begin to show the world
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.080]   "what that place will look like."
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920]   We can't create it now,
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.120]   but we can begin to prophetically live in such a way
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.800]   that people would say, "That's a future
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.320]   "I wanna be a part of."
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.280]   Oh, I'm getting excited.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.340]   You're not, but I am, that's okay.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.920]   That's because we wanna live
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.640]   on behalf of this grand vision today.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.060]   This, my friends, is Advent.
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.280]   Not only the celebration of a Savior
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.040]   who stepped into the world as a child,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.280]   but also the longing for the future arrival of a Savior
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.560]   who will step back into the world as a king,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.840]   and then living on behalf of both of those realities today.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.600]   That is Christmas.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.620]   Christmas is so much more than just the reality
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.060]   of Jesus coming as this child.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.580]   Christmas opens up for us a much bigger, wider,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.680]   larger, redemptive narrative
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.320]   that when we celebrate in what has been pulled back
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.400]   from that curtain, and we know how the movie ends,
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.240]   and we live on behalf of both the birth
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.480]   and the return of Christ,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.060]   we begin to show the world something different.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.940]   Christmas should be the most transformative season
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.380]   in the life of the church than any season,
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.820]   because it is Christmas that our story begins
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.300]   and leads us towards its ultimate culmination.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.080]   So it shouldn't surprise us
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.500]   that when the New Testament writers
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.980]   are writing about the life and the death
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.980]   and resurrection of Christ,
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.500]   and when they're writing the letters to the churches
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.620]   to encourage them, that there's this growing sense
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.300]   among the early church that they're desperate
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.660]   for the story to have its completion,
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.860]   that they're desperate for Christ to return,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.840]   and so the New Testament is filled
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.540]   with all of these different speeches and ideas
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.500]   and writings about this return of Christ.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.940]   There's a longing in the early church
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.900]   that Jesus would come back,
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.540]   because they realize that despite the fact
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.580]   that Jesus has been here in his life, death,
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.540]   and resurrection, despite the fact of his ascension
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.500]   and the sending of the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.680]   there's still something that's unfinished in the story,
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.180]   not unfinished in the idea of salvation.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.700]   It's important that you get this.
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.260]   See, salvation has been received to us in its fullness
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.140]   in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.260]   Sin is conquered, sin has been overcome,
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.540]   and anybody who gives their life to Jesus
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.380]   and asks for the forgiveness of their sins
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.620]   is fully saved by him.
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.200]   Yet we also realize, don't we,
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.460]   that there's still an influence of sin on our lives,
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.220]   still an influence of sin in the world around us.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.020]   And you see, the early church felt this.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.260]   They saw the profundity and the power of salvation
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.620]   here in its fullness, and yet they recognized
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.740]   that there was still so much brokenness,
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.260]   sometimes within them and a lot of times within their world,
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.740]   and they therefore cried out,
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.540]   "Lord, if you could just return
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.120]   "and do what you have promised that you will do,
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.040]   "everything will find its rightful place."
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.720]   This is why right at the end of our scriptures,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.200]   literally the very last thing that's written
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.240]   at the end of the Bible in Revelations chapter 22,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.880]   starting in verse 20, it says this.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.480]   He who testifies to these things says,
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.800]   this is Jesus speaking, "Yes, I am coming soon.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.280]   "Amen, come, Lord Jesus."
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.620]   Our Bibles finish on this incredible prayer,
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.880]   maranatha it is in its original text,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.560]   which means come, Lord Jesus.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.860]   And if you were here last week,
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.940]   you'll remember this is not the come, Lord Jesus,
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.540]   in the sense that right now,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.300]   we don't have enough of your presence.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.420]   We said last week, right,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.780]   that the fullness of the presence of God is in us
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.860]   as we come to relationship with Christ.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.180]   The fullness of the presence of God is in this world
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.740]   in its omnipotence.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.980]   This is not a crying out for more of some sort of momentary
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.360]   infilling, this maranatha, come, Lord Jesus,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.220]   is a crying out for Christ to return,
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.300]   crying out for that Revelation 21, 22 picture
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.120]   so that the world would know the shalom
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.660]   that God has always promised it.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.300]   This is the church saying, we are not satisfied.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.480]   There is more.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:17.000]   I love this idea because when the New Testament writers
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.720]   write about this, they understand
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   that the world is still not quite as God desires it to be.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.740]   And this fueled their evangelism.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.600]   This fueled their compassion.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.960]   This is why they were just and hopeful.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.220]   This is why they spoke into all areas
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.220]   of the Greek Roman society.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.540]   This is why the gospel went out from Jerusalem,
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.000]   Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the world,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.360]   because they realized that they had a role to play,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.440]   that because Christ is coming back,
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.160]   because there is the river of life,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.860]   because sin will be gone, because all the nations
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.500]   will come together and worship God,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.960]   there is work to do today.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.680]   So if Christmas is anything for us,
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.080]   if Advent is anything for us,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.580]   it should be the most mobilizing season
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.680]   that the church experiences.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.120]   It should light a fire inside of us
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.480]   to say there's a story that needs to be told to this world
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.960]   because right now we're sitting between these two bookends.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.880]   He's come, He is coming,
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.840]   and we're in this moment,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.780]   which is one of the most precious moments of history,
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.660]   where we've seen Him, we know Him, and He will come again.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.920]   The New Testament and scholars,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.280]   as they've studied the scriptures,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.720]   they've coined this term that we all live in
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.520]   as this idea of the now but not yet.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.680]   It's an academic term, but it's helpful, I think.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.960]   The now but not yet is the season that we're in.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   The now but not yet is the longing and the cry of Advent.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.280]   Now in the sense that Christ has come,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.480]   and as Kyle has shared during our communion time,
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.060]   was on the cross and said those words, it is finished.
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.220]   That the wages of sin are death,
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.240]   but because of Christ and His resurrection,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.040]   those wages have been paid for.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.000]   We now know the fullness of life in relation to Him.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.020]   It is done, that's the now.
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.820]   But yet there is this not yet.
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.840]   There is the reality that sin is still at work,
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:27.680]   there is this reality
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.400]   that we still see brokenness in the world.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.280]   There is this reality that people still suffer,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.040]   that there is still death,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.960]   and that longing inside of us for that reality
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.480]   that we see at the end of Revelation 21 and 22,
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.280]   and that glorious picture of the return of Christ.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.720]   That sits on our hearts together as well.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.320]   And so we're in the now, we're in this not yet,
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.240]   and as we sit in the middle of that,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.360]   that's where we find Advent.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.860]   That's where the Maranatha cries from our spirit.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:02.040]   Come, Lord Jesus, 'cause I wanna see my family revived.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.680]   Come, Lord Jesus, 'cause I wanna see my businesses.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.120]   I wanna see the workplace.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.440]   I wanna see everybody that I know know you.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.800]   Come, Lord Jesus.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.240]   This is the crazy thing about the now but not yet.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.020]   Christ is coming again.
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.400]   And because he's coming again,
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.340]   that should change everything now.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.760]   There's so many ways of thinking about this in Scripture,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   but I wanna read you one of the passages
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.360]   that I find most helpful,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   particularly when it comes to the idea of Christmas
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.120]   and Advent, and this is found in Paul's writings
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.480]   in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.880]   And if you're just journeying
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.000]   or beginning your journey of faith here,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.920]   maybe this passage is well-known to you
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.360]   just from the weddings you've attended.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.600]   It's often the passage that's read at weddings.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.940]   If you've been a Christian here for many years,
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.040]   you'll know this passage.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.260]   The first seven verses are this beautiful chorus about love,
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.360]   and it's one of the most celebrated sections
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.800]   of Scripture that we have.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.880]   But I wanna read the following verses
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.960]   after those first seven.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.320]   This is verses eight to 13.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.060]   And in these verses, we see a slightly different story.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:09.500]   In fact, Paul goes from this glorious idea of what love is
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.580]   to the reality of the now but not yet time
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.900]   that we're living in.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.180]   And when you read them, it feels a little bit jarring,
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.340]   but when you open up what Paul's trying to say,
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   everything begins to fit together.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.060]   These verses I'm about to read, if you will,
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.900]   if you're here and you have an oldest sibling,
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.660]   and this happens quite a lot in our culture in Asia,
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.900]   if you've got an oldest sibling,
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.180]   and your parents think that the sun shines out of them
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.620]   all the time, and you've always felt like you're in the
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.420]   shadow of your oldest sibling,
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.860]   then you'll resonate with these verses, okay?
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.060]   'Cause these verses are in the shadow of that amazing
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.580]   section on love, but there is so much wonder here.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.740]   Let me read this to you.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.860]   1 Corinthians 13, starting in verse eight.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.020]   Love never fails, but where there are prophecies,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.380]   they will cease.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.600]   Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.540]   Where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.880]   Notice this, for we know in part and we prophesy in part.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.220]   But then he says this, but when perfection comes,
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.300]   the imperfect disappears.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.160]   You see, when I was a child, I taught like a child.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.300]   I thought like a child.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.740]   I reasoned like a child.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.580]   But when I became a man, I put these childish ways
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.820]   behind me.
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.180]   Now we see, but a poor reflection as in a mirror.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.440]   Then we will see face to face.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.700]   Now I know in part, then I shall know fully,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.420]   even as I am fully known.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:31.260]   And these three things remain, faith, hope, and love.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.660]   But the greatest of these is love.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.260]   I love how Paul begins this.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.320]   This whole section he's speaking about the now,
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.360]   but not yet tension of how Christ has come,
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.600]   and yet we long for him to come again.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.840]   Look at what he says at the start.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.960]   He says, love never fails, but where there are prophecies,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.800]   they will cease.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.540]   Where there is tongues, they will be stilled.
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.140]   Where there is knowledge, it's gonna pass away.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.840]   For we know in part, we prophesy in part,
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.160]   but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.920]   He's saying this, look, we need to understand
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.720]   that we're longing for a time where perfection comes.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.920]   He's speaking there metaphorically
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.520]   about the return of Jesus.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.740]   And when perfection comes, all this imperfect stuff
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.580]   that we're feeling right now, it disappears.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.500]   And he names some really amazing things.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.060]   He talks about prophecy,
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.220]   and he talks about wisdom and knowledge,
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.580]   but he says you need to understand
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.220]   that even in the prophetic,
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.820]   even in the wisdom and the knowledge,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.860]   we only prophesy and we only know in part.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.020]   We don't know everything he's saying to the church.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.820]   We can't because we're in this now, but not yet.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.560]   There's a longing and there's a crying out
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.260]   because we don't have all the answers,
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.820]   that there are these gaps.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.260]   We don't know it all he's saying.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.260]   But when perfection comes, everything that's imperfect,
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.340]   even all the lack of knowledge and all that goes,
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.100]   because suddenly perfection is with us.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.180]   He comments again, let me read this to you in verse 12.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:52.300]   He says it this way.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.380]   He says, "Now, in this time of now, but not yet,
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.020]   "we see, but a poor reflection is in a mirror.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.860]   "But then when Christ returns, we will see face to face.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.260]   "Now I only know in part, then I shall know fully,
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.420]   "even though right now I am fully known."
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.620]   This is so profound.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.420]   I want you to remember, this is Paul writing to his church.
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.020]   Paul, who previously was the Hebrew of Hebrews,
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.140]   was one of the most learned people
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.620]   in the Jewish religion of his day.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.860]   He prided himself on the knowledge of scripture
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.020]   and the knowledge of understanding of who God is,
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.320]   his character and his life.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.340]   That was what he celebrated.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.500]   And he has the humility now,
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.460]   now that he's come into relationship with Jesus,
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.220]   now he's come to understand the birth
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.900]   and yet the second coming.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.580]   Now he's come to realize the now, but not yet,
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.400]   that he's sitting in.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.540]   He has the humility to write to his church
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.140]   and says, "I know only in part."
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.700]   "I don't have it all figured out," he said.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.860]   I love this.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.020]   This frees me as a pastor,
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:54.860]   'cause I can stand before you and say,
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.700]   "I don't have it all figured out."
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.420]   'Cause if the apostle Paul didn't have it figured out,
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.720]   I don't have it figured out either.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.560]   He writes to his church.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.080]   Now remember, 1 Corinthians is a letter Paul's writing
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.680]   in reply to another letter that Paul's written,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.520]   sorry, that the church wrote Paul.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.660]   We don't have a copy of that letter,
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.320]   but the letter that the church wrote Paul
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.080]   had a list of all these questions in it for him.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.200]   And in 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.200]   he does try to answer some of those questions.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.360]   But then in this section, he says,
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.040]   "But you need to understand, church,
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.200]   "even though I'll do my best to give you some wisdom here,
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.640]   "we only prophesy in part.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.260]   "We only are wise in part.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.600]   "I don't know it all," he's saying.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.340]   In other words, there are going to,
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.620]   in this now but not yet season,
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.800]   there's going to be gaps,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.020]   gaps in our knowledge,
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.160]   gaps in our prophecy,
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.400]   gaps in our understanding,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.340]   gaps in our vision.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.940]   We're not gonna have it all sorted out.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.960]   But then he says this,
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.140]   "One day when he returns, we will see face to face,
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:53.380]   "and in that moment, I will know it all.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.220]   "But right now, I don't."
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.580]   But then he says this crazy thing.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:58.780]   He goes this, he kinda like,
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.020]   I almost feel like as he's writing this,
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.500]   he leans into the church.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.640]   He leans in and goes, "But guess what?
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.220]   "I know one who does know it all.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.060]   "'Cause although right now, I don't have all the answers.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.380]   "Although right now, there are gaps for me,
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.720]   "there is one that I know who is coming back.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.540]   "And when he comes back, we're all gonna know.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.680]   "But right now, even though I don't know everything,
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.540]   "he right now knows everything.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.140]   "He right now has all the answers.
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.220]   "He right now can step in and show himself to his fullness.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.640]   "I may be seeing in a mirror slightly darkly.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.900]   "There's no filter for God," he's saying to the church.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.780]   "There's no break for him.
[00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.300]   "He sees everything fully right now."
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.500]   And it's almost like Paul is saying,
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.460]   "It is okay for me not to know everything,
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.160]   "because I know the one who does."
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.260]   Okay, let me break this down for you a little bit more,
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.380]   'cause I wanna show you really the beauty of this
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.580]   and then show you how this links into Advent.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:58.020]   Has this been helping so far?
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.980]   I'm glad I came back.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.740]   I'm just gonna go back to Spain.
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.140]   Walk another 800, no, okay.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:13.020]   All right, so I apologize up front for my writing,
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.100]   but follow this, okay.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.140]   Here's what Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.540]   He's basically going, look, he's like,
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.700]   "There is this world right now that we all know,
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.980]   "and this world is kinda messed up."
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.980]   The word he uses, he says, "It's imperfect," right?
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:29.660]   There's this imperfection that's happening right now
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.940]   in our world, but then he says,
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.420]   "You also need to understand
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.740]   "that there's this world that's coming
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.020]   "when Christ returns."
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.700]   This is gonna look like a sun, but it's not.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.180]   It's the amazing, redeemed, and renewed world
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.140]   that Christ is in the center of.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.180]   And he says, "This world, this time, is perfect."
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.720]   So right now, he's saying, "We know imperfection
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.180]   "in the future when Christ returns,
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.780]   "everything will be perfect."
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.000]   And he's basically saying, "We live right now
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.360]   "in this now, but not yet tension
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.200]   "between these two times.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.040]   "This is the lot for every human being right now.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.360]   "We're sitting in between the imperfect that we know,
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.520]   "the fact that I don't know it all,
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.860]   "that there are gaps for me,
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.240]   "and this perfect return of Christ that's gonna happen."
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.200]   And he basically says, "You need to understand
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.640]   "that there, in this time, there are gaps.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.240]   "There are gaps for all of us," Paul is saying.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.280]   And the reason why he's trying to teach his church this,
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.480]   the reason why I'm trying to teach you it here this morning
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.360]   is because it's actually in these gaps
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.760]   where Advent is found.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.400]   Let me explain that.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   If you're anything like me, and I'm sure you are,
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.960]   we don't like the gaps.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.160]   The gaps during the now, but not yet time
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.800]   are the hardest things about this time.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.640]   I don't know about you,
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.800]   but I wish I did have all the answers.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.400]   But there are gaps, and there are gaps in our lives.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.800]   Things happen that we have no control of.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.760]   Something takes place in our work that we can't explain.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.160]   There's a breakdown in a relationship, and it's hurt us.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.640]   There are wounds that we're carrying
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.440]   that we don't seem to get healed from.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.800]   There are questions that we're holding on our hearts
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.720]   that don't seem to get answered.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.760]   There is stuff that we've been doing with God
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.360]   that we thought would bring a breakthrough
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.040]   doesn't seem to be a breakthrough.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.080]   There are gaps, Paul is saying,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.160]   between the time of the imperfect
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.000]   and this perfection that will come.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.200]   But we so as human beings don't like the gaps
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.080]   that here's what we do in the gaps.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.720]   We try to fill them with ourselves.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.840]   We try to look within ourselves to try to fill the gaps.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.560]   In other words, we want to control
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.400]   what Paul is saying here is uncontrollable.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.400]   We wanna try to fill those gaps.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.960]   So for example, I don't know, Lord,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.400]   when I'm gonna get a job, how am I gonna get a job?
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.440]   And we try our very best and we get so stressed
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.000]   of trying to work things out.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.960]   Or I don't know, Lord, how I'm gonna save my marriage.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.440]   And we're trying our best, but we can't sort it all out.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.600]   We work really hard and we get ourselves
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.680]   into places of worry, anxiety, stress, depression,
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.800]   because there are gaps, we don't like gaps,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.960]   and we're trying to fill the gaps with ourselves.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.440]   Are you with me?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.000]   And what Paul's writing to the church is,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.080]   no, you gotta understand, we live in the now but not yet.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.760]   This is the cry of Advent.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.240]   You wanna know what Advent is?
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.640]   Advent is standing in the gap
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.760]   and not trying to solve it yourself.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.600]   Advent is standing in the gap and crying out and going,
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.840]   I know in part, but that doesn't mean I'm a failure.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.080]   What it means is that I know the one who knows it all.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.200]   The gap is where the carol comes.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   Oh come, oh come, Emmanuel, and ransom captive Israel
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.720]   who mourn in lonely exile here in the gap,
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.680]   waiting until the Son of God appears.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:01.120]   Maranatha, come Lord Jesus, is not an escapism.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.140]   It's not some sort of whimsical idea.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.560]   It is the cry of those that live in the gaps
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.240]   who are saying I know and trust and believe
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   that there is one who can set all things right.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.440]   The gaps are an opportunity, yes,
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.160]   for us to potentially worry and get stressed
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.640]   and overwhelmed and depressed,
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.040]   but the gaps are also one of the most profound invitations
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.200]   you will ever have to a greater relationship with God.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:34.440]   Could it be that God has given us this now but not yet time
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.440]   and given us these gaps that we like to try to control
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.480]   and fill so that we can't control and fill them,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.020]   but instead discover Him?
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:48.520]   That, my friends, I believe,
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.840]   is what Christmas is all about.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.640]   It's what Advent is.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.760]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.920]   Paul goes, and you know what?
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.200]   God in His mercy hasn't left us alone
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   trying to maybe, some people might be able
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.240]   to work this out, some won't.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.440]   He says there's actually three things that God has given us
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.800]   that are values, vehicles, ways in which we can reach out
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.040]   beyond ourselves towards Him who knows it all.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.400]   Verse 13, and now these three things remain,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.640]   faith, hope, and love.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.280]   The greatest of these, he says, is love.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.560]   This is Paul basically saying you've gotta understand
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.960]   something that's really, really important here.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.220]   He said in the place of these gaps, there is faith,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.080]   there is faith, there is hope, there is love.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.440]   We may not have all the answers,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.160]   we may not be able to always get all the answers,
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.440]   but it is not that God stands back,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.560]   looks at our gaps in our lives, and goes,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.520]   (laughing)
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.040]   Paul's saying, no, no, we're not alone in the gaps.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.080]   We have the gaps.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.040]   I don't know it all.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.920]   He knows it all.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.120]   One day I will know it all.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.560]   When He comes back, I hope He comes back soon,
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.200]   but in this moment, He's deposited by His Spirit
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.760]   and by His church and in His word three things
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.240]   that enable me not to have all the answers,
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.520]   but enable me to reach out of myself and towards Him,
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.320]   enable the gaps to become a place of advent,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.480]   of longing, of wishing, of hoping for the arrival of God.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.340]   Faith inside of me that believes that He wasn't just born
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.800]   in that manger as a child, but He will come back,
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.480]   and that the curtain that is being pulled back
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.960]   in Revelation 21 and 22 is not just some fantastic idea.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.000]   It's the literal thing that will happen
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.040]   at the end of all things.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.120]   Hope, hope that that story is part of my story.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.360]   Hope that even when I feel a long way away from the coming,
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.320]   I can trust that God will do what He says He's gonna do.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.600]   Love, love that so fills me and changes me,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.080]   that because I know He was born, I know He's coming back,
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.400]   and I know He's here in the fullness
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   in His presence right now.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.080]   I have a place to know and feel and encounter love,
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.880]   and because He first loved me, I can now love.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.160]   That's why this is the greatest of the three,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.240]   because I now can walk in the love of Christ
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.500]   to all those around me, and if I really want to advent well,
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:19.220]   then it found in how I love true and well.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.480]   Faith, hope, and love.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.340]   Paul says this is it, and I think that's the most beautiful
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.520]   summary of what advent is all about,
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.900]   this bookends of Christ's redemptive story
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.680]   that welcomes us in to the reality that there are gaps, yes,
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.620]   and that those gaps are hard and uncomfortable, yes,
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:47.320]   but those gaps can lead us to the one who knows it all.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.120]   If there's not a better message for Christmas,
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.800]   then I don't know what there is.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.080]   My prayer is that you will go into your workplace tomorrow
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.280]   and go, let me tell you about the bookends,
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.820]   because now I know about the bookends.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.700]   Let me tell you about the gaps.
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.540]   You've got a gap, I've got a gap, we've all got gaps,
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.500]   but those gaps don't have to be the end for you.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.740]   They're not the end for me, and although maybe
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.340]   those gaps don't get answered the way I think
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.120]   they're gonna get answered, those gaps are an invitation
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.980]   to find the God of the gaps.
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:19.100]   So here's what I want to encourage you to do this week.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.460]   I want to help you to just reframe some things in your mind
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.820]   to find that longing inside of you
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.500]   that is what Advent is all about,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.200]   and over the next three Sundays,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.460]   we're gonna take faith, hope, and love,
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.600]   and we're gonna use these three themes as the center point
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.860]   for understanding both the birth of Christ,
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.620]   'cause those three things, faith, hope, and love,
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.900]   are framed in the birth of Christ,
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.060]   and then see how they are framed in his second coming,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.100]   and as we do that, I pray that you will encounter
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.100]   more faith and hope and love in the now,
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.800]   but not yet in between.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.680]   So to get you prepared for that,
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.100]   here's a little exercise I want you to do this week,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.900]   and by the way, when I say I want you to do it,
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.460]   I actually mean that I want you to do it.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.860]   I don't want you just to take a photo of the slide
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.700]   and go, "That was a nice sermon today."
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.360]   I actually want you to do it,
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.180]   because I think it can help change your heart
[00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.660]   and get you ready for Advent.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.860]   So I'm gonna kinda get out of the way,
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.560]   and you can take a photo of this next slide,
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.380]   but let me read you these four reflections
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.860]   I want you to think about this week.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.020]   Where and what are the gaps in this now but not yet time
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.300]   that overwhelm me or overwhelm you?
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.540]   What are some of the longings that sit within you
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.780]   that are far beyond your own ability to achieve?
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.060]   Where do you see in your own life the tension
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.540]   between the fullness of salvation received
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.420]   and yet the reality of the ongoing work of sin?
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.700]   Okay, that's a very personal one for you.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.220]   What burdens do you carry for yourself,
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.700]   others, or this world that burn
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.100]   a righteous justice within you?
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.540]   That's the positive thing.
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.660]   That's the, "Hey, let's fight for injustice now.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.640]   "Let's make this work.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.380]   "Let's stand for the poor and the needy."
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.660]   What burdens sit within you that are like a cry
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.420]   of your heart to help those around you?
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.260]   That's the cry of Advent.
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.220]   In the same way, what sin still overwhelms me at time
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.580]   and seems to have a grip on me,
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.180]   even though I know it's fully paid for,
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.500]   but it still seems to have a grip on me,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.660]   the honesty of that, that's also Advent.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.240]   So it's this beautiful reflection
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.100]   that we can find in ourselves
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.940]   that helps to trigger our understanding
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.420]   of where we're at as we enter into this Christmas season,
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.060]   where we look at both the birth
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.240]   and the return of our Savior.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.880]   Does that sound helpful to you?
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.220]   All right, can we just pray together?
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.060]   Let's pray.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:40.300]   Father, as we enter into the season of Advent
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.260]   here at The Vine, and as we focus on faith,
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.460]   hope, and love in the weeks ahead,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.420]   as we celebrate your birth,
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.540]   understand this longing we should have for your return,
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.420]   putting those two things into balance
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.800]   as bookends around your redemptive story,
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.540]   and as we find ourselves as Paul
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.100]   has so beautifully shown us this morning,
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.520]   the gaps that are there,
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:06.940]   and yet the liberation we can have from fear,
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.220]   anxiety, worry, depression, from not knowing it all,
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.300]   and instead the gaps being a springboard,
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.380]   a catalyst towards greater trust, faith, hope,
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.220]   love with you.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.100]   Father, that's my prayer for every person here at The Vine,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.100]   and everybody watching online in this moment.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.380]   My prayer is that they would find themselves
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.320]   catalyzed at Advent this year,
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.660]   to find that longing inside of them,
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.640]   the crying out within them for the Son of God to appear,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.580]   that the gaps that they are very aware of
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:41.820]   in their lives right now,
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.820]   where anxiety, and fear, and worry
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.140]   has been the thing that has driven
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.060]   their sense of the need to control the gaps in their lives.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.860]   I wanna pray for a releasing right now
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.300]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.860]   I wanna pray that this Advent season
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.780]   will be a shift for many in this room,
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.620]   for many watching online.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.580]   I believe that where the gaps have created anxiety,
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.300]   the gaps are now gonna create faith in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.540]   The gaps are now gonna birth hope in their hearts
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.060]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.500]   The gaps are gonna create a deeper love for you
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.900]   and for others around them in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:22.540]   What the enemy has stolen from the gaps.
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.540]   Lord, I pray that you would recatalyze
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.660]   by your spirit amongst the vine over the next three weeks.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.500]   Lord, I pray that you would light that Advent fire in us,
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.580]   that we would look forward to celebrating your birth
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.740]   in the manger of Bethlehem that night,
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:41.020]   but we would also long for your return as a reigning king,
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.260]   and that would fuel and drive our purpose,
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.420]   and our ministry, and our sharing of the gospel
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.660]   with our friends and family,
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.340]   of all the action that you're calling us to do,
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.500]   and it would more than anything catalyze the gaps,
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.260]   where we say like Paul would humble himself
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.540]   before his church and say,
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.340]   "I don't have all the answers, but I know the one who does."
[00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.740]   And Lord, if there's anyone in this room
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.180]   or watching online right now,
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.380]   where they would say they don't know that God.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.500]   Father, I wanna pray that this moment right here,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.580]   and the moments over Advent
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.860]   as we lead up to the celebration of the birth of Jesus,
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.380]   would be a birthing moment for them.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.020]   Your scriptures speak about a new birth,
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.700]   that we become a new creation in you
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.820]   when we come into relationship with you.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.920]   So Lord, I wanna pray anyone in this room,
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.620]   maybe they've been invited here today
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.180]   by a friend or a family member,
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.860]   and maybe as they think about Christmas,
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.860]   they've always wondered what's this really about?
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.780]   Is it just about buying things?
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.820]   Is it just commercial?
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.580]   Is it just material?
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.980]   And they're here today realizing
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.700]   that it's about a much bigger story,
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.940]   a story that they're swept up in,
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.540]   that they are caught up in.
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.700]   And if you're sitting here right now
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.580]   and you don't know Jesus,
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.700]   you are caught up in this crazy story,
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.460]   whether you realize it or not.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.420]   And the Bible tells us that Christ is returning
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.780]   and that we will see him one day face to face.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.980]   My prayer for you is that you,
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.620]   as you face him face to face,
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.460]   he would say to you,
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.020]   well done my good and faithful son or daughter,
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.380]   my good and faithful child.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.060]   And he'll welcome you into that incredible city
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.540]   where for all eternity you will be able to spend with him.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.660]   And so I wanna pray just as our eyes are closed,
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.300]   heads are bowed,
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.560]   if anyone in this room that's your desire today,
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.580]   you've heard what we've been talking about today
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.580]   and you're like, you know what?
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.300]   I realize that the gaps in my life
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.340]   are causing more anxiety in me than I need.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.620]   And I want the gaps to be filled with something else.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.820]   I want that faith,
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.700]   that hope and that love that Andrew was speaking about.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.300]   Well, I want you to know that that's available to you
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.340]   right in this moment.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.300]   And while the journey of being a Christian
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.260]   is a lifelong journey,
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.300]   it begins with a simple prayer.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.820]   It's a prayer that just acknowledges
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.500]   that you know what the gaps are like,
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.820]   acknowledges that you have been living in those gaps,
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.260]   that you don't have all the answers,
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.980]   that there is sin and brokenness in your life.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.940]   And that prayer is a simple acknowledgement
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.540]   that there is one who is perfect,
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.180]   one who is full of love,
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.700]   one who can save you from that brokenness within.
[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.100]   And so if that's you, I'm just gonna invite you now,
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.100]   as all of our eyes are closed,
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.740]   I'm just gonna invite you to pray.
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.940]   And in fact, we're all gonna pray together,
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.540]   but if this is you,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.780]   this is you praying this for the first time,
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.980]   this is your way of saying,
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.700]   I wanna this to build and create
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.820]   and have this relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:44.940]   And if you pray this prayer for the first time,
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.540]   I want you to either share with the person
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.180]   who invited you afterwards,
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.540]   or you can come forward and share with our team,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.540]   or share with somebody outside afterwards.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.740]   There's lots of people here
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.580]   that would love to help you in this journey
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.140]   that you're about to step into.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.460]   And so as a church community,
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.300]   and if this is for you for the first time,
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.540]   all of us are gonna pray this out loud,
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.140]   but this is for you too.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.740]   Let's just pray this, Lord Jesus,
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.860]   I wanna thank you for dying for me,
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.180]   for going to the cross,
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:16.820]   to pay the price for my sin.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.260]   I recognize that I have done some things
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.020]   that have hurt you,
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.620]   that have hurt me,
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.300]   that have hurt others.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.580]   And I ask in this moment,
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.780]   that you would forgive me.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.260]   And I invite you to now come into my life.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.820]   I invite you to forgive me.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.220]   I accept your grace.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.540]   And I ask that your Holy Spirit,
[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.660]   your love and your joy and your peace,
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.900]   would be in me now,
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.500]   now and forever.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:00.540]   And I thank you for this,
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.260]   in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.460]   All right, we can open our eyes.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.660]   Why don't we give a round of applause for anyone here,
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.300]   whether online, in this room.
[00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.700]   (congregation applauding)
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.300]   You've made that prayer for the first time,
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.780]   we're so excited for you.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.540]   Please do share with the person you came with,
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.700]   or share with us afterwards.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.380]   We'd love to help you in your walk.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.900]   For the rest of us, well, for all of us,
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.940]   why don't we stand together,
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.100]   and we're going to just respond together
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.980]   in one more time of worship.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.620]   (gentle music)
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.200]   (gentle music)
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   [MUSIC]
