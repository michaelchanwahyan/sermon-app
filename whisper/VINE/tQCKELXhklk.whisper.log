[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320]   Francesca, awesome.
[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.560]   You know, I can't say yes 'cause I have two daughters,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.760]   so I'm trained.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.960]   You know, you must say yeah, I love them equally.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.960]   Anyway, so, hi, hi sweetheart.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.800]   So I'm gonna put a word on the screen right now,
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.080]   and can you tell me what it means?
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.240]   All right, so, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.160]   So how many of you think it means this?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.400]   Right, okay, some of you, some of you.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.320]   You know what?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.800]   By putting up your hand, you actually just revealed
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.960]   your age. (laughs)
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.320]   I actually learned this word about a year ago
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.160]   from Benedict and Justin.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.760]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.600]   In case you don't know,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.160]   they are our core team leaders at the church.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.040]   They've been serving ever since the beginning
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   of this church plan, and they just happen to be Gen Z-ish.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.560]   Ish?
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.080]   You know he's not, okay, he's not, okay.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.920]   So ish, ish.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.320]   So yes, you may refer to a cap
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.480]   as whatever I was wearing on my head,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.480]   but let me give you a definition of Gen Z cap.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.840]   Cap is Gen Z slang.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.680]   That means lying, you know, or it's forced.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.080]   And so when someone is lying, they are capping.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.320]   And so that's why when they wanna tell you I'm not lying,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.040]   whatever I'm saying is absolute truth,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.520]   they will say no caps.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.040]   Say I just taught you guys some Gen Z slang, right?
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.000]   You're following, all right?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Now there are more.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200]   I'm gonna put some more on the screen.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.320]   I was scrolling on Instagram the other day,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.200]   and I chanced upon this, and I immediately saved this.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.160]   'Cause I'm like, next time I'm talking to Gen Z or Gen Alpha,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.840]   or next time when my daughter comes home from school,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.140]   and she started like saying things I don't understand,
[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.760]   I just better educate myself.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.680]   So for example, it's time to eat.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.120]   That's what we millennials say.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.240]   It's time to eat.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600]   And Gen Z would say it's time to feast.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.040]   And I don't even know what this is, basically.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.800]   I'm exhausted, I'm so drained, my energy is Ohio.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.560]   Like, what's that?
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.960]   Anyway, so what I want to say is,
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.800]   guys, generation gap, it's real.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.840]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.200]   Amen?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.480]   But I don't know if you've ever thought about
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.040]   why would there be generational gaps?
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.520]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.880]   This is indeed one of the questions that sociologists,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.960]   anthropologists, cultural scholars,
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.760]   they all devote time to look into.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.700]   And so I'm just gonna put a definition by sociologists,
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.160]   what they think about generational gap.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.300]   They think it is a divergence in beliefs and outlooks
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.900]   between age cohorts, often leading to misunderstandings
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.000]   or conflicts between younger and older generation.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.680]   This gap is influenced by rapid social change,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.960]   technological advancement, and shifting cultural norms,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.800]   which cause younger generations to adopt new values
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.560]   and behaviors that older generations may find unfamiliar
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.220]   or difficult to accept.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.520]   Let me give you an example.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.040]   On IG, I don't know why these videos keep popping up,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.600]   but there will be two guys, actually the same guy,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.520]   but he filmed two version of himself.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.080]   He'll stand like side by side,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.920]   and this guy would say he's a millennial,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.240]   this guy is a Gen Z,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.120]   and they start putting outfit on themselves,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.440]   and a millennial would dress up like me,
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.440]   like skinny jeans, and everything has to be tight,
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.440]   unless you're like me, growing in your body size,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.000]   you can't wear something too tight.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.980]   But whatever the Gen Z is doing,
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.740]   they wear something super loose,
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.240]   and if you wanna know how that looks,
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.200]   you can look at Pastor Ivan at the back there.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.320]   That's how Gen Z would dress like.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.400]   He's young, right?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.520]   He dress young.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.080]   Anyway, but for my generation,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.720]   we thought, oh, we don't like that kind of fashion.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.840]   Like that's ill, like we like this.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.800]   So there are things that the older generation cannot accept.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   They thought, that's not good, that's no good.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   That's not nice, that's not beauty,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.900]   that's not aesthetics,
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.520]   but the younger generation may embrace it.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   On the other hand, and this sometimes would become
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.400]   what sociologists call an institutional age segregation.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.200]   So this would happen in a society
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840]   when different age groups,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.740]   they tend to, they're separated in different social spheres.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.160]   Let's say it affects how we socialize.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.740]   It affects how our identity is formed.
[00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.740]   It would affect the way we interact with our family members,
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.960]   our family dynamics are impacted.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.720]   Sometimes it affects a workplace culture.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.560]   If you know, I don't know,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.240]   like we don't have this at church.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.200]   We're all similar age here,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.240]   so we don't experience this at church here,
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.320]   like among us.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.480]   (laughing)
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.440]   So it affects your workplace culture
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.000]   and even societal cohesion.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.920]   In the last decade, I guess,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.240]   when social media really became a thing
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.700]   and we see these polarized views
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.680]   or these like institutional, social,
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.320]   or age segregation is happening online.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.120]   And so whenever there's an issue,
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.800]   a social issue, political issue,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.560]   or just food issue, whatever,
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.800]   and you would see polarized comments
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.480]   and people would really like get different,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.120]   they get into different camps
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.680]   and you see that kind of barriers between different people.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.080]   And we may or may not have experienced
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.000]   a little bit of that in the last decade
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.840]   or even in recent years.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.040]   So at first I thought, yeah,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.760]   if generational gap is a result of rapid social change
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.560]   and the technological advancement,
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   I thought, oh, so this phenomenon must be new
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.240]   in the long human history.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.920]   It must be something quite reason.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.280]   And man, I was so wrong
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.400]   when I started researching on this topic.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   I found that the idea of this generational gap
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.100]   expressed in this concept that young people today
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.880]   are not as good as the previous generation.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.400]   Now, if you grew up in a Chinese community like me,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   then we hear that all the time,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.320]   but I don't know about a more westernized kind of culture,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.160]   but this kind of thought and idea,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.520]   if we try to dig it up in history,
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.040]   we can find this same idea
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.720]   that young people don't measure up
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.160]   to their previous generation.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.760]   We found that in ancient Greek writings,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.880]   I'm talking about the sixth or seventh century BC.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.140]   That's how old this idea is.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.380]   That's even way before Jesus was born.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.160]   And so this generational gap
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.220]   or the older generation looking down on the next generation,
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.440]   it has always been a part of human history.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.400]   So now I'm thinking about this.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.680]   If I look deeper,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.720]   although it may appear to be a social problem at first,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.280]   but would it be,
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.720]   actually there's a spiritual problem at play here.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.680]   And so if I look at the Bible,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.720]   the earliest account of division
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.060]   among a large group of people
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.720]   is recorded in Genesis chapter 11
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.740]   in a place called the Babel.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.000]   That was the place where people
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.700]   were trying to build a tower
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.900]   so that they could build a name for themselves,
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.080]   but God disrupted them
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.820]   and disrupted their plans by confusing their language.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.540]   And so they could no longer understand one another.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.340]   And they immediately, they break up,
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.960]   they got separated into different groups.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.220]   Because of that,
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.440]   like humans started to experience division through language.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.820]   And then it becomes cultures or ethnicity.
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.420]   And then we have different pockets of people
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.620]   in different ethnicity, in different languages,
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.900]   in different cultures.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.900]   And that becomes how people get separated in the first place.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.500]   Of course, in the fallen human nature,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.300]   we see things just get worse and worse and worse.
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.320]   We see more and more conflict.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.620]   We see more separation between different people,
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.820]   between different groups, between different nations.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.860]   If we look at that,
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.040]   this kind of separation or division
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.700]   among cultures and language,
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.220]   we can call that a horizontal division, if you will.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.220]   But humanity, we also experience a vertical kind of division
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.020]   and that's generational gap.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.020]   And both of these divisions or separations,
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.120]   they remind us not only how broken relationship
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.480]   with one another would look like,
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.620]   but we also reminded that in the first place,
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.140]   our relationship with God was also broken.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.860]   All of these kind of broken relationships or divisions,
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.060]   it disrupts the plan or intention of God
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.340]   to bring unity among people when he first created us.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.280]   Of course, we have the good news, right?
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.480]   And if you've been following us,
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.280]   we talked about this good news a lot.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.880]   Paul beautifully explained that in Ephesians 2.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.960]   He says, Jesus broke down the walls,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.140]   the wall of hostility between two people group,
[00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.600]   like the Jews and Gentiles.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.080]   And basically he's reconciling both of them to God
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.920]   through the cross in one body.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.600]   So Jesus, we see that he has the power to remove barriers.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.400]   He first removed the spiritual barrier
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.920]   between us humans and God.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.720]   And on the cross, he didn't just do that.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.840]   He also removed the horizontal barrier
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.440]   between people groups, between cultures
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.040]   and languages and ethnicity.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.380]   And we know that, although Paul didn't write about it,
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.120]   the power of the cross actually have power
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   to remove the vertical, the generational barrier as well,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.540]   particularly that inside the body of Christ.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.040]   And you may ask, how did that happen?
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.240]   If you were around during Chinese New Year,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.480]   I was talking about another passage in the Bible,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.120]   Psalm 133, and I mentioned there's this guy,
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.600]   this German theologian, his name is Bonhoeffer.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.440]   And he explained this beautifully.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.440]   He said, this kind of unity,
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.540]   this both horizontal and vertical unity,
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.680]   it's not a human ideal.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.800]   It's not something we made up.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.280]   It's something that was made possible
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.080]   because of the cross of Jesus.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.880]   And we have to know this.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.640]   Today, I come to my friend, Derek, let's say, our new elder,
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.040]   I come to my friend, Derek,
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.160]   not just because we're both like good looking guys
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.540]   and we like each other and we have similar taste of food
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.480]   or music or whatever, but because we're both saved by Jesus.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.600]   Jesus died for him, Jesus died for me,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.880]   Jesus saved him, forgave him, Jesus saved me, forgave me.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.980]   And so today, when I built my relationship with Jesus
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.480]   and he built his relationship with Jesus,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.280]   through Jesus, we could reach each other.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.960]   That's how we build our relationship.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.240]   You know, that's why in the church, in the body of Christ,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   if we ever like said something
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.880]   that we don't like about each other,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.720]   or we wrong each other,
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.600]   Jesus' blood has covered all that.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.500]   His blood didn't just fix the relationship
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.160]   between us and God,
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.280]   Jesus' cross fixed the relationship between us
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.000]   inside his body, that or whatever separation
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.720]   that was caused by our differences in language,
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.360]   our differences in culture, our differences in ethnicity,
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.620]   Jesus has fixed all that.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.080]   But Jesus also fixed that generational gap,
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.960]   that generational barrier.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.480]   If we come to one another in Jesus,
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.720]   then we can experience true harmony,
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.840]   we can experience true relationship,
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.120]   relationship that would bless our soul,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.840]   that's so deeply, and that's what it is all about.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.240]   And we gotta know this,
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.560]   the way to show that we know the real forgiveness of Jesus,
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.200]   we know that we're forgiven by God,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.080]   is simply to walk in that kind of forgiveness,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.300]   starting to forgive one another around us.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.520]   And how do we show that we truly understand what it means
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.360]   to have a God who fully understand us and accept us?
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   It's simple, we just seek to understand
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   and seek to understand and to accept those around us,
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.760]   despite our differences.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.280]   And that's how we show I truly understand
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.560]   what God has done for me, what Jesus' cross means for me.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.600]   In the last couple of years,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.820]   we witnessed the brokenness in many relationships,
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.000]   in a city around the world,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.500]   particularly some of the intergenerational relationships.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.160]   I've heard stories, even from people in this room,
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.960]   I know how hard things have been between generations,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.840]   between even inside families.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.360]   And I know that the brokenness brings a lot of heartache,
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.800]   particularly if it's between those of us
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.400]   who should be closest to us in our family's neighborhood,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.840]   we saw that in a city in the world as well.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.680]   And I personally, no joke,
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.040]   I personally experienced some of those tensions as well,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.320]   with people that are closest to me.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.760]   But when I reflect on that, and if I'm honest,
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.840]   when I think about what happened
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.700]   in the last couple of years,
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.920]   I think sometimes my tendency
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.160]   is to only to accept those who accept
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.720]   or agree with my opinion.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.760]   Let me say that again, I realize I have this tendency
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.840]   when I'm in different relationships,
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.000]   I tend to only accept those
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.080]   who would accept or agree with me,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.680]   or accept my opinion.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.520]   And there is a problem, if this is the case in the church,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.560]   in the body of Christ,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.080]   the problem would be this kind of mentality
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.520]   that we only accept those who accept our ideas, our opinion.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.600]   If this is the case in the church,
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.040]   then the body of Christ or our unity
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.640]   can only be achieved, or will only be achieved
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.380]   by uniformity.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.740]   Only when we all like to sing the same songs,
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.640]   when we all like to read the same book,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.280]   when we all like to dress the same,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.360]   like me and Ivan, we can't dress differently,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.400]   we have to all have the same favorite color,
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.960]   same favorite outfit,
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.280]   we have to like the same instruments,
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.480]   we have to have everything the same,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.720]   everybody will have to have this uniformity
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.520]   before we can achieve unity.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.320]   If we only accept those who would accept what we like,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.400]   who would accept our opinion.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.600]   And apparently that cannot be the case in the church.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.460]   We don't stand behind this kind of unity.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.820]   If you've been here in the Vineyard long, long enough,
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.140]   you know that we champion another kind of unity
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.300]   and that's unity in diversity.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.540]   We wanna see the coming together
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.300]   of people from different languages,
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.700]   from different cultures, from different ethnicities,
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.060]   and even from different generations.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.020]   We wanna see true unity in our diversity
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.740]   because we know that Jesus
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.680]   destroyed this horizontal division between cultures
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.200]   just as he has destroyed this vertical division
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.020]   between generations.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.780]   He reconciled different ethnicities and cultures
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.780]   and he also reconciled different generations into one body.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.660]   So the body of Christ is not just multi-ethnic,
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.660]   not just multicultural, it's also multi-generational.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.580]   When the early church,
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.660]   they was trying to express this truth,
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   they use a term called communion of saints.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.820]   It carries a meaning that we have a church
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.740]   that is across time, across the present,
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.680]   the past, present, and future.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   We belong to one timeless family in Christ.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.060]   That's what communion of saints means.
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.700]   We're in the same church as with those
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.620]   who are in the earliest days,
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.820]   who have seen Jesus before,
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.820]   but we're also in the same church,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.520]   in the same church family with those who are yet to come.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.020]   And not only that, if we look at the Bible,
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.460]   we would see that God reveals himself
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.080]   as the God of the generations.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.500]   You see, generations has always been part
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.060]   of God's original plan, has always been his plan A.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.580]   I know we've read this verses here
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.060]   like maybe 10 million times,
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.580]   but I'm still going to read it again.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.620]   Genesis 128 says this,
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.780]   "God blessed them, Adam and Eve,
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.220]   who were made in his image,
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.500]   and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.300]   Fill the earth and subdue it.'"
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.900]   You see, when God created Adam and Eve,
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.420]   we heard about that, we know that God intended them,
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.860]   for them to be his co-rulers,
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.940]   his representative on this planet.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.500]   But God never intended for just the two of them,
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.940]   just Adam and Eve to do it.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.140]   He expected them to reproduce and multiply,
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.260]   make more babies in their image.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.500]   And they were made in the image of God,
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.700]   and they make more babies who just look like them.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.700]   And together, there'll be generations
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.580]   and generations of humanity walking alongside God
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.180]   to rule over this earth.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.740]   That was the original plan.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.140]   Generations has always been the original plan.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.340]   Even when a human, like after the fall,
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:27.660]   we see that this original blessing,
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.380]   God never took it away.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.620]   He's still blessing generations and generations.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.180]   And then we see when he made a covenant with Abraham,
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.060]   he didn't just make a covenant with Abraham himself.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.820]   He said, "I'm gonna make a covenant with you
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.140]   "and with your descendants,
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.740]   "the generations who will come from you."
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.980]   God made a covenant with Abraham,
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.220]   signed a contract with him,
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.100]   and that's a generational contract,
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.220]   it's a generational covenant.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:58.420]   And so when God finally revealed himself to Moses,
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.620]   he said, "I am the God of Abraham,
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.980]   "I'm the God of Isaac, I'm the God of Jacob.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.460]   "He is the God of generations."
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.340]   And this is how he choose to reveal himself
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.260]   to different people at different time.
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.740]   And we have to know that his promise,
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.060]   his covenant, his plan and his work
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.620]   doesn't just cover one generation,
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:26.340]   but it spans across many, many generations.
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.780]   But then we come across a verse in the book of Acts,
[00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.660]   which was actually a part of a sermon of Paul.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.740]   He was talking about King David
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.980]   in Acts 13, verse 36, he says this,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.740]   "Now, when David had served God's purpose
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.460]   "in his own generation, he fell asleep.
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.420]   "He was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed."
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.460]   You know, David was a wonderful man,
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.700]   he achieved a lot of things,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.100]   he united the entire nation of Israel, the 12 tribes,
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.100]   and he brought the Ark of Covenant,
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.580]   the presence of God right into Jerusalem.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.700]   He did a lot of things.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.700]   But when he wanted to build a home or a temple for God,
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.260]   God says, "No, no, no, no, no, that's not your assignment.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.900]   "That's your son's assignment.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.220]   "I intend for your son to do that.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.060]   "You only have to make the preparations,
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.700]   "but you don't have to build anything.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.680]   "That's his assignment.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.540]   "It's for the next generation, it's not for you."
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.980]   So for David in his generation,
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.260]   they still worship no matter how much they love God,
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.380]   they still worship God in that tent.
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.820]   It was for Solomon's and his generation
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.140]   that finally built that temple
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.580]   and worship God day and night,
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.700]   bring sacrifice to God in that temple.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.340]   You see, God has specific purposes for his people
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.240]   to fulfill within the context
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.280]   of their particular time and circumstances.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.680]   God's people, for example,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.840]   I know I'm oversimplifying this,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.620]   but bear with me for a moment.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.320]   I know for God's people,
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.500]   perhaps in my grandparents' generation,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.540]   I think their mission was to show the world the love of God,
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.060]   to show a war-torn world,
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.740]   a world that experienced two world wars,
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.660]   a world that was really destroyed,
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.940]   torn apart by the cruelty of war.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:21.880]   Their mission was to show this world
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.220]   what the love of God looks like,
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.260]   what hope actually looks like.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.780]   Maybe your family was destroyed,
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.420]   maybe you got separated,
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.560]   maybe your loved ones died in your arms,
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.820]   but there is still hope and you can still experience love.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.580]   I believe that's part of their mission in that generation.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.140]   And perhaps in my parents' generation,
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.760]   the church, what they had to do was to stay firm,
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.380]   stand firm in God's truth and his word,
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.500]   witnessing God's truth in a world
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.160]   that is rapidly secularizing.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.300]   When people are turning away from the Bible,
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.560]   turning away from God,
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.340]   their mission is to witness God and his truth
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.340]   and his word in such a generation.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.520]   And what about our generation, my generation?
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.620]   We've witnessed some of the craziest
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.520]   technological advancement in the last,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.620]   I don't know, how many hundred years.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.780]   First, we have computers, internet,
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.180]   and then we have iPhones,
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.860]   sorry for Android users, but I'll count you in as well.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.580]   And you have social media, and now we have AI.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.580]   It completely changed our world.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.900]   The way we talk to one another, the way we think,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.060]   the way we work, our lives are turned upside down right now.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.660]   You see the new pope that who was just recently elected,
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.500]   he chose his name Leo, he's Leo XIV.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.420]   He said part of the reason was because Leo XIII
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.900]   was the guy who was pope during the Industrial Revolution
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.280]   and he saw all the societal problems
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.860]   that the world was facing during that Industrial Revolution
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.860]   or technological advancement in that time,
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.460]   and he felt he, as the leader of the church,
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.500]   or as the church, they have to stood up
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.220]   and help the world face those problems.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.660]   And so now Leo XIV, the new pope, he said,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.060]   "I see what the world is going through right now
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.540]   "with AI, with all the technological advancement.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.600]   "I know all the ethical issues,
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.460]   "all the challenges that we're facing."
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.560]   And then by naming himself Leo XIV, he said,
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.640]   "I think the church has to stood up in such a time as this.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.520]   "Every generation has a specific purpose
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.000]   "at a specific time or specific circumstances."
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.220]   God is using his church, his people in this world,
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:42.380]   and every generation, they will have to serve God's purpose
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.940]   in their own generation.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:49.980]   We all have a small part to play in the bigger picture,
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.900]   a much bigger picture.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.900]   And different generations certainly have different parts.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.660]   Perhaps what would be helpful is to recognize the fact
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.500]   or manage our own expectations
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.220]   so that we were not hoping others to do our parts
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.560]   or expecting them to do it the way we do.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.480]   I hope you get what I mean.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.560]   Like as the church, I hope we're here together,
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.900]   we have different generations gathered around here
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.460]   that we know every generation,
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.540]   they may have their own assignments
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.860]   and their purpose, and perhaps we're not trying
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.480]   to expect different generations
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.720]   to do things exactly the same.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.700]   I think that's where we can start
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.540]   when we talk about how generations can come together.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.860]   And across different generations,
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.860]   as we're playing these different parts,
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:43.460]   as we're shaped by different experience,
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.780]   and we know that we're quite likely
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.160]   we would do things differently,
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.940]   we even say things differently.
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.860]   We say different words when I try to tell you I'm hungry,
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.420]   like my stomach is Ohio, is that what you mean?
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.420]   I can't even remember that,
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.020]   but we do think, we say things differently,
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.060]   we do things differently, and we just have to accept that.
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.200]   It's okay to be different.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.060]   We talk about unity and diversity, right?
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.620]   And I think sometimes I see in the global church
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.420]   or just churches in a city,
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.160]   sometimes we think we must do things the same way
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.440]   we have been doing things like that.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.100]   We should continue to do things that way.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.300]   And I also see that some emerging generations,
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.620]   they say this is the way, this is the new way,
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.680]   and this is the only way to do things.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.280]   Can I say both are correct and both are wrong.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.700]   We have different purposes,
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.660]   we serve different generations,
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.660]   we use different methods,
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.260]   and we can do it differently,
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.200]   and still we're part of the same big picture here.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.520]   And again, if we only accept those who are accept
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.600]   or agree with our opinions,
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.720]   our way of doing things, our standard of good and bad,
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.220]   what sound nice, what look nice or bad,
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.900]   and if we're like that,
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.880]   we're saying that unity can only be achieved by uniformity.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.640]   If we're trying to make everybody join
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.780]   just only one same event at a particular time,
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.520]   and that's the only way,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.500]   that's how our church would do things,
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.460]   and we're trying to say uniformity
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.780]   is the only way to achieve unity.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.360]   But we can celebrate our differences
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.460]   because that does not undermine the work of Jesus
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.740]   that he has accomplished on the cross.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:31.880]   Let me say that again.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.380]   When we do things differently,
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.380]   when we have different expressions here,
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.020]   that does not undermine the work of the cross
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.760]   that Jesus has accomplished.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.620]   In fact, when we can do things differently
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.500]   and we can accept that,
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.180]   that's the way to show we are really together,
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.140]   and we really accept one another.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.100]   And we're not pursuing unity and uniformity.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.940]   Instead, let me read from Ephesians 4
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.900]   where Paul shares about the goal of our unity.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.560]   Let me read this.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.980]   So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets,
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.720]   the evangelists, the pastors and teachers
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.400]   to equip his people for works of service
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.980]   so that the body of Christ may be built up
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.460]   until we all reach unity in the faith
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.540]   and in the knowledge of the Son of God
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.780]   and become mature,
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.620]   attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.940]   So Jesus has given us different gifts through his spirit
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.620]   so that his body, like the church,
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.860]   the multi-ethnic, multi-generational body of Christ
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.860]   can be built up until we all reach unity in the faith
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.840]   and in the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.040]   And this is the first thing that all generation
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.320]   of God's people will have in common,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.480]   the same quality of faith and relationship with Jesus.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.280]   If we really wanna be united, you know what?
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.960]   We're supposed to be united in our faith.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.240]   We're supposed to have the same kind of faith,
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.200]   same quality of faith that we share with Jesus,
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.520]   or in Jesus.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.140]   And that's why sometimes I really like listening to stories.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.900]   I remember there were times like when I was going through
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.980]   a crisis on my own, or I could be a little bit more specific,
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.900]   maybe a financial crisis on my own,
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.900]   and I hear people talking about
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.860]   how they've been through a journey like that,
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:25.140]   that someone in his ministry, he left full-time ministry
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.660]   and he had no income at all for an extended time
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.500]   and he was really struggling.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.540]   And then somehow God just met his need in the end.
[00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.840]   And I met this guy and he was just,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.000]   this is the first time we met,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.560]   like he just started sharing that story.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.220]   He didn't know about my situation,
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.840]   but as he was sharing that story,
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.020]   I felt this kind of faith starting to arise in me,
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.520]   that at first I look at what I do not have,
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.320]   I look at my fears, but then as he was sharing,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.240]   as he was sharing his story of faith with me,
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.240]   I see that my faith level rise inside of me.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.980]   I think my faith level is rising
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.880]   to a little bit more closer to him.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.120]   I'm reaching a little bit more closer to unity
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.640]   in my faith with my brother in Christ.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:14.600]   We're supposed to be united in our faith
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.560]   and our knowledge of Jesus.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:17.840]   You know, if you really,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.840]   if we really have the same kind of faith
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.780]   and we really know Jesus so well,
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.080]   it's hard not to be united actually.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.800]   And then after that, Paul says, he talks about maturity.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.580]   And we've talked a lot about this here,
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.460]   maturity, the fullness of Christ.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.380]   We talk about this, right?
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.440]   Maturity doesn't just come with age.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.580]   You know, if you are young and you lie a lot,
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.300]   you're a young liar.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.740]   If you are old and you still lie a lot,
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.420]   you're an old liar.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.540]   And an old liar and a young liar,
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.380]   it doesn't matter, you're still a liar.
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.300]   I mean, you're still struggling
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.840]   with not being able to tell the truth.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.400]   So what I mean is you can grow old.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.440]   Growing old is inevitable.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.840]   I believe I've preached this here,
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.940]   but growing up is always optional.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.600]   So we can keep growing older and older and older,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.720]   but we never mature.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.440]   That is completely possible.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.520]   I'm sure there are a lot of people around us
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.400]   that would prove this right.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.800]   I'm not here to say anything against them.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.700]   I'm just saying that this, it's reality.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.700]   We grow old, we all do, but we don't always grow up.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.940]   We don't always mature.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:39.100]   But if we really mature in a personal relationship
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.300]   with Christ by accepting his words
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.780]   as the ultimate authority of our lives,
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.340]   as we start to follow him,
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.500]   as we give our lives to follow Jesus,
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.700]   accept, be obedient to his word,
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.700]   and you will start to see this kind of maturity
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.800]   growing in you because if you really follow Jesus,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.260]   you will start to put others before yourselves,
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.560]   and you will start to take up responsibilities,
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.000]   and you will start to be sacrificial in your life,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.880]   and you will be more and more and more like him,
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   and you will have the fullness of Christ in you.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.920]   And when you have the fullness of Christ in you,
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.000]   and I'm getting there, I'm getting more mature
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.660]   and having more of Christ's fullness in me,
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.500]   there, that's where we unite.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.060]   That's where unity lies.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.200]   I'm telling you, if we are all getting more like Jesus,
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.720]   growing to be more like him,
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.060]   unity is just a byproduct.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.120]   It will happen naturally.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.480]   When we all get there to be like Jesus,
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.560]   more like him, you will find unity is natural.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.520]   That's where we're called to.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.560]   Paul says, you know what?
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.640]   This, we're supposed to be united in our faith,
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.840]   in our relationship with him,
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.160]   with our knowledge in him,
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.320]   and in our maturity, becoming more like him.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.840]   God doesn't need us to be united in a way
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.880]   that we all talk the same, we wear the same clothes,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.580]   we speak the same language,
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.640]   or we sing or like the same worship song.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.800]   God doesn't need that.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.560]   He wants us to be united in our maturity,
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.280]   in our obedience to his word, and in our Christ-likeness.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.040]   He wants us all to look like Jesus.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.120]   He wants every single generation in the body of Christ
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.320]   to look like Jesus, to speak like Jesus,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.560]   to walk like Jesus, so that we can represent Jesus well
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.840]   to our generation, so that every single generation
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.480]   on this planet could have a taste of who Jesus is.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.640]   That's how our unity works.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.760]   God is at work in every generation.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.080]   We all get to be a part of that work,
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.640]   and serve God's purpose in our generation.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.000]   But you may wonder,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.760]   oh, there are different generations here overlapping.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.840]   You know, we have the slightly more mature,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.080]   slightly more like older ones,
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.280]   we have the slightly more younger ones.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.800]   We're all like here, we're different,
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.080]   but we're all here.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.040]   Does that mean we'll just do our own thing, you know?
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.560]   Never bother with one another,
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.160]   just, you know, just, in Cantonese,
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.880]   we call it gi gi gu gi gi, like, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.680]   You just, basically, you just do your own thing.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.960]   Like, don't bother me.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.400]   Do we do that?
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.520]   Of course not, right?
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.480]   Otherwise, we wouldn't write this sermon series,
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.520]   we don't preach this.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.840]   But generations are not meant to work or walk alone.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.040]   We are created to walk together, and build each other up.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.840]   Surely, a larger part of that responsibility,
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.200]   when it comes to, like, building generations,
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.960]   coming together, building each other up,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.760]   of course, sometimes that responsibility
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   may lie a little bit more on the older generation,
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.880]   'cause they're further down the road,
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:44.000]   they probably have experienced God a bit more.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.440]   They have tasted the goodness of God,
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   they have followed Him,
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.480]   they have experienced Him a little bit more,
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.600]   and there's something you can actually share
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.280]   with the younger generation.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.680]   And that's what we do, right?
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.920]   We try to share with them what we have experienced
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.040]   in our journey with God.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.440]   But let me highlight some scriptures here.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.440]   In Psalm 145, verse four, it says,
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.600]   "One generation commands your works to another.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.760]   "They tell of your mighty acts."
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.160]   You see, it's a lot of storytelling,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.560]   talking about what God has done.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.680]   And before we moved into this building,
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.840]   one of the last sermons we preached in EIS
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.960]   was on this passage in Deuteronomy 6.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.680]   It says this, "When your sons ask you in time to come,"
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.640]   like, why are we following all these,
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.400]   like, commandments and laws?
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.160]   Why are we doing this?
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.800]   And God asks the people of Israel to tell the story again,
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.120]   to tell the story of Exodus,
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.360]   to tell them what God has done, has achieved in their lives,
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.160]   tell them how loving our God is,
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.240]   tell them how powerful our God is.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.480]   It's through our storytelling
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.640]   that we're trying to let the next generation know who He is,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.880]   what He has done, and how He will do it,
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.040]   and how much He loves us.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.720]   You see, the Bible, we call the first five books,
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.800]   like the Torah, means the law,
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.160]   but the Bible, in the Old Testament,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.680]   the author chose, or God chose to reveal His law
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.280]   to His people in stories.
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.400]   All these laws are embedded in narratives, in stories,
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.680]   because God doesn't want to take the law out of the story.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.840]   He wants to tell you, He wants you to know
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.120]   when He asks you to do something,
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.200]   He wants you to know what He has done before.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.080]   He wants you to know who He is.
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.520]   And so, if you are the slightly older generation,
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.600]   one of the things you can do is grab someone younger,
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.080]   tell some stories.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.680]   Of course, you can tell him, you know,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.200]   what you think it's appropriate to do,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.600]   what you think will be good for that person,
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.360]   but tell him some stories, share your life.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.080]   We're not here, you know, we're not school
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.560]   just telling people principles and rules and all that.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.160]   We're communicating our life stories.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.120]   That's how life can impact another life.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:55.600]   We're here to share stories, and if you are,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.000]   you have the privilege of listening to some stories
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   of someone else, this is what I would suggest you to do.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.360]   You see, I did spend some money to learn to be a coach.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.280]   I learned coaching.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.880]   Coaching is all about asking questions,
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.520]   and I find it incredibly useful.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.320]   Every Wednesday before our Alpha session,
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.360]   I basically, every Wednesday I go through tons of questions
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.320]   with my hosts and helpers.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.640]   Asking questions, it's super beneficial.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.560]   If you're hearing a question, hearing a story,
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.280]   one of the questions you can ask is,
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.440]   so, would you like to tell me, or could you tell me
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.120]   what makes you think that, or what's the reason
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.520]   behind your certain decision, this certain thing,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.960]   this certain thought, or you said this, you did this,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.160]   what was the reason behind?
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.320]   And one of the other questions that would be super helpful
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.800]   if you want to learn about someone's story is that,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.680]   so, in this event, or in this incident, what did you learn?
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.200]   What did you learn about God?
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.000]   What did you learn about yourself?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.280]   And I can't tell you how much I gain from being in rooms
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   with more mature people, and I just listen to their stories
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.480]   and I start asking these questions.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.720]   I can't tell you how much I've learned,
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.760]   I've gained from those conversations.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.120]   Generations were supposed to tell each other,
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.520]   hey, communicate with one another, saying,
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.040]   hey, this is what God has done before.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.240]   So, if you follow him, you can expect you'll experience that.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.600]   But let me also highlight some stories from the Bible
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   where we have a young Samuel, God used a young Samuel
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.280]   to speak to an old Eli.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:40.480]   God also used a young King Josiah to lead an entire nation.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:44.120]   It's totally possible for God to use younger generations,
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.720]   to use younger people to speak into older people's life.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.480]   The question is, am I ready?
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.760]   I'm just looking.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.440]   You know, every time, right, my daughter is,
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.200]   especially Megan, now she's in a stage
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.840]   where she likes to correct people.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.800]   Sometimes it's just small things like,
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.720]   daddy, you shouldn't put your cup here,
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.320]   you shouldn't put your pens here,
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.800]   you shouldn't put your, I try to remind myself,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.240]   I must learn to listen.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.480]   It's not because that I'm allowing her to be bossy,
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.040]   but I know that God will surely speak to me
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.960]   through my daughters.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.640]   I need to build a habit of listening
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.360]   to the next generation as I grow.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   That's super important in our lives.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.040]   I think if we could do that,
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.000]   we will be the one who benefit from it as well.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And this is where I'll come back to Paul's letter.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.880]   You see, Samuel could minister to Eli,
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.280]   could speak to him because the Holy Spirit was on him
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.600]   and he had a gift of, he has a prophetic gift,
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.920]   and he was operating in the gifts of the Spirit.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.760]   So let's go back to, yes, thank you.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.840]   Christ himself gave the apostles,
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.480]   the context was saying Christ has given the church
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.480]   a lot of gifts.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.000]   And these are some of the gifts,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.320]   apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers,
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.040]   these are spiritual gifts.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.360]   These are not just roles to be filled with a job,
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.640]   these are spiritual gifts and offices as well.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.200]   And younger generation,
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.440]   although they may not be experienced,
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.880]   although they may not be as mature,
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.920]   but they could still operate in these kind of gifts.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.480]   And this is how they could also come alongside
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.560]   the older generation and bless them.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.560]   And so we see we have a lot here to bless each other, church.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.680]   Whether you have more experience in your walk with God
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.520]   or God has given you spiritual gifts to bless his people,
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.560]   there's so many ways that we can walk together
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.560]   that we can bless one another.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:47.480]   And that's why we, as generations,
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.520]   we're supposed to be walking, journeying,
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.880]   moving forward together.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.800]   And that's the heart of this church.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.440]   In the last two years,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.160]   we've been building a community that's cross-cultural,
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.720]   that's cross ethnicity.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.200]   We've been building a community like that.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.080]   We have different ethnicity, languages,
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.760]   cultures represented here.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.240]   But now you know the vision of the church this year.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.920]   We want to see generations being here as well.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.840]   But generations,
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.360]   I know I'm not just talking about the younger ones,
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.840]   of course, that's what's happening this afternoon.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.360]   But I'm sure if anyone wants to bring
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.520]   a grandpa and grandma here,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.040]   we would love that as well.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.160]   Like we want all generations being represented in this body
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.000]   because that's what Jesus had made possible.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.520]   This is what he died for,
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.280]   for a church that's like this,
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.680]   cross-cultural, ethnicity and language,
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.880]   and also multi-generational.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.640]   This is the kind of church
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.240]   that God has called the Vineyard Long to be.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.960]   And this is how we're gonna relate to one another.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.240]   We're going to serve each other with our experience,
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.120]   our walk with God, with what God has taught us.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.680]   We're also gonna serve each other
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.600]   with the gifts that God has given us.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.680]   Can I get an amen for that?
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.080]   Okay, since you said amen,
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.760]   I'm gonna ask you to do something.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.480]   The worship team is gonna come back up,
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.920]   and they're gonna play some music in the background.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.200]   As a response to the word today,
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.560]   not to me, but to what you have heard from God,
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.640]   I invite you to look around this room,
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.480]   find someone you would think he or she
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.240]   is from a different generation.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.760]   I'll leave that to you.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.200]   Yeah, I'm not good at that.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   You all look 18 to me here, or 20, all right.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.800]   I don't know, but I'll let you do it.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.640]   Find someone you know there from a different generation.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.720]   Just pray for one another, bless each other.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.920]   And if you could, stay for the last bring your own lunch
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.240]   and share stories, that would be awesome.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.920]   Shall we just find someone and pray for each other
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.960]   as we close right now?
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.440]   Let's do that.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.280]   I love you all.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.360]   Let me, yeah, Father, we're called
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.680]   to be this multi-generational, multi-ethnic,
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.480]   multi-cultural church, and Father, we love that.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.480]   We love you.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.040]   Bless the time, bless the relationships here,
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.920]   bless the connections in Jesus' name.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.960]   Go ahead, church.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
