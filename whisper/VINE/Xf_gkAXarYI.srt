1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Well, it's the beginning of 2025.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 What I want to do is first, actually do a little review of 2024 because God has been

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 amazing.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,060
 He's been so faithful and so good to us.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,160
 And then I'll have a word for us for 2025.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,200
 Now in 2024, we had our one year birthday celebration as a church.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
 That was a big deal.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,840
 So praise God for that.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,480
 Yes, very, very subtle.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,520
 We also established a lot of partnerships and collaborations.

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,760
 So we had YOM Shanti as one of our mission partners.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,060
 We collaborated with Branches of Hope, which also works with refugees and asylum seekers,

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,880
 with Young Lives, which works with teen moms.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,120
 We've partnered with Oasis Counseling and Psychotherapy Center and some of our parenting

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,560
 workshops and also through counseling.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,900
 And then we also partnered with a Chinese primary YMCA school in Tinchoy Y, where several

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,240
 of our Cantonese brothers and sisters, they go twice a week teaching three different classes.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,480
 And so these are ways that we've been getting involved in community and just serving and

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,720
 loving those around us.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,440
 Now another thing that I'm really excited about is that we started a youth group in

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,600
 August 2024.

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,480
 And so I already see some of the volunteers sitting here.

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,120
 They're amazing.

24
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 And this year, or towards the end of the year, I also asked Francesca and Andrew to actually

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,000
 lead the youth group.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,920
 And so I'm really excited about what God's going to do in 2025 in the youth group.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,560
 I already saw even just in the month or so that they led it, the energy.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,840
 And so I'm excited about what's ahead.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,160
 I also want to ask you church to pray for them and pray for our youth ministry.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,480
 So we're really excited about what God is doing there.

31
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,640
 Then at the beginning of 2024, we shared every year we actually need to grow in giving to

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,080
 cover our expenses because one child is supporting us.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,360
 And so last year, we were responsible for 20% of our expenses, but we said we need to

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,520
 move towards 40% because guess what?

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,040
 Right now we need to cover 40% of our expenses.

36
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,280
 And we were able to do that.

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,000
 So praise God for his financial provision for us.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,920
 And thank you for your generosity and giving.

39
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,440
 And then we've also experienced incredible growth as a church family.

40
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,880
 We started off last year with 166 adults and 31 children.

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,840
 And in November, we were 251 adults on average between our two services and 61 children.

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,720
 So God also has done some incredible work there.

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,680
 Yes, praise God.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,800
 And then most importantly, and that's sometimes not that easy to capture is that people have

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,560
 come to faith.

46
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,840
 People have grown in faith, have moved from anxiety and fear to faith and trust and have

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,440
 experienced the healing of Jesus through Alpha, through our Sunday services, through community

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,000
 groups, through in K4C our children have experienced as well.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And so I just wanted to take the beginning of this year to actually start off with just

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,800
 giving God thanks and praising him for the work that he's done.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,440
 So praise God.

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,800
 And I also want to say thank you to you because the way that God works is that he works through

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,140
 his church.

54
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,140
 He works through his people.

55
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,600
 And what it actually takes is that people are willing to offer up their time, their

56
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,480
 talents, their gifts to serve him both inside and outside the church to do his work, to

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,040
 partner in his mission.

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,400
 And you guys have done that.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,380
 And so thank you for faithfully serving as well.

60
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,800
 So incredible.

61
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,400
 And right now I'm excited to talk to you about 2025.

62
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,480
 And so today we're kicking off a new sermon series that we've entitled Bold in Prayer.

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,440
 So at the beginning of the year, we want to come boldly before God in prayer.

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,320
 There's four different prayers we're going to look at from Old Testament, New Testament.

65
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,520
 And I believe those four areas are areas where God wants to do some work in our heart at

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,320
 the beginning of the year to prepare us for what he has for us in 2025.

67
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,160
 So I'm really excited about that.

68
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,080
 Now we purposefully overlap that with the fasting season.

69
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,480
 And I really do want you to join us in that.

70
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,960
 So do have a look, do decide on what you're going to fast and what personal things you're

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
 going to bring before God.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,600
 Because I believe that when we come to him in prayer, when we come to him in fasting,

73
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
 you got meets us.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,220
 You know, he works.

75
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,040
 And so she would come expectantly as a church, expecting him to move us into his purposes

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,520
 and his destiny and to provide for us what we need in 2025.

77
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,740
 So please do join us for that.

78
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,440
 But now I want to share with you the word that God has impressed on my heart for us

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,360
 here at the beginning of the year, which I think will be a theme that will run through

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
 all of the year.

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
 And it started with me walking home from church.

82
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,400
 I was walking home from church.

83
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,480
 I came, I was just had just learned the song Holy forever.

84
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,920
 I didn't know it before.

85
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,480
 So I'm worshiping Holy forever found on Spotify and put it on repeat.

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,520
 And off I went on my walk back home.

87
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,200
 And so I came to a park and I suddenly sense God asking me to get on my knees and worship

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
 him.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,040
 I was like, why?

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,900
 There's like, there's like people walking here all over the place.

91
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,920
 Why should I get on my knees and worship you?

92
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,200
 What's what's it about this?

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,520
 And I didn't do it.

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
 So I kept walking.

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,480
 And then I even had a stronger sense that God was asking me to get on my knees and to

96
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,660
 worship him.

97
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:13,600
 So I got on my knees, people walking past me and I worship God in the street until I

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,960
 felt a release is like, okay, I can get up now.

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
 And as I was walking the remainder of time, I was just walking home.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,280
 I was like, what was that all about?

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
 Like why?

102
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,280
 Why did I need to get on my knees and worship God in this place?

103
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,200
 Is there something special about this park?

104
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,800
 Is it something about that Jesus doesn't want us to just focus or want me to focus on just

105
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,320
 doing stuff inside this building?

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,040
 But he's telling me he's at work out in the streets.

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,980
 Like what is it?

108
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,680
 So I was wondering and I'm just walking home.

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
 I was like, this is kind of bizarre.

110
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,840
 And by the way, this is not my normal experience.

111
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,520
 I don't constantly have these experience where I feel God speak to me to get down on my knees

112
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,120
 and worship him or something like that.

113
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,680
 Now I also sensed that God was asking me to take a group of people there to worship and

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,180
 to pray.

115
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,880
 Now I have to admit this also took me a very long time to do.

116
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,240
 But in December, fast forward to December, we finally went there.

117
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,520
 So I invited, I asked Matthias to help me organize it.

118
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,760
 And so I went with Matthias and some of you and we went to this park and we worshiped

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,960
 God in Cantonese and of course with Holy Forever since that was the song where I felt led to

120
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
 worship.

121
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
 I want to show you something.

122
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,360
 I want to show you a photo.

123
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,440
 So as we were worshiping and singing Holy Forever, suddenly we had people singing with

124
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
 us and worshiping with us.

125
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,620
 And it was a group that was like 50 meters or a hundred meters away from us was a group

126
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,240
 of Filipino ladies that have their Bible study there.

127
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,320
 And so then we walked over like, let's do this again.

128
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
 Let's do this the right way.

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,600
 So we worship God saying Holy Forever.

130
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,480
 And you know, there's something, there's something powerful of just like, I have never met these

131
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,120
 ladies before, but right away, you know, there's a bond between believers.

132
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,640
 And it was so beautiful.

133
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,660
 And I think we, all of us who went, and I see some of you here, you know, we were so

134
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,720
 encouraged by that.

135
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,480
 And then we prayed, we prayed for them.

136
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
 They prayed for us.

137
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,080
 We also went on a prayer walk.

138
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,920
 And I, as we were leaving to go to another park to do some outreach, I, there was this

139
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,760
 guy that I had noticed.

140
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,920
 He was sitting there the whole time.

141
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,760
 He's watching us.

142
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,120
 So I go to the, I decided, Jess, Matthias' wife had baked some cookies.

143
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,760
 So I brought him some cookies, gave him some cookies.

144
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,520
 I wanted to give him a flyer to come to church.

145
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,960
 He didn't want the flyer.

146
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,400
 So then I talked to him for like half an hour about God.

147
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,000
 And he's like, where is your God?

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Show me your God.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Introduce me to him.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,400
 I was like, oh, it's not that easy that, you know, so just, he wanted a physical introduction.

151
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:07,960
 And so as we're talking, he's telling me that he is in charge of this park.

152
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,720
 So what does that mean?

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,400
 You're in charge of this park.

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
 And so then he tells me more about what he does.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,160
 And I was like, ooh.

156
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,460
 So it's actually quite dark and it's illegal.

157
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,640
 And so what we kept talking about God, and I wish I could tell you that at the end, you

158
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,320
 know, he gave his life to Jesus right there and then it hasn't happened yet.

159
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,400
 But I didn't leave him with a challenge.

160
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,600
 I said, you know, you asked me to, where is your God?

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,320
 I tell you, if you pray, if you say Jesus, reveal yourself, show yourself to me, that

162
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,800
 Jesus will show himself to him.

163
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
 And so that's what I left him with.

164
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:59,200
 Now stepping back from all of this, after some reflection, I really sensed that this

165
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,040
 experience that God took me through was actually something where he wanted me, where he was

166
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,160
 speaking to me about something for all of us.

167
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:16,520
 And it's that this year God wants us to see the people around us with the eyes of Jesus.

168
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:24,840
 In 2025, he is sending us out, leading us out into our neighborhoods, into our workplace,

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,640
 into our families.

170
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:33,080
 And he's going to highlight people to us that he wants us to care for, that he wants us

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:40,920
 to love and serve, and that he wants us to share the gospel message with.

172
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,400
 But the question is, how do we get started?

173
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,920
 You know, we're here at the beginning of the year.

174
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
 What do we do?

175
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:59,160
 How can we be filled with the compassion of Jesus and moved to care for those around us

176
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,800
 and share the gospel message with those around us?

177
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,240
 You know, how can we make ourselves available to that and get actually going and not just

178
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,800
 talk about it?

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,520
 So that's what I want to explore with you today through this message.

180
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,720
 We're going to go to the gospel of Matthew, to chapter 9.

181
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,040
 The disciples, they've been, to give you a little bit of context, they've been watching

182
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,240
 Jesus teach, they've been observing him ministering to people, healing the sick, driving out demons,

183
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,480
 proclaiming the kingdom.

184
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,680
 And then at the end of chapter 9, the part we're going to look at, there's a transition

185
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,880
 that takes place that I believe is significant for us because I believe this is a transition

186
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,660
 that this year in God's timing, he wants to lead us through.

187
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,440
 And so let me read this passage to you.

188
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
 Matthew 9, starting verse 35, it says this.

189
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,840
 Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming

190
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,160
 the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.

191
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:06,720
 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless

192
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,440
 like sheep without a shepherd.

193
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,000
 Then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,280
 Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out his workers, therefore, into the harvest field.

195
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:30,440
 And Jesus called his 12 disciples to him and he gave them authority to drive out impure

196
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,600
 spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.

197
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,200
 And then these are the names of the 12 apostles.

198
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,000
 First Simon, who's called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James, son of Zebedee, and his brother

199
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,480
 John, Philip, Bartholomew.

200
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,600
 That one I always have to look up how to say that one.

201
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,840
 Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector, James, son of Aphias, and Thaddeus, Simon the zealot,

202
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,000
 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,560
 And these 12 Jesus sent out.

204
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,800
 So there's two things right up front that I think are significant for us as we want

205
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,720
 to open our lives to be filled, to be let out in the compassion of Jesus to those around

206
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,560
 us.

207
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,200
 And that is that Jesus wants to give us eyes to see others with his eyes, with the eyes

208
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,840
 of Jesus.

209
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:31,200
 And to give us the heart of Jesus for those around us.

210
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,320
 So let me look at verse 36 with you.

211
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,560
 It says this, "When he," so Jesus, "saw the crowd, he had compassion on them, because

212
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,760
 they were harassed, they were helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."

213
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,200
 And Jesus, he uses a metaphor that was quite well known to his contemporaries.

214
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,760
 It was one that you find throughout the Bible of sheep and shepherd Israel.

215
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,080
 The people are the sheep, the shepherds are the leaders.

216
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,440
 And I want to take you to the key, one key passage that I believe is a background to

217
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
 what Jesus is observing here.

218
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,600
 And that's in Ezekiel, the prophet Ezekiel.

219
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,520
 He's been given a word that he then declares to Israel and to the leadership.

220
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,640
 And so let me take you to Ezekiel 34.

221
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,440
 We're starting in verse two.

222
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,960
 It says this, "Woe to you, shepherds of Israel, who only take care of yourselves.

223
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,240
 Should not shepherds take care of the flock?

224
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,640
 You eat the curds, close yourself with the wool, and slaughter the choice animals.

225
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,280
 But you do not take care of the flock.

226
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:41,040
 You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured.

227
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,680
 You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost.

228
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,520
 You have ruled over them harshly and brutally.

229
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,680
 So they were scattered because there was no shepherd.

230
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,520
 And when they were scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.

231
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,760
 My sheep wandered all over the mountains and every high hill.

232
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:11,200
 They scattered them over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them."

233
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
 Wow.

234
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:20,080
 You know, those are quite some strong words, but they really reveal the heart of God for

235
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 us.

236
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:28,560
 You know, "You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured."

237
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,680
 You know, as a church, we're actually meant to pastor people.

238
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,960
 It's not just a pastor who pastors people.

239
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,400
 We're meant to pastor and shepherd people around us.

240
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 It's actually the job of the church.

241
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,520
 The pastor, the wounded, the hurting, the sick, the lost.

242
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,720
 And Jesus is saying, when he observed the crowds, when he has gone through all the towns,

243
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,900
 that this is happening again.

244
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:07,000
 That people are harassed, they are helpless, they lack leadership, they're vulnerable,

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,600
 there is pain, there is suffering, there is lostness.

246
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,720
 And that's what Jesus sees when he looks on the crowd.

247
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,280
 I believe one thing that's significant for us is that there's also a spiritual seeing.

248
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,320
 It's not just seeing physically what's happening.

249
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,560
 Now, of course, that's also part of it, and that is also important.

250
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,560
 But Jesus also sees the spiritual condition that people are in.

251
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,960
 And he wants us to be people who see with those same eyes those around us.

252
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,040
 He wants to open our eyes this year, to awaken, to not just be...

253
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,000
 I've walked that stretch in Yulong a million times, not a million times, a lot of times,

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 be accurate.

255
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,920
 But I never noticed the people in the park.

256
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,120
 And he wants to highlight people to us who are suffering, who are in pain, who are struggling,

257
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,720
 who are lost.

258
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,220
 That really is a start for the work that God wants to do in our hearts.

259
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,800
 He wants to give us eyes to see.

260
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
 That's the beginning point.

261
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,240
 And what we need to be open for that.

262
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,040
 So then also in verse 36, Jesus, we're told that he had compassion on them.

263
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:39,040
 It's that seeing that then moves to compassion.

264
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,120
 And having compassion is different than having pity.

265
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,840
 Pity is like, "Oh, I'm sorry for you."

266
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,720
 And you walk on.

267
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:51,440
 But having compassion means that you do not let you pass by what's going on.

268
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,320
 It means entering the suffering and the pain and the struggles of those around us.

269
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,000
 And it means getting involved and doing something about it.

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,720
 That's what compassion is.

271
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,320
 And Jesus allows himself to be filled with compassion.

272
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,340
 He doesn't let the struggles and the pain and the suffering of the people just pass

273
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
 him by.

274
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:30,200
 But he allows himself to be impacted by those who are hurting, those who are lost.

275
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,760
 So Jesus gets involved.

276
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,640
 And that's what you've been reading in the Gospel of Matthew in chapter, especially eight

277
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,040
 and nine, right before this.

278
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,000
 Jesus gets involved with people's physical pain, so he heals people.

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,760
 Jesus gets involved with people's emotional pain.

280
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:51,680
 He takes away shame and just brings healing to that and restores people and gives them

281
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,800
 dignity where dignity has been lost.

282
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:03,920
 Jesus gets involved with our spiritual lostness, restores lost sheep back to the sheepfold,

283
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,600
 meaning he brings lost people back to a relationship with the Father and restores them.

284
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,160
 And I love in the Gospel of John, Jesus says, "I am the good shepherd, and the good shepherd

285
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
 lays down his life for the sheep."

286
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:29,240
 Now, I don't know a deeper way of getting involved than laying down your life, self-giving

287
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:37,240
 love so that people can be restored back to the Father.

288
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:44,640
 And he wants us, his people, to be people who practice the same self-giving love, who

289
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,480
 be people who are filled with compassion, with the heart of God, moved by love, to not

290
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,560
 step away from people's pain and problems, which a lot of times you don't want to get

291
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
 involved, let's be honest.

292
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,920
 It's like, "Oh, there's pain, let me go a different direction.

293
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,240
 I don't want to deal with whatever this person's going through.

294
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,120
 I don't want to get involved."

295
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,560
 And I'm not saying that we are meant to be involved in everyone, every single person's

296
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,520
 pain, but it will be people's pain and people who are struggling that Jesus wants you to

297
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,320
 be involved in.

298
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,560
 And so the question is, are we available for that?

299
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,600
 Are we willing to go there?

300
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
 So Jesus, he does not stay away from our problems and pain, but he draws near to us, and he

301
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,640
 wants us to be people who draw near to others.

302
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,640
 And I think this is important for some of us here this morning as well, because actually

303
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,080
 some of us are struggling.

304
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,860
 Some of us are in pain.

305
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,920
 Some of us are hurting.

306
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:50,120
 And you need to know today that Jesus sees you, that he's filled with compassion for

307
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,480
 what is going on, that he's not running away from you like maybe other people in your life

308
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:03,360
 have been doing, but that he is drawing near to you, that he has the power to help you,

309
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,000
 to meet you, to provide you, to get you through.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,200
 And I believe that some of us need to hear this here this morning that are struggling

311
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,880
 and that are hurting.

312
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,200
 And he wants us also to come around those who are hurting and struggling here.

313
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,600
 But Jesus also has compassion for the guy in the park who's doing things that are destroying

314
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,040
 people's lives.

315
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,320
 He's not contributing to flourishing a life, but Jesus has compassion for that person as

316
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,560
 well because he sees his spiritual lostness.

317
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,960
 And he wants that person to also be restored back to the Father for his life to be turned

318
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,480
 around, that instead of bringing people down and destroying people's lives, that this person

319
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 becomes a person who builds people up, who contributes to the good, and who finds life

320
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,560
 in Jesus, forgiveness, and healing, and restoration.

321
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:12,640
 And I just wonder, are we a church who wants people like that to come into our service?

322
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,280
 I think that's a real question.

323
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,120
 But the heart of the Father longs for the lost sheep, for those that are hurting, those

324
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,320
 that are in pain, to be restored, and he wants us as people to be filled with compassion,

325
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,720
 to move out, and to express his love, his care, share his good news with those around

326
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,040
 us.

327
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:46,440
 So who do you see being harassed and helpless?

328
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:56,560
 Who is the Spirit of God stirring compassion for in your heart?

329
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:06,600
 Who does Jesus want you to see and be filled with compassion for in 2025?

330
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,600
 Now I notice this is quite heavy, right, because there is a lot of needs.

331
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 There's a lot of pain.

332
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
 There are a lot of people that are lost.

333
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,240
 There's a lot of people that are hurting.

334
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,840
 And it's really overwhelming.

335
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,240
 But I love that Jesus tells us right away what to do about that.

336
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,520
 And that we see in verse 37 through 38, so let's look at that.

337
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,820
 Jesus says there, "Then he said to the disciples, 'The harvest is plentiful, but the workers

338
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,820
 are few.

339
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,720
 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out his workers into the harvest field.'"

340
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,400
 And I love this.

341
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,080
 Jesus acknowledges this.

342
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,520
 Yes, the harvest is plentiful.

343
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,080
 There are people with needs who are ready to step into the kingdom, but there's a problem

344
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,760
 that the workers are few.

345
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:58,160
 But in the face of these overwhelming challenges and this lack of resources and lack of workers,

346
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,800
 come and pray to the Lord of the harvest, who has the ability to send out workers into

347
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,280
 his harvest field.

348
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:13,880
 And it's prayer that propels us forward in a powerful way to the needs that we see around

349
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
 us.

350
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,600
 It's the move of the Holy Spirit.

351
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,800
 Now as a pastor, honestly, my heart is like, I wish I could force us all to go and do this.

352
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 I can't.

353
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 And it wouldn't be good.

354
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,080
 It would actually be bad if I tried to do this.

355
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,760
 But it's the Spirit of God moving and stirring in our hearts, moving us into compassion,

356
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:42,520
 giving us eyes to see that sends us out into your workplaces, into your neighborhoods,

357
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:52,800
 into your families to care, to bring his love to bear, and to share the gospel message.

358
00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:00,080
 Now what I find very significant is that besides the Lord's prayer, this is actually the only

359
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,080
 time where Jesus tells us specifically what to pray for.

360
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,760
 I think this is super significant, that he really is giving his church a word on how

361
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,720
 to pray.

362
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,840
 And he's saying, don't get overwhelmed with the big harvest.

363
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,320
 Don't get overwhelmed with all the needs.

364
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,400
 Don't get overwhelmed with pastoring the people around you that God has put around you and

365
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,560
 has highlighted to you.

366
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,880
 Don't get overwhelmed by that.

367
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
 Remember who the Lord of the harvest is.

368
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
 He's the living God.

369
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,840
 He's the God of all resources, all power, all authority.

370
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:51,600
 And he will provide for his people what we need to do the work he's inviting us into.

371
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,880
 So don't get overwhelmed.

372
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,760
 And he has gone before, he's already at work in the harvest field.

373
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,840
 He's already out there in the streets and in the city and in your family and in your

374
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
 neighborhood.

375
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
 He's already working.

376
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,680
 He's already drawing people to himself.

377
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:18,160
 But he's waiting for us, his church, to go.

378
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:28,880
 So when we get overwhelmed with these needs, and they are huge, we need to start with prayer.

379
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,780
 We start with prayer.

380
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,380
 And Jesus works through prayer.

381
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,480
 He will provide through prayer.

382
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,240
 He will do a work in our hearts through prayer.

383
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,160
 And when his church prays, we are sent out into the city.

384
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,280
 But it's not just us.

385
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,120
 God will also raise up other workers.

386
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,720
 It's not just that we pray and then he sends us out of the church.

387
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,480
 When we pray for workers to be sent out of the harvest, he will raise up other workers

388
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,280
 that we don't even know about.

389
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:04,520
 We have visions, we have dreams, we have plans to do kingdom work.

390
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,400
 But he mobilizes people through prayer.

391
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,720
 So we are called to pray.

392
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:16,080
 Now what I also find fascinating is that the Greek word that Jesus uses when he tells us

393
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,160
 to pray to send out workers, the word send out, ekballo, it's actually a very strong

394
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
 word.

395
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,200
 And here are some of the meanings for it.

396
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,720
 Send out, cast out, flung out, drive out, thrust out.

397
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:38,520
 It's actually the same word that is used for driving out a demon in scripture.

398
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
 Thrust out.

399
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,920
 Now why is that?

400
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,080
 Why is Jesus asking us to pray in such strong language?

401
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
 Well here's what I believe.

402
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,320
 I believe that Jesus is asking us to pray that workers are thrust out because we are

403
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,120
 comfortable in our routines.

404
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,880
 And we're living in our comfort zones.

405
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,360
 And we need the spirit of God, the light of fire for us to actually go out.

406
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,560
 To be thrust out, we need a kick in the rear end.

407
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,200
 And it happens through prayer, through Holy Spirit moving.

408
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:25,300
 And what's also fascinating with this, this whole part just fascinates me, is that you

409
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,240
 and I, we are Jesus's prayer requests.

410
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,040
 But what do I mean by that?

411
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,720
 Well Jesus does not ask us to pray in this instance for those who are hurting, who are

412
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
 out in the street.

413
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,200
 But he actually asks us to pray for the church.

414
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,920
 He asks us to pray for workers to be sent out.

415
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,760
 Have you ever thought about that?

416
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,920
 Like we're Jesus's prayer requests.

417
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,400
 We need prayer.

418
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:59,720
 Because we need to be thrust out into the harvest field.

419
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,440
 So we're the ones who are stuck in the comfort zone.

420
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,160
 We're the ones who know the gospel.

421
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,440
 We're the ones who know that Jesus changes lives.

422
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,440
 But we need the spirit of God to move us out into the city, into the workplaces, into the

423
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:27,720
 neighborhoods to share the love of Jesus with those around us.

424
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,480
 Now I know that some of you are sitting here, yeah but it's not me.

425
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,520
 You know you're talking about these other Christians that like know the Bible and stuff

426
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,020
 really well.

427
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:44,040
 You're talking about those who have their life in order, who are living very holy and

428
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,920
 pleasing to God lives.

429
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:56,040
 You're talking about the NGO workers or the missionaries or the pastors that do this stuff.

430
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:06,800
 Jesus when he says pray for workers, the word workers in Greek ergates, it means day laborer.

431
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,820
 It's not somebody with special skills.

432
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,880
 It's not somebody with a PhD in biblical languages.

433
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,240
 It's just a day laborer.

434
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,400
 So the tasks that we're sent out to do, that doesn't require any special skills.

435
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,080
 We all can do the job.

436
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,600
 You all can do the job.

437
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,280
 We all know how to listen to people.

438
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,200
 We all know how to give people a hug.

439
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,400
 We all know how to invite somebody over for coffee or tea or whatever it is that you drink.

440
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,760
 We all know how to practically help people with the resources that God has given us.

441
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,760
 And we all know how to share about Jesus and the work that he's done in our lives.

442
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,880
 Now we might not say that in the most beautiful way, but you know how to talk about Jesus

443
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,280
 and the work he's done in your life.

444
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,760
 So the most important part is actually willingness and available.

445
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,200
 Are we willing to go out and to be used by God?

446
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,680
 Are we available to God?

447
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,160
 Now a lot of times we focus on the things we don't have.

448
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,920
 I don't have my perfect life left.

449
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,640
 I don't know the Bible perfectly.

450
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,280
 I don't have this.

451
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:26,280
 I don't have that, but we need to focus on what we have.

452
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,320
 You know, we know how to love.

453
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,440
 We know Jesus.

454
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:40,200
 We have a testimony and we're sent out by the Holy Spirit to do this work.

455
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,080
 And when God sends us, we can do it.

456
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
 And guess what?

457
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,720
 Actually a lot of times you learn on the job.

458
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,840
 You learn by going.

459
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
 So we need to go.

460
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,480
 We're invited to go.

461
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,120
 Now I want to invite the worship team to come up.

462
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,480
 Now in chapter 10, so moving on in the text, supposedly the disciples, they prayed this

463
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,240
 prayer for God to send out workers.

464
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,040
 And then they are the answer to this prayer because Jesus then sends them out to the lost

465
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:18,040
 sheep of Israel at this time and to do his work, his healing and restoring work.

466
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:24,560
 That's interesting there too because there's a transition that takes place in the disciples.

467
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,520
 So first they're referred to as disciples.

468
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,560
 Then suddenly they're referred to as apostles.

469
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,600
 Now apostle, the Greek word literally means sent out messenger.

470
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,720
 Suddenly they become the sent out ones who are sent out into the harvest field that is

471
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,080
 ripe.

472
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,920
 And so they went from bystanders and people observed Jesus, which was okay because that's

473
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,960
 what they needed to do at the beginning, to being participants and it was redeeming work

474
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,360
 and healing work.

475
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:04,880
 And I believe that God this year is calling us into this transition of going deeper into

476
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,680
 being participants in his work, in this neighborhood, in the city, in your family, in your workplace,

477
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:21,120
 where he wants to use you to share the gospel message, to bring God's love, to bear in practical

478
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,440
 ways to the people around you.

479
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,400
 But the question is, are we available?

480
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:36,720
 And do we care to see lives restored to Jesus?

481
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,160
 Do we care to see this guy restored in the park to Jesus?

482
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,760
 Do we care to see the coworker restored to Jesus?

483
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:50,320
 Do we care to see the mom who's maybe overwhelmed with all that's on her plate to restore it

484
00:33:50,320 --> 00:34:00,720
 to Jesus and experiences love and his care from his people, from God's people?

485
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:14,320
 Now as I was thinking about this word and I was picturing and imagining the end of 2025,

486
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
 what do I see?

487
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,960
 What if we all would make ourselves available?

488
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,760
 What if we all pray this prayer and ask Jesus to send us out, to thrust us out into his

489
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
 vineyard?

490
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,480
 What if we actually start doing this work and respond when God highlights somebody,

491
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:38,040
 we start caring for them and serving them and sharing the good news with them.

492
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,960
 And I really believe that if we make ourselves available, that God will do immeasurably more

493
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,400
 than we can ask or imagine.

494
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,760
 That at the end of 2025, we'll have many people in this room, we have been touched by the

495
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,760
 love of Jesus.

496
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,760
 When we communicated about the church plan, one of the things we said right from the beginning

497
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:14,000
 is that it is our heart's desire that it is a regular occurrence that people are coming

498
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,720
 to know Jesus.

499
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,440
 I want to see that happening.

500
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,240
 That's my desire.

501
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
 I desire that.

502
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,800
 I long for that.

503
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:33,760
 I want to see people who are hopeless, who are hurting, find hope, find healing.

504
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,840
 But the question is, are we going to pray this prayer to ask the Lord of the harvest

505
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,040
 to send out his workers into the harvest field?

506
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,400
 And when he sends us, are we going to be willing to go and do this work?

507
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,120
 Now I actually want us to start off with praying this prayer.

508
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,920
 So start off this year with praying this prayer.

509
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,600
 And we actually pray what Jesus asked us to pray.

510
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,160
 So I want to invite you to turn to somebody around you to ask them, is it okay if I pray

511
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,160
 with you?

512
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,440
 Maybe somebody you know, maybe somebody you just met, maybe somebody you never met, but

513
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,760
 now you're going to talk to them.

514
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,880
 And you just ask them, hey, can we pray together for this, for Jesus to send out workers into

515
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,120
 the harvest field?

516
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,520
 And then while you're at it, I also want to encourage you, if you want to do this, just

517
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
 say, Jesus, this is my heart's desire.

518
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
 I long for this.

519
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
 I'm available.

520
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
 Just express that.

521
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,760
 So we're going to take a few minutes to do that, and then I'll pray for us.

522
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
 So let's turn to each other right now.

523
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,400
 Let's pray for each other, pray with each other, and then I'll bring us back.

524
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
 So let's do this, church.

525
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
 Amen.

526
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,400
 Amen.

527
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:52,400
 Amen.
