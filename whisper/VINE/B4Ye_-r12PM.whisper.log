[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   Let me pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.280]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.080]   Hey, as you sit down, say hi to somebody sitting near you.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.080]   Say, "Hey, nice to welcome you to church.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.920]   Nice to have you here.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.160]   Be kind, be friendly."
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:22.320]   Well, good morning, good morning, good morning.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320]   Welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320]   My name is Angelo Mundapastor.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.680]   If you're new to The Vine, we're so glad that you're here.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.840]   We're in week three of a four-week series, the first series of this new year, where we're
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.760]   actually kind of talking about and wanting to teach you about four important mindset
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.400]   shifts that need to happen in our lives if we're going to move into 2025 in the way that
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.000]   we're sensing the Holy Spirit wants to call us as a church to move into.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.920]   In 2024, we told you that it was a year of intimacy and God was calling us into a place
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.480]   of deep intimacy with Him, but intimacy is a platform by which we then launch into the
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.440]   story that Christ has for us in our lives.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.720]   And in 2025, we believe that this is to be a year of action, a year where we take our
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.440]   faith and we begin to live it more boldly, more courageously, and perhaps more publicly
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.680]   in our city around us.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.320]   We're saying that there are four mindset shifts that need to happen in us to transition from
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.520]   this place of greater intimacy into a place of having that courage and that boldness to
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.840]   live our faith more publicly.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280]   And we're basing this series in the life of Samuel and David, and particularly at the
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.520]   end of Samuel's life, the last judge of Israel as he prepares to hand that over to the kingship.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.960]   And then in David, who becomes, as Israel would end up calling him, the start of the
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.400]   Davidic dynasty, the king that would bring the bloodline that would ultimately bring
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.600]   in the life of Christ Jesus.
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.240]   And so we're sitting in this incredible moment of history, a transition between one time
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.100]   to another and the picture and the life of two men who transition themselves from a place
[00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.160]   of intimacy into a place of needed action.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.240]   And in that, we see these four things that they do.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.980]   We've already seen in this series that we need to have the right start.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.620]   Last week, we looked at what it is to have and make the right choices.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.680]   And today I want to speak to you about wearing the right clothes.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.020]   Yes, the right clothes.
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.880]   Now what on earth is that all about?
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.480]   What I understand that we need to pick up the story from where Ellison left it off last
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.900]   week.
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.160]   So Samuel has just anointed David to be king.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.000]   But what's fascinating actually is that David doesn't become king for another further 12
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   years.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.440]   That's a whole sermon in and of itself.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.760]   You have to understand that sometimes when God anoints us, it doesn't necessarily mean
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.200]   that it's time to begin the task that he's anointed us for.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.880]   Sometimes we actually need a season of waiting.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.740]   We need a season of understanding, a season of learning and growing.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.740]   Sometimes we need a development of a skill set or development of a character.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.860]   So although God anoints David to become king, it's not 12 years until he takes on that actual
[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.700]   anointing, that actual mantle.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.220]   And there's so much skill and so much personal character that he needs to develop over those
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.100]   12 years so that when he walks into that anointing for the first time, he actually has the skill
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.740]   and the character to hold him in the place that that anointing has for him.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.600]   So don't always think that because God's anointed you for something, it's necessarily the right
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.900]   time for you to begin.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.260]   Sometimes there's a need for the waiting, for the learning and for the growing.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.660]   We see that happen for David.
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.700]   He's taken straight into Saul's household.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.940]   And the Scriptures tell us that Saul loves David, likes David immediately.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.860]   And it's partly because Saul's in a really hard time of his life.
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.580]   He's actually having demonic fits.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.540]   And David is the only one who can take a harp and begin to play the harp and soothe Saul's
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.140]   demonic aspirations and what's happening in his life.
[00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.660]   And so Saul and David actually create a strong bond together early on.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.780]   And Scriptures tell us that Saul so admires David that he makes him his armor bearer.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.060]   Now that's actually important for what we're about to see in our story here today.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.040]   But an armor bearer was one who was responsible for looking after, making sure they were ready,
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.980]   the battle armor of the king.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.220]   So David's role was to understand the armor that Saul needed to go into battle, make sure
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.660]   that armor was always battle ready, make sure the weapons were sharp and clean and oiled
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.680]   up, making sure the armor looked the way it needed to be, was nice and clean.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.820]   This was his job.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.060]   He was the armor bearer to Saul.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.580]   Now interestingly, war does immediately break out.
[00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.580]   The nation of Philistia rises up and begins to attack Israel.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.340]   Now in those days there was a common practice that took place on the battlefield.
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.580]   Rather than having all the armies fight each other in this prolonged battle where many
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.480]   deaths would occur, it was also okay if one of the nations sends forward their best warrior,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.100]   the one who could fight the most, who was the strongest warrior, and challenged the
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.580]   best warrior of the other side to a battle.
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.980]   And it's just the two of them fighting out that battle and whoever would win, well then
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.780]   that nation would be the ultimate winner.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.580]   This was a way of saving lives, it was a way of saving time, and this is exactly what Philistia
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.580]   do.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.900]   They send out their best warrior, this man by the name of Goliath.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.300]   Goliath is described in scripture as being nine feet tall and being a champion in battle
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.420]   since he was a boy.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.660]   And actually it records to us Israel's response.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.740]   Israel's response is one of fear and dismay.
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.300]   The Bible tells us that they were terrified by this warrior, Goliath.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.860]   So I want you to see the picture here.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.820]   Here's a situation where an army has come to attack Israel.
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.220]   This Goliath has stepped forward and said, "Look, send your best warrior out to fight
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.260]   me and whoever wins, that will be the nation that will take the land."
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.380]   And Israel is dismayed and they're terrified because this guy's nine feet tall and they
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.580]   don't have anybody in their ranks who's nine feet tall.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.100]   And they don't see that this is at all a fair battle.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.260]   And the Bible tells us that for 40 days, Goliath, every single day, fully arrayed in his battle
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.540]   armor comes forward and challenges Israel to this battle and says, "Send me your best
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.540]   warrior."
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:44.320]   And for 40 days, Israel says, "No, we don't have anyone we think can fight you."
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.740]   And every single day, Goliath is basically bringing down the name of Israel, bringing
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.220]   down their God, laughing at their fear.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.220]   One day, David decides enough is enough.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.200]   I mean, David's been looking around and he's been like, "Come on, people.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.740]   Somebody fight this guy.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.740]   Come on, somebody can do it.
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.300]   You guys are warriors, you do it.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.600]   I'm just the armor bearer, but you're a warrior.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.020]   Why don't you fight him?
[00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.580]   No one is fighting him."
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.820]   And David's like, "Do you not hear what this guy is saying to us every day?
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.460]   Do you not hear how he's pulling down the name of God?
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.940]   Do you not hear the ways in which he's threatening us?
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.340]   We need to stand up against this guy and our God is going to fight this battle for us.
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.340]   Somebody has to go.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.460]   Well, if you're not going to go, I'll go."
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.980]   And so he actually goes to Saul and he says, "Hey, Saul, send me."
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.100]   And Saul is like, "Are you an idiot?
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.340]   Because you're the least of all my army people who can do this.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.420]   You're not even part of the army.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.540]   You're an armor bearer.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.180]   You're not even like a fighter.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.940]   You're not even a trainer.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.380]   You're like the guy that wraps the box gloves.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.940]   You know, the person who tapes up the gloves for the guy that's actually going to do the
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.940]   battle.
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.940]   That's what you are.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.940]   You're the armor bearer.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.220]   You cannot do this."
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.500]   And David in response was like, "You need to understand my resume."
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.500]   So fun.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   I think David's so bold.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.220]   He's like, "I didn't always be a harp player or an armor bearer.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.220]   I used to be a shepherd."
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.220]   And then Saul's like, "Okay, great.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.220]   Go."
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.220]   He's like, "What do you mean you were a shepherd?"
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.220]   He's like, "I was a shepherd.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:20.580]   I was looking after my father's sheep and I used to have to defend against bears and
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.940]   defend against lions and I would chase after them and I would beat bears and I would beat
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.000]   lions and this Goliath, he's just a big oversized bear.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He's like a big lion.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I've done it before.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.500]   I can do it again."
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.940]   And for some reason, Saul says yes.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:44.940]   And I think the only reason Saul says yes is because he's too afraid to go himself.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.740]   And he realizes as king, he should probably be the one out there on the battlefield, but
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.980]   he decides not to do it.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.100]   He's too scared.
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.100]   He's too afraid.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.580]   He won't step up to the moment.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:02.060]   So a shepherd boy who is currently an armor bearer decides to go and Saul says, "All right,
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.060]   go."
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.700]   Well, we know the rest of the story, don't we?
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.900]   And he puts those five stones in his pouch and he takes up his sling and he gets his
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.860]   staff and he runs out like a shepherd boy and he runs towards Goliath and he says, "You've
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.620]   been desecrating the name of my Lord."
[00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.900]   Smacks him in the head with one stone, kills him straight away, falls on the ground, takes
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.540]   out a sword, cuts off his head, holds it up in front of everybody.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:31.080]   Israel is victorious and it's one of the most glorious moments in history where an underdog
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.620]   beats the one that he was not expected to beat.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:43.820]   But in that story, there is a moment where I think the victory really takes place and
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.060]   it's not when he throws the stone.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.100]   It's not when he cuts off the head.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.620]   It actually happens quite a bit before then.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.980]   And it's a part of the story that we don't think about very often.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.400]   It's often overlooked.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.300]   But actually when we understand this part of the story and we actually begin to think
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.820]   about how we might take the principle of that and live it out in our lives, then we begin
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:14.260]   to position ourselves for what it is that God truly can do only through us.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.100]   So I want to pick up the story at the point where David gives his resume to Saul, this
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.780]   seemingly not very effective or great resume.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.780]   You guys okay?
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:29.580]   Let me read this to you from Samuel 1, 17 starting in verse 34.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.100]   So David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep."
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.100]   Saul's like, "Great."
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.100]   "When a lion or a bear came and carried off his sheep from the flock, I went after it
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.180]   and I struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.500]   When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it down and I killed it.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.160]   Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:54.220]   This uncircumcised Philistine will be like just one of them because he has defiled the
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.260]   armies of the living God.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:00.860]   For the Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.420]   me from the hand of this Philistine."
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.980]   Saul said to David, "Go and the Lord be with you."
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.900]   Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic and he put a coat of armor on him and a bronze
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.300]   helmet on his head.
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.540]   David fastened the sword over the tunic and tried to walk around, but he was not used
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.540]   to them.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.220]   "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I'm not used to them."
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.220]   So he took them off.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.180]   Then he took up his staff and his hand and he chose five smooth stones from the stream
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:36.420]   and he put them in the pouch of his shepherd's rag and with his sling in his hand, approached
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.580]   the Philistine.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.820]   I love what Saul does here.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.960]   Saul does this seemingly contradictory thing.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.340]   He decides that he's going to let David go and he says these words, "Okay, I'm going
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.660]   to let you now go."
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.940]   And he says, "I want you to go in the Lord."
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.500]   That sounds good, doesn't it?
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.700]   He says, "I want you to go in the Lord," but then he does something immediately that
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.620]   seems to contradict exactly what he says.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.900]   He says, "I want you to go in the Lord, but I'm going to dress you like myself."
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.700]   Come on, church, I want you to see this.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.420]   He says, "I want you to go in the Lord, but I'm going to put my clothes on you."
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:16.060]   Now you have to understand that Saul is doing this out of a place of love.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.700]   He's doing this out of a place of wanting the best for David.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.940]   He's like, "David, if you're going to go, well then you better look the part.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.980]   You better look like a warrior out there on the field, even though you're not really a
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.380]   warrior.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:36.660]   And you're my armor bearer, so if anybody knows my armor better than anyone, it's you.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:42.000]   You've looked after my tunic and my armor all your life, all the last number of years.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.460]   You know it so well, so here's the blessing I'm going to give to you, David."
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.700]   Saul's thinking, "If I can do the best thing for you, it is to give you my armor."
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.020]   That was a huge honor.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.260]   The king never gave his armor to anyone else.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.420]   He never did that.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.200]   But Saul's thinking, "What's the best way that I can prepare you and equip you for the
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.860]   battle that you're about to be in?
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.500]   What's the best thing I can do for you?"
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.600]   It's to give you the best that we have, the best sword, the sharpest armor, the most expensive
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.780]   weaponry that we have, and it's mine.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.260]   "I bless you, David.
[00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.260]   Take this.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.220]   Put this on you."
[00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:24.460]   Saul's doing it from a place of great honor, a great love, and he places this stuff upon
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:30.580]   David because he wants to equip him as best he can for the battle that's ahead.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:37.140]   And David takes these things onto his shoulders because, oh, could you imagine the honor that
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.500]   you could wear the king's armor?
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.140]   The problem is the Bible has told us a couple of pages beforehand that Saul is heads and
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.900]   shoulders above everybody else in Israel.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.820]   It's described Saul as actually being quite broad and strong, and it's also described
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.420]   David as being the smallest of all his brothers, to being the runt in the liquor.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.580]   So I wonder if you could actually follow the thought here.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.540]   Saul says, "You need to wear my tunic."
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.780]   David takes on that because he wants to honor the person who's doing that for him, but I
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:16.860]   wonder if you could imagine what the fit was like.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.820]   I think it was something like this.
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:24.220]   So he takes on this beautiful thing that has been prepared for him, and the problem is
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.020]   it just doesn't fit.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.300]   Now could you imagine how David would have felt?
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.660]   He's got the honor of wearing something, but he realizes, "Hang on a sec.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.340]   I'm not sure if this is for me.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.900]   I'm not sure if this is how I'm supposed to look."
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:48.300]   The irony is that Saul looked great in that armor, but David, it didn't fit.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.540]   For Saul, he was comfortable in that armor, but you can imagine for David, he wasn't particularly
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.860]   comfortable in what he was wearing.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.980]   See, you need to understand that David was dressed for the right battle, but wearing
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.220]   the wrong clothes.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.500]   Come on, church.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.780]   He's dressed for the right battle, but he's wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:16.380]   As we start 2025, we have to understand that if this is the place that we live in, if Hong
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.980]   Kong is your home, if this is the place that God has planted you in, and you're working
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.940]   here, and you're a part of the vine, and this is your community of faith, no matter how
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.020]   you might feel about Hong Kong or how you might be feeling about Hong Kong's history,
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.820]   if this is where God has placed you in this season of your life, you need to understand
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.100]   that you're in the right battle.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:40.180]   That this is the place, this city, through your skills and your thing and everything
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.860]   that you're doing, where God is calling you to bring the hope of the gospel into this
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.900]   land.
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.340]   The place for you to bring what it is that God has uniquely placed on you to show His
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.340]   love and His mercy and His graciousness to the people around you.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.720]   If this is your home, you're in the right battle.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.460]   The question you have to ask yourself is, "Are you wearing the right clothes?
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:05.140]   Are you actually wearing the right clothes that will help you in the battle that you
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.420]   are in?"
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:15.380]   And the reality is, like David, so many of us can end up wearing somebody else's clothes
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.800]   in our battle.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.220]   You got to understand, you cannot go into your battle wearing somebody else's armor.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.140]   Come on, church.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.860]   Is anybody here today?
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.180]   You guys okay?
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:34.020]   You cannot go into your battle wearing someone else's armor.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.020]   And I know what you're thinking.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.980]   You're like, "Well, I don't think I do that.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.980]   I don't think I do that."
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.320]   If you're anything like me, that's how I often think.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.900]   But the reality is, so often people are trying to put their clothes on your shoulders.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.020]   And like in David's situation, they have really good intentions about it.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.580]   Oh, they love you.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.060]   They want the best for you.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.660]   They want you to win the battle.
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.860]   They want you to have the best life possible.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:04.900]   And in their desire for you to succeed as best as possible, they put themselves on you.
[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.940]   They put what they think is best for you on you.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.860]   They decide how they think it would be best for you to live your life, and they place
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.860]   it on you.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.120]   It comes from a good place of intention, but they're still placing their hopes and dreams
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:24.380]   on your shoulders, rather than perhaps the very things that God is calling you to do.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:27.940]   Now, sometimes it actually is not coming from a place of good intention.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.380]   It actually comes from a place of bad intention.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.140]   So as much as we may all have people who love us in our lives who are placing their clothes
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.620]   on our shoulders out of a place of good intention, we also can have bad people in our lives who
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.040]   are trying to place their things on us in order for us to fail.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.740]   That also happens in life.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.600]   I've experienced that many times.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.040]   Maybe you have too.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.140]   So whether from good intentions or from bad intentions, we can all end up wearing the
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.140]   wrong clothes.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.460]   What are some of the clothes that people try to put on us?
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.040]   Let's go to my little clothes rack.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.840]   I think first of all, their expectations.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.640]   The kind of expectations that they have about you.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.300]   What they think you should be, how they think you should act.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.060]   Their expectations to define how they think you would be best in battle.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.340]   And again, it might come from a good place or it might come from a bad place, but they're
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.180]   placing their expectations on you.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:30.580]   And you know that the wearing of somebody else's expectations is a heavy burden.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.760]   Amen.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.020]   Maybe it's not expectations.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.140]   Maybe for some of you, let's have a look at how this might work for some of you.
[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.760]   Maybe it's values.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.660]   Maybe they place some values on you that they think are important.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.100]   Values that they own, values that they think are the right ones for you.
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.820]   And if you could just live their values, then you would work out okay in this world.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:57.460]   And so they taught you or told you or forced you into a situation where you're embracing
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:02.740]   values that are theirs more than values that are Jesus'.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.380]   Or and I'm just going to get real personal with many of us here.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.020]   This is personal as well for me.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.880]   Look at these ones.
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.300]   They tell you about the university you should go to.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:19.420]   They tell you about the career you should have, the type of person you should be.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.020]   They tell you about the company that you could work for.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:28.500]   And again, maybe a place of great intention, maybe a place of wanting the best for you
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.140]   or in a place where actually they want you to mess up, they place these sort of things
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.860]   on your shoulders.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.000]   They say this is the stuff that you need to do.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.240]   This is the kind of career you need to have if you're going to survive in Hong Kong.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.780]   This is the kind of company.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.500]   You better have an aspiration to work for.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.460]   You're going to go to university in a few years.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.540]   You need to get better grades so you can go to the university that I'm going to be proud
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.660]   about sharing with my friends over a beer.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.780]   Oh, that was a bit too personal.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.780]   Okay.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.020]   Are you with me?
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.940]   I think there's some cultures around us where we end up wearing so much everybody's else's
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:11.900]   item of clothes and it's weighing us down and you're in the right battle, but you're
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.980]   wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.340]   Let me tell you, there's also a situation where it's not just that people are placing
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.900]   this stuff on you.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:26.340]   There's also a situation where you're deciding to place it upon you, where maybe they haven't
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:32.260]   put expectations on you, but you've decided to take expectations on yourself.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.860]   I know this one very personally because this is what happened to me when I took over the
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.700]   vine as senior pastor in 2013.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:43.140]   I was incredibly well prepared by two men who had served this church so faithfully.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.540]   Our previous senior pastors, John and Tony.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.540]   John and Tony had done this amazing thing with the vine.
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.780]   They had taken a church of about 40 people and they had grown it into a large, successful,
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:54.780]   great church.
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:02.420]   At the age of 37, relatively young guy, these two men handed this beautiful, great, successful,
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:10.420]   wonderful thing to a 37-year-old who had no idea, who was in the right battle and decided
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.020]   he needed somebody else's clothes.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.940]   I thought, "Well, if I'm going to take over the vine, then I need to be really careful
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.780]   that I don't become the first senior pastor in the vine's history where the vine goes
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.860]   off a cliff, where everybody starts to leave, where nothing works out."
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.700]   And I thought to myself, "Well, what has made this church successful so far?"
[00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.460]   John and Tony didn't put this on me, but I looked at them and I chose to put on their
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.020]   clothes.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.900]   I was like, "Well, I need to keep this thing running.
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.300]   I need to keep it working well.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.820]   It's worked well up to this point, so let me just take the ideas and the thoughts and
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.780]   the themes and the ways in which they do things and let me just place that on my shoulders
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.380]   because I guess that's what's going to help me in this battle that I feel not that equipped
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.380]   for.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.580]   If I could just wear their clothes, everything's going to be all right."
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.380]   And it drained me.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.820]   They didn't do this to me.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.140]   I took this on myself.
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.940]   Are you with me?
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:07.940]   And in putting on their clothes, I found myself weighed down, exhausted, overwhelmed.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.700]   And about a year into it, I took Christine out for dinner.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.700]   We went out for dinner.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.220]   We sat down at the table, and as soon as we sat down at the table, I just started weeping
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.900]   and weeping publicly in this restaurant.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.420]   It was really embarrassing.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:29.460]   But I was so tired, exhausted from wearing somebody else's clothes in the right battle
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.860]   that I was supposed to be in.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.300]   Perhaps you're resonating with this here today.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.180]   You know what it is to wear the expectations, the choices, and the decisions that others
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.260]   have made for you.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.620]   Sometimes that's come from good places.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.340]   Sometimes it's come from bad places.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.020]   Sometimes they've placed it on you without even you wanting it.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:56.100]   Other times you've taken it on yourself, but you are dressed in the wrong clothes.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.820]   Why do we do this?
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.980]   Why do we take on other people's clothes onto our lives?
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.660]   I think there are three reasons.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:06.540]   First, we do it like David did, out of respect, out of honor.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.540]   I love my parents.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.540]   They're great.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.860]   I don't want to upset my parents.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.060]   They want this for me.
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.540]   I should do this because I want to honor them.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.540]   I want to love them.
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.740]   The Bible tells me that I should honor and respect my parents.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.660]   I should do what they're asking me to do.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:26.260]   We take it on board because we have respect or honor for those in authority around us.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.660]   Perhaps we take it on board because we want to be accepted by the people that clothes
[00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.660]   that we're going to wear.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.660]   Oh, I just want them to like me.
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.540]   I just want them to accept me a little bit.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.140]   I want to actually be more like them.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.940]   Perhaps if I could be more like them, they would then accept me into their tribe.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.500]   So I'm going to put on clothes that look like their clothes, even though they're not designed
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.620]   or they don't fit me because I want to fit in.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.620]   I don't want to feel lonely.
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.180]   I don't want to be on the outside.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.260]   I want to be accepted and I want to be loved.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.820]   You have to understand, if you try to put on somebody else's clothes, if you try to
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:04.140]   become like someone else in order for them to accept you or like you, you will always
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.060]   end up sacrificing something of who you really are.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.580]   When you do that, you always end up living a diminished life.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.100]   You might think you're trying to fit in and try to be approved and try to look like other
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.460]   people, but you're only going to be trying to wear their clothes in a battle that those
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.660]   clothes do not fit.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.940]   You will diminish yourself.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.900]   I want to be honest and say some of you in this room, you're living a pale imitation
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.900]   of somebody else's life.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.260]   You're trying to be so much like someone to fit in and to be accepted.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.780]   You are dampening the light of Christ that Christ has placed in you.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.020]   Are you with me still?
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.140]   The third reason why I think we wear other people's clothes is out of fear.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.540]   Fear of disappointing someone.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.460]   Fear of what happens if I don't wear what they've asked me to wear.
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.700]   Fear of whether I might lose my job if I stand against that, because that's a value that
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.020]   I don't want to embrace.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.100]   Fear that if I do that, maybe the family won't accept me anymore.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.300]   If I stand against it, we can have this fear.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.740]   Whether it's just out of honor and respect or whether it's because we're trying to fit
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.500]   in or whether it's because we're fearful that if we don't wear the clothes, then everything
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.780]   else will not work out for us.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.540]   Whatever it is, when you're in a time of battle, wearing somebody else's clothes will always
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:29.840]   become more a burden you have to carry than a weapon you can use.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:35.500]   When you're in a battle, those clothes will become a burden to you more than a weapon
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.660]   that you can actually use.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.180]   So if this is resonating with you, the question we should ask ourselves is, "Well, what do
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.180]   we do?"
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.180]   Right?
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.180]   What do we do?
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.780]   What actually he does next.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.140]   In verse 39, I love this.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:52.140]   By the way, I feel really silly wearing this, but hey, stay with me.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.300]   In verse 39, it says this, "David fastened the sword around his tunic and tried to walk
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.180]   around because it was not used to them."
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.220]   He says, "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I am not used to them."
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.620]   I love this about David.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.400]   Oh my goodness.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.260]   He's wearing these clothes that don't fit him.
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.020]   He's trying to make it work.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.260]   It's out of honor and love and respect received and placed onto his shoulders what someone
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.320]   else has placed on him.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.580]   But at some point he realizes, "I cannot go in these."
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.260]   I want you to know that at the beginning of 2025, as you think about what it might mean
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.900]   to move into a year of action, as you think about what it might mean for you to go forward,
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.460]   some of us in this room have to realize we're currently wearing the wrong clothes and we're
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.660]   going to have to have the courage and the boldness to say, "I cannot go in these.
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:44.180]   I cannot move forward currently weighed down by other people's expectations.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:49.460]   I cannot move forward if I'm trying to live to please other people's choices.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.860]   I cannot move forward if my whole life is designed right now to try to fit in and be
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.620]   like others so that I don't stand out.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.160]   No, I cannot go in these."
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:05.060]   Some of us, we're living a life where we're having to act as other people want us to act
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.700]   when we know deep down inside that God has called us to be different.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.180]   And somewhere along the way, we're going to have to get that courage and boldness in us
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.700]   to say, "I cannot go forward.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.300]   I will not take another step forward.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.300]   I have to take ownership for the clothes that I'm currently wearing and realize that I'm
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:29.500]   not going to take a step forward this year wearing what somebody else wanted me to wear.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:36.900]   I will only go forward if I am liberated from the things that have been placed upon me.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.100]   I cannot go in these."
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.340]   It's a beautiful idea, isn't it?
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.340]   How do we embrace it?
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.060]   Well, notice what he does next.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.500]   I love this also in verse 39.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.500]   It says this.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.820]   Notice, this is very important.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.860]   It says, "He then took them off."
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.980]   There you go.
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.980]   Preach on that one.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.940]   So first of all, he says, "I cannot go in these."
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.260]   And then he goes, "He took them off."
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.340]   Which seems really simple, doesn't it?
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.540]   It's like, "Andrew, where is the preach point in this part?"
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:13.700]   It seems really simple, the idea that, "Okay, I realize that what I'm wearing does not fit
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.700]   me."
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.580]   I don't know, by the way, who this fitted, but it was a big person.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:20.060]   So I realize that this is not what I should be wearing.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.580]   This doesn't fit me.
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.300]   And I say, "I cannot go forward in these, so I just simply take them off."
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   It sounds simple.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.300]   Here's the challenge.
[00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:32.580]   Although it's simple, why do so few of us actually do it?
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:37.620]   Why do so few of us actually remove the thing that we know we shouldn't be wearing?
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.020]   And instead, we don't take off the old, we just try to put on the new.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.100]   Oh, I want to preach on this one for a little bit.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.580]   We Christians are really good at this.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.820]   We're like, "Okay, I realize I'm wearing the wrong expectations.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.060]   I realize I'm kind of trying to fit in too much.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.220]   I realize that the values that I'm holding are not really Christ's values and not really
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.060]   the Bible's values, and I want God's word.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.380]   I want His values.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.740]   I want His ideas.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.900]   So I realize that there is something for me in this world that is custom made for me.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.500]   This jacket is custom made for me.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.500]   I had this made.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.200]   It cost me a lot of money.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.520]   It fits me like a glove.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.380]   We know that God has promises that fit us like a glove, and here's what we do.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.980]   It's like, "Oh, I believe in Jesus now.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.180]   Cool.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.460]   I get to wear some new clothes."
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.220]   We put on the new clothes that Christ has given us, but the problem is we don't take
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.860]   off the old stuff.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.820]   So we start to walk around going, "Hey, I'm a Christian.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.020]   I'm in church on Sunday.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:37.020]   I feel good.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.020]   Do you like my jacket?
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.700]   It fits me really well.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.500]   Custom made by the blood of Christ for me."
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:48.020]   What we're trying to do is we're trying to actually embrace two scenarios.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.860]   One where we fit in when we're here on a Sunday, "Look at my jacket."
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   And one when we go throughout the week, "Oh, yeah.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.580]   Look at my jacket."
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.620]   We found ourselves in a situation where we're trying to live two lives in one.
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:07.780]   When we're in the office or we're out socially with friends, we're proud to embrace and try
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.340]   to fit in and look like everyone else and wear the expectations that everyone else looks
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.100]   even though it's stupid and it's big and we don't realize that it's not really for us.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.300]   But hey, that's okay.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.940]   No one's going to see my other jacket, are they?
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.740]   I'm still wearing it but no one's going to see it.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.500]   It's tucked behind the back.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.380]   And then when we go to community group on a Sunday or we go to church on a Sunday, we
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.340]   whip back in that thing and we go, "Let me just tidy up a little bit here.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.420]   So that I can wear my clothes the way they should be worn now.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.460]   Are you with me?"
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.940]   It's very simple.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.580]   David realizes that his clothes are too much.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.940]   He prophetically says, "I cannot go in these."
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.380]   And then he takes them off.
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.060]   Then he realizes that, "Actually, I cannot go forward wearing that stuff."
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.700]   Can you see how ridiculous this looks?
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.940]   And yet this is how we live as Christians almost all the time.
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.940]   That we think that we can do both.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.060]   The Bible is very clear.
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.620]   When you are in Christ, you are a new creation.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.940]   The old is gone, the new has come.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.300]   Jesus himself said, "You cannot put new wine into old wineskins.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.220]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.940]   You have to realize that you need to take off the way you were living before in order
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.820]   to put on your newness in Christ."
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.900]   And that journey is actually courageous.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:31.140]   It was courageous for David to say to Saul, who he loved and respected, "I cannot go forward
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.140]   in your clothes.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.260]   I'm so grateful you gave them to me.
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:38.300]   I honor you for allowing me to try them, but I've walked around for a little while and
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.300]   this isn't me.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.620]   And if you want me to succeed in the battle, you need to trust that I know how it is that
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:44.860]   I am supposed to be.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.500]   And I respect you, I love you, Saul, but I am not going to go forward in these.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.740]   No, I'm actually going to take off the things that I shouldn't be wearing.
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.660]   The things that I'm trying to cover up.
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:00.500]   I'm going to remove these things so that I can go forward in the way that I've actually
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.620]   been asked and created to go forward in.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:08.740]   I have the courage to take off what I shouldn't be wearing."
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.740]   Now when we do that, here's the thing.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.420]   I want you to be really clear.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.580]   This is not a call to nakedness.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:16.580]   Okay?
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.580]   It's very important.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.460]   If you're writing notes, write that down.
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.660]   This is not a call to nakedness.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.660]   This is not like David going, "I'm going to take off all the things that I shouldn't be
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.660]   wearing.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.660]   I'm going to take off all my responsibilities.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.700]   I'm going to take off all the expectations that have been put on me, and I'm just going
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.980]   to be naked.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.280]   I'm going to be the purest version of myself that I can be."
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.280]   It's weird.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.580]   There's no human in the world right now that would define true freedom as getting rid of
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:48.420]   all expectations, getting rid of all responsibility, getting rid of how you think you should live
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.420]   your life, getting rid of wearing other people's stuff.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:56.340]   There's this thing like if you really want to truly be free, then you need to shed all
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.700]   of the things that shackle you.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.500]   The Bible never teaches that.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.660]   The Bible does not define freedom by having no responsibility.
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:10.040]   The Bible does not call you to a responsibility-free life.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:16.700]   The Bible calls you to the deep, beautiful, hard responsibility of dying to yourself,
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.020]   picking up your cross, and obeying and coming after Christ.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:26.020]   The Bible calls you to the responsibility to not be naked, to not think that freedom
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.500]   is defined by throwing off the shackles of what everyone's given me, but the harder work,
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.820]   I argue, of taking the responsibility of becoming more like Christ Jesus.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.940]   So there are things that we take off, absolutely, but there better be some things that we put
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.940]   on because we're not called to be naked.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.100]   I'm going to get to Genesis 3.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.660]   Oh my God, I love it when I preach from Genesis 3.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.260]   Genesis 3, "Before the fall of man, Adam and Eve were naked," and the Bible tells us they
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.380]   were unashamed.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.020]   Before sin, nakedness was fine.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.540]   But when sin happened, Adam and Eve realized that they were naked, and they realized that
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.180]   that was not right.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.900]   They were shamed by their nakedness, and here's what they do.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:12.100]   They then take the plants around them, and they make clothes for themselves, and they
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.620]   try to cover themselves up.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:17.660]   This is so funny because sometimes we realize we're naked, and then we think we know the
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.660]   best way to dress.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:23.380]   And so they try to cover themselves up because they want to try to make themselves right
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.380]   before God again.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.540]   "Okay, we screwed up.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.700]   We did something wrong.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.100]   We realize now we're naked.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.300]   We're going to try and do the best thing for us to try to cover us up."
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.300]   It's so important.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:41.220]   As much as you shouldn't wear somebody else's clothes, you also shouldn't try to dress yourself.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:44.460]   Because as much as you shouldn't be wearing what everybody else tells you to wear, you
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.980]   shouldn't then think that you know the best thing to wear, or to think that you know how
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.860]   to cover yourself, that you know the best way forward, that you can work it out.
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.700]   God shows up, and he sees them in the silly little coverings that they've made for themselves.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.500]   His heart is broken for them.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.580]   He's upset about the sin that has happened.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.040]   He rightly judges for that sin.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.760]   But then he comes and does this beautiful thing at the end of Genesis 3.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.580]   He makes new clothes for them.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.180]   He sews animal skins together, and he covers them in the way that he wants to give them
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.660]   dignity and honor and love.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:23.180]   And this idea of God covering us and giving us new clothes to wear in the dishonor of
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.060]   our nakedness becomes the cornerstone of the Christian faith.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:33.460]   You see, the Christian faith is not a call to nakedness and to call that freedom.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.700]   The Christian faith isn't even to realize that you're naked and you should close yourself.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:43.620]   The Christian faith is this idea to recognize that you're wearing the wrong clothes, remove
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.820]   those clothes from yourself, and allow him to place his clothes on you through the life
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.180]   and the death and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.020]   That's the Christian faith, that we have clothes that we get to put on.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:59.820]   Have a look at all these passages that are behind me here, and just look at some of them
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.820]   all.
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.820]   Isaiah 64, 8.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.820]   All of us have become like one who is unclean.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.980]   All of our righteous acts are like filthy rags.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.820]   The clothes that we currently wear are not right.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.020]   But then notice Isaiah 61, 10.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.620]   I delight greatly in the Lord, for my soul rejoices in God, for he has clothed me with
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.940]   garments of salvation, arrayed me in a robe of his righteousness.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:24.060]   In the New Testament, for all who are baptized into Christ have been clothed themselves with
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.060]   Christ.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.540]   Meanwhile, we grow longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, because when we
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.860]   are not clothed, we will not be found naked.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   Ephesians 1, I love.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.340]   If you were taught with regard to your formal way of life to put off your old self, there
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.980]   it is, to remove your old clothes, which are being corrupted by deceitful dyers, and to
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:48.300]   be made new in the attitude of your mind, and put on the new self created in God in
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.900]   true righteousness and holiness.
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.460]   So absolutely, there are clothes to be worn.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:59.700]   There is the right armor for the battle that Christ has for you, and it's the robes of
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.700]   his righteousness.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.460]   They're not your robes, they're not your clothes, they're not the things that you think you
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.540]   should put on to try to be better for the Lord.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.660]   It's the life, death, resurrection of Jesus, the holiness that has begun with us, the righteousness
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.460]   that is found in the blood of Christ.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.980]   We put on those things, and they fit us just right.
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:24.060]   And not only then are we in the right battle, but we're wearing the right armor.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.620]   David took up those stones, and he took up that staff, and he ran before Goliath as a
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.700]   shepherd boy.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.700]   Notice that.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.860]   Not an armor bearer, not a harp player.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:39.460]   He went back to the way he knew God had always called him to be, and he puts on the shepherd
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:43.900]   persona, the identity that Christ has always provided for him, the one where he knew that
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.900]   God was with him.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.300]   And he goes back, and he receives his true identity before the Lord, and in that identity
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.500]   he goes into battle and wins that battle.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.340]   And as you head into the year ahead, that's your call too.
[00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:02.540]   Look at this process that David goes through to prepare yourself to be victorious in the
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.660]   battles that are ahead of you.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.220]   The process is these three things.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.980]   Receive, sorry, realize, remove, receive.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.700]   Realize you're wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:20.140]   Take ownership over the reality that there have been clothes that have been placed on
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:25.260]   you not because of your fault, and perhaps by well-meaning people, but they are a burden
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.420]   on you, they're weighing you down.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:31.240]   Or perhaps you've taken those clothes and placed them on yourself for a desire to want
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:36.260]   to fit in and be accepted by the wrong kinds of people.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:41.980]   To realize and to take ownership of the reality that we're wearing the wrong clothes in the
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.980]   right battle.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:49.500]   And then to remove those clothes, to actually not try to cover them up by wearing clothes
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:54.100]   that we think we should wear in church, by not trying to cover up or pretend like everything's
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.260]   fine when we haven't actually done the work of repentance that we've been called to do.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.300]   The way we remove the clothes that we shouldn't be wearing is through the work of repentance,
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   this beautiful gift.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:07.900]   The Bible said that it is kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.740]   As we do that, we're taking action.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:15.460]   We're taking action for the way in which we have been clothed, knowing that we cannot
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.060]   go with these.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.740]   That we cannot move forward in the way that Christ wants us to move forward, wearing the
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:24.560]   wrong kind of thing.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:30.220]   And then, as we are naked before the Lord, receiving again from Him His righteousness,
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:35.860]   His grace, His forgiveness, His love, and in doing that, taking responsibility for the
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:40.740]   life in which He has called us to be, to pick up our cross, to die to ourselves, to listen
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.780]   to His word, to put His promises into action, and in doing that, be arrayed for the battle
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.380]   He has placed us in.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:53.740]   If this is Hong Kong, if it is your home, you are in the right battle.
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.980]   Are you wearing the right clothes?
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.620]   Can I pray for us?
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.500]   Let's pray.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:08.860]   Father I thank you in this moment for everybody here who you love so deeply.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:17.140]   And Lord, this is a city and a culture whereby which it's very easy to end up wearing clothes
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:22.140]   that don't fit us.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:29.740]   Some of you in this room, you have a heavy burden that's been laid upon you.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.420]   And I think for some of you that's come from well-meaning people, people who love you deeply,
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.060]   like Saul to David, people that want the best for you.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.780]   They want you to win the battle.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.580]   But wrongly, they think for you to win the battle, you need to be a little bit more like
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.140]   them.
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:47.060]   For you to win the battle, you need to do the things that they think you should do,
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.460]   that they think are the best for you.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.580]   And this is of course not about rebelling against the love and the honor.
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.140]   Remember David didn't do it out of rebellion.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.580]   He honored Saul as well in his response.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:07.100]   But some of you need to have the courage like David to actually say, "I cannot go in these.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.100]   I see your heart.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.140]   I see how much you love me.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.780]   I'm so grateful that you provided for me.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.460]   I know that you've got dreams for me, but you need to understand that that's not the
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.060]   dreams that God has put on my heart.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.980]   That is not the person that I believe God's called me to be.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:25.260]   And I love you and I respect you, but one of the things that David does here, he doesn't
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:31.940]   allow his love and respect for Saul to be greater than his conviction to be obedient
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.860]   to the things that God has called him to be.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:42.020]   And for some of you, that's your way of saying, "I cannot go in these."
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:47.400]   Some of you have taken on the clothes of others and you've done it because you've desperately
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.420]   wanted to fit in.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:55.540]   You know that you're wearing two jackets, one that actually doesn't fit and it wasn't
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:00.700]   made for you, and one that does fit and is made for you, but is thrown on top of the
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.640]   one that doesn't.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   Some of you are trying to live two lives.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.300]   You cannot do that.
[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.820]   That is only going to be the diminishing of the fullness of who you're created to be.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.540]   You cannot wear both jackets.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.420]   Christian faith doesn't call you to two types of life.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:25.340]   And so for some of you today, you need to repent.
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.140]   You need to actually come before the Lord and say, "God, I'm trying to do both.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:32.460]   In some context, I'm wearing these expectations and these values and I'm trying to look a
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.460]   certain way.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:37.540]   In other contexts, I'm trying to embrace your values and try to be like you, and I'm caught
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.100]   between the two of them and it's killing me."
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.380]   Some of you, this is a call to a greater level of picking up your cross and following after
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:57.580]   Christ, and it's the removing of the jacket that doesn't fit.
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:03.340]   So Holy Spirit, I thank you for what you want to do here.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:08.940]   And if this is helpful for you today, as your eyes are closed, I just want to encourage
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.380]   you to open your hands before you.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.800]   It doesn't really matter what your neighbor's doing.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.780]   This is just between you and God.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.140]   As you open up your hands before the Lord, it's your way of saying, "God, I recognize
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.740]   in me something of what David went through.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:27.140]   I know that I've been carrying and wearing the wrong clothes.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.980]   I know I've been trying to wear two jackets at once."
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:37.260]   Father, for every person whose hands are open in this room right now, here's what I want
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.260]   to pray, Lord.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.260]   I want to pray, "Realize, remove, receive."
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:47.800]   Lord, as they open their hands, they're realizing that that's their reality.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.260]   And again, for many of them in this room, it's not their fault.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:54.880]   They've just been in a situation where somebody has thrown the heaviness of expectations,
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:01.260]   the heaviness of burden and choices and decisions that they've had to live for a long time.
[00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.820]   For some, it is the realization that these are things that they've chosen for themselves,
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.280]   and that's not right.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.560]   By opening their hands, they realize, Lord.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.600]   Now I want to pray, Father, for the work of your conviction that leads us to repentance,
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.360]   that enables us to remove these things.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.680]   For some of you, that's a moment thing.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.320]   It's like that prayer sets you free.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.420]   For others, it may be a journey that the Holy Spirit is inviting you on.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.880]   Maybe to remove some of those clothes, it's going to take some time.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.640]   It's going to take some counsel.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.680]   It's going to take working with somebody who's going to pray with you and walk with you.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.320]   It's going to take some discipleship.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.560]   For some, it might be an immediate thing.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.560]   For others, there's a journey.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.080]   Whatever it is, today is the starting point of that for you.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.880]   It's just to say, "Lord, forgive me.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.960]   I recognize, Lord, that I've been wearing this.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   Forgive me.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   Help me, Lord.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:59.440]   I don't want to be naked, but I want to wear the clothes that you have called me to wear."
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:05.720]   And so part of that is that journey for you here now, to start to say, "This is the starting
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   point."
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:13.280]   I'm saying to you, Lord, prophetically, "I cannot go in these, but I don't necessarily
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.640]   know how to take it off."
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.680]   Maybe that's the honest prayer for some of you here today.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.840]   "Lord, I know I can't go forward, but Lord, I'm so used to wearing these things.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:24.720]   I'm not even sure what it would be like if I did take them off."
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:31.120]   I want you to know that the Holy Spirit is here present with you now to begin that journey
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:39.080]   with you, to lead you in a path of liberation and a new life.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.880]   Like the picture we had at the start, the book is open.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.600]   A new story is to be written.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:51.760]   You don't need to live the story of somebody else anymore.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   So just take your time.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:57.400]   I'm going to invite the team to just lead us in a time of worship, but just to take
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:02.800]   your time, whatever that might mean for you and however it is that you are to respond.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:08.400]   Just allow the Holy Spirit to continue to minister to you.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:09.400]   Thank you.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.400]   Amen.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   Amen.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:31.400]   Amen.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.160]   (ethereal music)
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:44.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
