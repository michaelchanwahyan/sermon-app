[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   But we also have sweatshirts and t-shirts and bracelets and things like that,
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.880]   also sporting my little branches of Hope Colors bracelet,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.560]   but we've got other stuff as well.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.400]   But beyond the bits and bobs that you can support us with,
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.760]   really what we're really hoping for is for people
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.080]   to walk alongside us in the long-term.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.560]   We really encourage you to scan the QR code, come check us out.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.520]   There's different volunteering opportunities,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.400]   especially when we have events and initiatives.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.120]   Summer school is a great example.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.800]   We always need volunteers to run summer school.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.680]   We've got a football tournament coming up at the end of October,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.240]   which needs hundreds of volunteers.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.040]   So, please do consider supporting us with your time and your effort.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.920]   But we also have a number of financial support initiatives
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   with which we are providing continuous support to the community on a monthly basis.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.960]   So, if it's on your heart, we would also love for you to
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.160]   prayerfully consider becoming a monthly donor.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160]   There's a number of initiatives that you can support.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.840]   One of them is for accommodation and utility support.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.920]   There's education support.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.480]   There's a number of different ways that you can support us on a monthly basis.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.480]   And honestly, it doesn't matter how much or how little you want to give.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.800]   I mean, give from where your heart is at.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.640]   But what I can guarantee you is that that goes straight to the community.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.800]   So, really a great way of walking alongside of them.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.960]   Anyway, I've taken enough of your time.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.760]   Sorry?
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.720]   It doesn't work. Oh, my goodness.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.600]   You have a bunch of QR codes over here.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.960]   So, do come and check us out afterwards at the booth.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.480]   See, this was just a ploy, right?
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.320]   To get you to come to the booth and scan us.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.960]   Marketing 101, you know.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.120]   But yeah, no, sorry for that.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.240]   But do come check us out.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.000]   Otherwise, we're very easy to find.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.600]   You can just go to branchesofhope.org.hk to get our website.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.720]   We're also on Instagram, Facebook, all the regular social.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.120]   So, you know, do come check us out.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.400]   And thank you again for giving us this platform.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.440]   Appreciate it.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.240]   [ Applause ]
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.280]   Sorry, just one thing I forgot.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.680]   I've been holding it the whole time.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.280]   This is our prayer guide that we've brought out just for Branch of Hope Sunday in Wan Chai.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.400]   This is actually really, really exciting because it allows you to, you know,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.240]   in addition to these things, really walk alongside the community in prayer, right?
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.880]   It's a six-week prayer guide.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.960]   We have three prayers for each of those weeks.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.920]   Each week has a different theme, a different topic.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.640]   So if you want to really explore this topic, if you want to really, you know,
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   offer your prayers for the communities that we serve, I really encourage you to pick
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.240]   up one of these guys.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.840]   You can make a little donation if you like for the prayer guide booklet.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.240]   And, you know, this is a great resource for community groups or even by yourself to go through.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.800]   So, yeah, just check these guys out.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.960]   Thank you.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.280]   - Thank you, Alex.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.200]   Now, Branches of Hope is one of the mission organizations our church partners with.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.640]   But the other mission organization that we partner with is YWAM Shanti,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.240]   and they're needing our help in their back-to-school drive.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.160]   Now, you can help out in a couple of ways.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.800]   One of the ways is that there are a list of items that you see on the screen right now.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.440]   Those are items that they need.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.840]   So if you have any of these items at home and you would love...that are in good quality,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.880]   and you would love to share with kids who may need them, these are some of the items
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.120]   that you can share.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.920]   The other thing that you can do to help with this event is you can act as a volunteer.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.480]   So this back-to-school drive happens on August the 27th from 10 to 5.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   So how this works is there will be different time slots where you can serve that day,
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.520]   and you can also help distribute some of these items that are donated to kids who
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.320]   need it for their school.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.080]   So if you want to sign up, you can contact Rebecca with that number on the screen right
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.240]   now, and you can do that to volunteer or to donate your items there.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.520]   So last year, I had the opportunity to serve at this day, and I thought it was a great
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.720]   way to kind of celebrate coming back from school and also to distribute some of these
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.280]   things to kids who need these things.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.640]   Sound good?
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.640]   Good.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.240]   Now, moving on to more giving, we also want to move into a time of worship with our giving
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.880]   of our finances and our resources.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.240]   So there are now buckets that are going around the room that you may give physically, and
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.040]   there are also digital ways that you may give appearing on the screen behind me right now.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.800]   We want to thank you for partnering with us and for your generosity for this church.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.760]   And yeah, worship is also our way of declaring that we trust in Jesus over our trust in our
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.920]   own resources.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.560]   So when the buckets are passed around, I will be back up here to pray for the offering.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:15.480]   Wonderful.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   Let us pray for the offering.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.160]   Father, you have blessed us with much financial blessings, relational blessings, spiritual
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.560]   blessings.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.480]   Lord, we thank you for these things.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.560]   And Jesus, as you have given to us abundantly, we want to humbly bring these back to you
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.880]   today.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.080]   You give us out of the overflow of your blessings, and Jesus may we also give out of the overflow
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.400]   of our blessings that we have received from you so that we may in turn bless others as
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.480]   well for the further rents of your kingdom here on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.480]   And we thank you, Jesus.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.400]   We pray this in your name.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   Amen.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Great.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   Wonderful.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.280]   Now, right now, I'd like to invite up Pastor Tim for the final time before he goes up for
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.000]   his sabbatical.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.880]   That's welcome, Pastor Tim.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.920]   You've heard of practice what you preach, and last time Tim was here, he preached on
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920]   rest.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.000]   And so, yeah, he's about to go on a bit of a rest.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.360]   Hey, Tim?
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.560]   Yeah, so why don't we all stretch our hands and pray for Tim as he closes this sermon
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.960]   series, Stewarding Our Lives.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.120]   Father, we are grateful for Tim.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.960]   We're grateful for all the hard work, all the things that he puts into this church,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.320]   all the things that, yeah, we may not notice as your normal person, but Lord, you see everything
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.840]   that Tim does, you see everything that he has placed upon this church, and therefore
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.080]   now, Jesus, I pray that as he delivers this message, as he closes this series of Stewarding
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.040]   Our Lives, Lord, that he may go off into just deep rest with you, Jesus, that he can meet
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.800]   you with you face to face in this rest, Lord, and that as he delivers this final message,
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.080]   it's been an important series for many of us as we look into how work is our worship
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.080]   to you.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.000]   And Lord, Jesus, I pray that today as we continue to look into this, Lord, may our
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.960]   work truly be glorifying to you as a form of our worship to you, Jesus.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   Amen.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.960]   Amen.
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   Thank you, Benedict.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960]   Let's give Benedict a hand.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   All right.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   Well, as Benedict says, final message in the Stewarding Our Lives series, and I'm wondering,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.320]   I don't know about you, but if you've been in church around for a while, it is likely,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:54.880]   it is possible that you've heard of this concept of bringing glory to God through your work.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.040]   So I'm just kind of curious who has heard somebody talk about that.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   All right.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.600]   So some people, not everyone.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   Okay.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   Good to know.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.860]   Now, for me, when I heard this the first time, or as I've heard this a few times in church,
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:19.960]   because I was thinking about my work experience, I wasn't quite sure how my work and how, like
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.040]   living for God's glory, how that fits together.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.320]   Now, I have to say this was also pre-pastor.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.320]   Okay.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:33.480]   But what I really was struggling, like, okay, here's this, I work, but how does it really
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.240]   relate to bringing God glory?
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.680]   Like, you know, how do these two fit together?
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.780]   Because to me, they don't seem like they fit together.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.840]   So for example, there was a season where I was a loan officer.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.800]   Yes, Mr. Officer.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:54.100]   I really am excited about that name, that title.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:09:00.880]   And so what I had to do in that job was, well, for one, sell mortgages to people, but that
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:09.200]   involved sitting 1.5 hours on average on the phone, waiting for a phone call to come in.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.680]   Waiting for a warm lead to come in.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.480]   Now, a warm lead is different than cold calling.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.920]   Basically what it involves is somebody already has done the cold calling, and then you get
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.640]   the person they found that is looking for a mortgage, that wants to get qualified to
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.600]   purchase a home in X amount of price.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.940]   And so waiting for 1.5 hours, like how does that connect with giving glory to God through
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.320]   my work?
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:40.640]   Now perhaps when you think about your job, you're also wondering about some of the things
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.880]   that you do and how they might connect.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.760]   Maybe it's not waiting for 1.5 hours for a phone call like it was for me.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.460]   But maybe as a parent, you're like, okay, it's 8 a.m. in the morning.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:58.080]   This is the third time I'm changing my children's clothes.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   Where's the glorifying God in that?
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:07.520]   Or maybe you have another pointless meeting that is on your agenda for the day.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.000]   And you're like, oh, my gosh, here we go again.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.120]   There's this famous book, it's called Death by Meeting.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.160]   Has anyone ever heard of that?
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.760]   Has anyone ever felt that?
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.320]   I think we felt that, right?
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.120]   I felt that for sure.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.420]   And then it might be maybe there's also this complicated person at work that's just making
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.500]   life really difficult.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.400]   And so when you think about your work, it's like, where is God in this work?
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.440]   And again, how does this concept of glorifying God and work, how does that all fit together?
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:46.800]   Now today in this message, I want to explore with you how we can give God glory through
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.120]   our everyday work.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.120]   And I want to explore with you what does that look like?
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.360]   How do you actually do that?
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.320]   So that's what we're going to unpack in this last message from the sermon series.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.520]   Now I hope that the stewarding our life sermon series has been helpful for you.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.760]   So according to Benedict, it's been helpful for him.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.480]   So that's good.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.200]   But really, our heart has been as we go through these different topics of our work, our calling,
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:23.560]   our struggles with work, idolatry in work, restorative justice through work, rest, that
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:33.200]   this one life that God has given us, that we can more intentionally, more faithfully
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.280]   live that out and pursue that as followers of Jesus.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.280]   And so that's been my prayer and my hope for you.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:47.040]   That this doesn't stop with us talking about it here, but that God is taking you deeper
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.640]   into his purposes for you in your everyday life.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   Amen?
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.640]   Amen.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   All right.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.240]   So we are today in the book of first Corinthians.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.080]   Today the context is a little bit complicated, so I need a little bit time to set it up for
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.080]   you.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.080]   Okay.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.760]   So Paul wrote a letter, the apostle Paul wrote a letter to the Corinthian church.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:14.720]   He planted the church and he received the letter while not being in Corinth anymore.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.360]   And in that letter, the Corinthians, he asked Paul questions that he then in part addresses
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.860]   through the letter of first Corinthians.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:30.100]   And so one of those questions has to do with food offered to idols.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.640]   So we have to take a step back and think about like, why did the Corinthians ask a question
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.200]   about food offered to idols?
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.240]   Well, they lived in a polytheistic environment.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:46.280]   They lived in a culture, in a town where idol worship was rampant.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.340]   And if you think about their lives, their family life, their social life, all of that
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.920]   - their work life as well - involved food.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.440]   But they're also the first generation of Christians, so they don't have Christians who have gone
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.160]   before them to give them guidance on what to do.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.720]   And they're actually disagreeing amongst each other on how to think about this.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:17.580]   And so Paul pastorally speaks into that, and it's actually for a very prolonged time because
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:23.160]   it starts in chapter 8 verse 1 and runs all the way to chapter 11 verse 1.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   Let me read all of it.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   Not going to read that much.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:34.680]   But what I want to do is I want to take you to the ending of his argument, where he talks
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.320]   about what it means to follow Jesus in this area of your life.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.840]   But at the end of the argument, he also expands it and widens it where it actually applies
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.000]   to more.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.760]   So let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 10, starting verse 31, and it says this.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.680]   So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:04.420]   Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks, or the church of God, even as I try
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.160]   to please everyone in every way.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:14.500]   For I'm not seeking my own good, but the good of many so that they may be saved.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:20.160]   Follow my example as I follow the example of Christ.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.600]   So let me unpack this for us.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:31.280]   So first we see in verse 31 that Paul talks about, so whatever you eat or drink or whatever
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.040]   you do, do it all for the glory of God.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   Now eating and drinking is like the most mundane everyday thing, you know, for most of us,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.540]   where it's part of our everyday life.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.980]   And so Paul is talking about everyday life things, but then he expands it, he even says,
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:56.020]   or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:03.580]   So that means that all our big moments in our day, all our small moments in our day,
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:10.740]   everything extraordinary in our day, everything very seemingly very minor are meant and our
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:17.740]   possibilities where we can live for the glory of God.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.820]   Now this is different than we often think about it, because a lot of times you think
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:29.860]   about it's the big things, the spectacular things where we can live for the glory of
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:36.700]   God, you know, when we have an influence on all of society or things like that.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:43.420]   But God, through Paul here, is calling the Corinthian church and everything you do, whatever
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.500]   you do, do it for the glory of God.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:54.460]   And so this really challenges our thinking, because that's not how a lot of us think about
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.940]   our daily work.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.820]   That's not how a lot of us think about waiting 1.5 hours on the phone for a phone call to
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.580]   be put through.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:10.100]   That's not how a lot of us think about seemingly pointless meetings, right?
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:16.100]   And so what Paul is saying to the Corinthians and what he's showing them is that our everyday
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:23.340]   life, as boring as it might seem, can be an arena where we can live in such a way that
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:28.900]   it brings God glory.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.700]   It means our everyday moments can be a place of worship.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.460]   Our everyday moments can be a place where we can experience God's presence, God's power
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.900]   at work in our lives.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.220]   Wow.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:49.460]   It's not, again, not usually how we think about those little moments, but this is what
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.280]   Paul is saying here.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.060]   So Paul is reframing how they think about these things, and he's also reframing that
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.820]   for us.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:04.300]   But now we need to talk about another part, because it says, "for the glory of God."
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.620]   This is also a phrase that people use a lot, but what does that actually mean?
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.900]   What does glory of God, what is this actually referring to?
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:20.620]   The word that Paul is using here in Greek is "doksa," which means glory and splendor,
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.700]   but really underlying his concept is the Hebrew term "kavod."
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:35.300]   And kavod means heaviness, weighty, burden, riches, reputation, importance, glory, splendor,
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.740]   distinction, honor.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:44.420]   And the idea behind kavod is that it's something important.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.420]   It is weighty.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.580]   It is significant.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:57.100]   And what that means is that God is so awesome because he is creator.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.500]   He's so awesome because of all that he does.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.620]   And when we stand in his presence, there's an impact.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.620]   We can feel it.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:13.620]   And in Israel, when the temple was built, God, when he filled the temple with his glory,
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.200]   with his presence.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.520]   So glory also has to do with God's presence.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.980]   And when we experience God's presence, it is just something that just puts us in awe
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.460]   and it's beautiful.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:39.740]   And so when we live for the glory of God, we're showcasing more fully who God is.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.380]   We're making his presence known.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.940]   But I want to actually take you to another verse in the Old Testament from Habakkuk.
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.180]   I only know how to say it in German.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.500]   I won't even try in English.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:59.860]   And Habakkuk, the prophet is saying that the world is heading to a time when there will
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.820]   be knowledge of the glory of the Lord.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:08.220]   So Habakkuk 2, verse 14 says this, "For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.980]   the glory of the Lord as waters covers the sea."
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.380]   Now what this means is that right now at this point in time, even though God's glory is
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:22.320]   everywhere, God is present everywhere, but we are not perceiving it.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.420]   People are not seeing it.
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.060]   They're not experiencing it.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.820]   They're not aware of it.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:32.420]   But one day, every person will have knowledge of the glory of the Lord.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.420]   They will see it.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.420]   They will perceive it.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.220]   They will experience it.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.380]   St. Benedict talked about the already, but not yet.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:47.020]   You know, so one day everyone will notice when Jesus comes again, when the kingdom is
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:54.920]   fully established, his glory, his presence, his beauty, his salvation will be fully known
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.180]   and fully visible to everyone.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.740]   To everyone.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:09.420]   Now bringing this back to Paul talking about, "Or whatever you do, do it for the glory of
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.540]   God."
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:20.620]   So what Paul is talking about here is that we are meant to make visible the things that
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.300]   are invisible right now to people, the glory of God.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:29.780]   We're meant to make visible, we're meant to make God visible by how we do our work, how
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:35.660]   we relate to others, what we say, and how we conduct our lives.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:46.340]   Know that when we image God, when we live out who we created us to be, we showcase who
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.140]   God is, his character, his beauty, his presence.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:58.020]   Our lives, they point beyond us and they point towards God.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:05.260]   And then the earth is starting to be filled more and more with the knowledge of the glory
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.820]   of God.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:14.120]   And so when we're talking about bringing God glory in our work, it means we're showcasing
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.120]   who God is.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.060]   We're making him known.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:24.660]   We're making his beauty, his presence more visible to people.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.900]   Because that's what that means.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:36.580]   But Paul, he further characterizes this in verse 33.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.500]   Let me show you.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:47.420]   He says this, "For I'm not seeking my own good, but the good of many so that they may
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.660]   be saved."
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:59.460]   So bringing God glory has also to do with seeking the good of others, with not just
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:06.220]   being focused on ourselves and our own self-interest, but putting the interests of others, having
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:12.140]   that impervi, putting that above ourselves for their sake.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:18.820]   That is also a way that people see the beauty, the wonder, and experience the presence of
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.020]   God when we do that.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.420]   And Paul modeled that with his life.
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.580]   He put others while being first murdered.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:32.460]   Paul gets this from God, from Jesus.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:40.900]   Philippians 2, right, it talks about that Jesus humbled himself, that he who had all
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:50.060]   the glory took on human nature, died on the cross for our sins so that we can be brought
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.700]   into the family of God.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   So he humbled himself and he thought of our well-being, of your and mine well-being so
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.500]   that we can be forgiven, that we can experience a relationship with God, that we can experience
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.340]   restoration, wholeness, healing.
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.340]   And he had that in view.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.740]   And so Paul is following his examples.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:26.640]   He wants us to follow his example so that we showcase the beauty of who God is.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:34.660]   And so we do that when you live for God's glory, you live for the good of others.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.900]   So we need to keep others in mind.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.740]   And the Corinthians were not doing that.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.980]   So Paul actually calls them out earlier on that, some of them, where they put their own
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.980]   interests first and it impacted others negatively.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.620]   But let's continue.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:24:01.140]   He further unpacks how our actions can enhance or also undermine other people's perception
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.420]   of who God is.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:09.060]   So in verse 32 and 33 says this, "Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks, or
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:15.460]   the church of God, even as I try to please everyone in every way."
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.580]   So Paul is not suggesting, when he talks about pleasing everyone in every way, he's not a
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:25.000]   pushover, he's not a doormat that you walk over and can do whatever to.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.140]   But what he's saying is he does not want to act in such a way that anything stands in
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:39.420]   the way hinders anyone from coming to know who Jesus is.
[00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:46.020]   From hearing the gospel message, he doesn't want to erect unnecessary barriers.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:50.340]   He doesn't want that to stand in the way, so he does anything that he can because he's
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:56.380]   thinking of others for that not to happen.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:01.900]   And so our actions and our choices, they can influence whether people are open to the gospel
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.940]   message or they can create obstacles.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:11.940]   So how we conduct our work, how we carry ourselves out, it can open up and spark interest and
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:18.260]   point towards God, towards his beauty, towards who he is, or it can undermine that.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:27.820]   And sadly, we all have experienced and we all have also done it to one degree or another
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:36.700]   where we've hurt others, where we have not enhanced the beauty of who God is through
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.660]   our actions.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:47.180]   But Paul is calling us by the grace of God, by his mercy, to continue and to progress
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:54.260]   in more and more and more consistently enhancing who God is, showcasing who God is.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:00.380]   And thank God that his grace is so much bigger than our failures, that even though barriers
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:10.380]   might have been erect, he can still overcome them because of who he is.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:20.720]   And then finally, Paul is saying, "Imitate me," in verse 11, "as I have imitated Christ."
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.620]   So it's again, follow the example of the self-giving love of Jesus.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:32.540]   That is really how you make God's glory known, how you make God visible when you follow that
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.980]   pattern.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:42.500]   But it really also speaks to me, could we say, "Follow my example"?
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:51.380]   Follow my example at work that I'm currently living out.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.180]   So maybe today there's also a call like, "Wow, what example am I giving?"
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.180]   And it's Jesus actually asking me to give a different example than I'm giving right
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.700]   now.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:05.280]   But this brings us all back to how can we bring God's glory through everyday life?
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.820]   What does that actually look like?
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:14.940]   First we need to see that our daily work can be a place to live for the glory of God.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.820]   A lot of times we have very dismissive attitudes actually towards our work.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.420]   It's a necessary evil to endure.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:27.140]   You know, I'm just trying to get out of here.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.860]   It's a means to an end, just got to make a living.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.860]   That's it.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:31.860]   I don't care about my job.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.260]   You know, it's just a means to an end.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.980]   But if we approach our work in this way, then how can we do whatever we do for the glory
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.600]   of God?
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.900]   You can't.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.100]   So we need a different mindset.
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.100]   We need a switch.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:54.660]   And so the first thing, if we want to start living that way, we need a switch in our mind.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:01.180]   That our workplace is a place where God is present, where God is at work, and where we
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.640]   can give him glory.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.820]   No matter how mundane it seems, no matter how frustrating it is, no matter how difficult
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:14.600]   it is, you know, it is a place where God is at work and where we can give him glory through
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.240]   how we engage in that place.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.380]   So that's the first thing.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:26.560]   Now the second thing is we glorify God through what we do and how we do it.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:37.500]   Now what we do, of course there are a few jobs that don't glorify God.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.140]   For example, if you're a loan shark and you're giving out predatory loans to people who are
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:47.140]   in need and then they're not able to pay them back and you just keep them in debt perpetually,
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.560]   you know, if you're in that type of job, you need a quickie job.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:57.140]   And so you need to discern, is your job a type of job that brings God glory just in
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.500]   its very own nature?
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:04.600]   But in the first message of the series, we talked about, you know, that we are created
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.400]   in the image of God.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.740]   And that part of what it means to be created in the image of God means to be cultivators,
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:17.520]   needs to be workers, that co-labor with God, that do creative work like God does creative
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:24.660]   work that create culture, that do beautiful things, that make pieces of art, that organize
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:30.380]   things that are not organized, that advance his project.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:40.300]   And when we focus on contributing to the flourishing of the world in general and the people specifically,
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.860]   you know, that brings God's glory.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:48.700]   And it doesn't matter if your job is a loan officer or if it's a pastor or whatever it
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:57.660]   may be, just by doing your job and serving people through it, you know, you are bringing
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.840]   God glory.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.020]   So that's the first thing.
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:07.860]   But then the second thing, and I think this signifies how we do our work.
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:15.340]   So when I was a loan officer, I could have like, "Ugh, hour and a half," you know, and
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.900]   then complain to my next, not next door, I guess, next best neighbor.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:25.300]   And we could just chit-chat the whole time and just see how miserable, you know, the
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.340]   work is.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.860]   But if I choose to have a positive attitude about what I do, it's okay, I'm waiting, maybe
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.540]   I can do some paperwork, I can do some other things.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.780]   I encourage my co-workers when we do chit-chat, you know, try to listen to them, lift them
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.020]   up, encourage them.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.020]   I work hard.
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.100]   You know, Christians really should be known for people who work hard, who do excellent
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:57.900]   work, that every employer wants to hire Christians because of how they carry themselves.
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:05.500]   And so when we do that, when we really seek to honor God through how we manage all these
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:11.900]   little details, how we deal with conflict in the work, you know, we give God glory.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:19.900]   And God, his beauty and who he is, is revealed to those around us.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.140]   We are making God visible in our workplace.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:32.860]   Now, I want to invite up Esther, so let's give Esther a warm welcome.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:40.620]   So Esther has been a part of our church community since we planted, and her husband Enoch is
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.220]   also one of the elders here, and she has two beautiful children.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.400]   And so we're so grateful to have you here today, and she's going to be sharing with
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:53.740]   us about her processing, her thinking about the glory of God and what that means through
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.740]   our work.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.740]   So thank you.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.740]   Thank you, Tim.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:57.740]   Thank you for inviting me.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.940]   So hi, everyone.
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.780]   So when I first started working, I was quite eager to serve God.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:11.180]   And that several years, I keep asking, "Hey, God, what can I do for you?
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.900]   And how can I bring glory to your name?"
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:21.740]   And for me, myself, I love art, and I heard about there is a one-year ministry program
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.820]   that using art to help people building God's community.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.180]   So I jumped in at the chance.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:36.540]   So it sounds very exciting, but at the same time, saying yes was not easy for me.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:44.100]   For that time, I had to quit my job and quite a steady income, and my boyfriend, not quitting
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.100]   him, just leaving him.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.140]   He's now my husband.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:52.700]   And everything familiar.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:58.900]   And I remember I still need to raise my own salary for that whole year.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:04.140]   And so I remember once I arrived, I was quite struggled.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:11.580]   It was like speaking different language and feeling out of place and even small things
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.340]   like cockroaches.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:19.860]   I have to face it alone, so I feel stretched in every way.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:26.980]   So at the end of that year, I sat down with a mentor to reflect the whole experience.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:32.400]   And during our prayer, I had a very clear vision that God gave me.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:39.780]   And he said, I saw myself sitting on his shoulder, and he was so big.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:44.660]   And just like he was standing there and showing me the city.
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.820]   We were looking out over the city.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.820]   And it felt like God showing me.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.460]   He even like hold me and show me, this is what I did.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:00.580]   And what he had been doing all along, like his work and his glory.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.140]   And then I was so excited.
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.580]   Like in that picture, I was so excited.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.940]   I was very joyful.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:16.780]   And I sense him saying that, even if you do nothing, I still love you.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.940]   So to be honest, I think this is comforting for everyone.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.980]   But at that time, I was upset.
[00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:28.300]   Hey, I thought, what do you mean?
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.140]   Like I have given up so much to be here.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:40.460]   But over time, I realized God was not trying to dismiss my effort, but he was inviting
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:48.220]   me to slow down, to notice and to appreciate what he was already doing.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:55.620]   He wanted me to witness his work and just focus, but not just focusing on my work, like
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.980]   it's his work.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:04.540]   So fast forward to this summer, now I'm working as a therapist.
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:12.100]   And when I know that I'm invited to share, and I think God reminded of this story, like
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:18.980]   one of my former teenage clients, and I have her consent to share her, like just part of
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.500]   her story.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.180]   And she had been struggled for a year with self-harm.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:32.340]   And she went through deep emotional struggles and breakdowns because of an abusive home
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.780]   and how she spent years unable to attend school.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:44.900]   So this year on DSE result day, you know, usually it's the mid of July.
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:50.980]   For your information, DSE is the Hong Kong public exam that helping you to get into the
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.300]   universities.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:59.700]   And I didn't expect anything from her, but she surprisingly sent me a message that she
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:05.300]   told me she doesn't even like able to attend school.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:12.340]   She even attend all the exams and complete the prep-tech examination with every subject
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.620]   passed.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.060]   And she's so proud of herself.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.740]   Yeah, I really want to give her a hand.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:25.220]   She's so proud of herself finding strength to live again.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.500]   That's what exact wording she said to me.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.540]   And when I received her message, I was deeply moved.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:38.180]   And because I witnessed her journey, like at that moment, I feel like, oh, I have a
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:45.300]   glimpse of the precious, beautiful strength of God had placed in her, like shining through
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:51.060]   all the brokenness she had faced and perhaps she's still facing.
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:58.540]   And that moment brought me to pause and simply be in awe of God's glory.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:05.740]   And on that result day, there are so many people looking for top grades, like big achievement.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:13.300]   I think those are also glory, but sometimes I think God's glory also shines through in
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:19.180]   this ordinary, like in this quiet moment of hope and strength.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:25.900]   So yeah, I think in the whole process, I'm remind glorifying God is just doing, about
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.940]   doing more, achieving higher.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.340]   I think there's no comparison is needed.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.580]   Everyone is different.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:40.420]   And sometimes it's just about pausing long enough to recognize God's presence and His
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.140]   work in every day.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:48.780]   So I hope we can all catch a glimpse of His glory even in the ordinary.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.780]   Thank you.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   Wonderful.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:58.940]   Thank you so much for sharing Esther.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:05.140]   I want to pick up on one of the things that Esther said.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.140]   And, you know, it's easy.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:13.220]   She was sharing about her own experience of trying to give God glory and then God, you
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.940]   know, putting her on her shoulder and showing her.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.460]   And that He just wanted her to see what He was doing.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:27.100]   Like now, of course, she can glorify God, but at that moment, He just also wanted her
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:34.540]   to enjoy the work that God was already doing and to behold His beauty and not to miss that
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:39.500]   herself as we're striving, you know, and are so focused on giving God glory.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:46.620]   And I think that's really important that, yes, whatever you do, do it for the glory
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.020]   of God, but don't miss God in it.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.020]   Right?
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:55.420]   See what He's doing, experience His presence, see His beauty, celebrate it, see it in other
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.980]   people's lives.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:07.700]   And it was interesting as I was thinking about giving God glory, I really have come to believe
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:13.140]   that a lot of times it's actually in the small, everyday, mundane things that we glorify God
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.140]   the most.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.620]   And I want to explain that a little bit.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.500]   First of all, there usually is no other agenda.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:26.740]   Like we're not trying to build a reputation for ourselves when it's a small, mundane thing.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.660]   We're just doing it because we love God and we're loving the people around us.
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:39.380]   And so there's a pureness in that, in these small, everyday moments when we choose to
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:46.340]   give God glory, when we choose to do work well, when we choose to be patient with somebody.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:54.660]   You know, these little things, they really honor Him and give Him praise.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:40:03.740]   And I was praying about myself, like, "God, how have I given you glory through my work?"
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:08.080]   And beforehand, I'll be honest, I thought about, I'll probably say something about the
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:14.100]   church plant, maybe about a sermon that especially seemed to have hit home.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:19.580]   But actually, as I was praying, the things that the Holy Spirit brought to my mind were
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.820]   the behind the scene moments.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:30.020]   It's like when I chose to obey God when nobody was watching, that He was glorified through
[00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.020]   that.
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:37.860]   I had to think of one particular instance.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:48.940]   And I'm not going to share much detail about this, but basically, I was entitled to something.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.380]   And I was praying over that, whether or not to do that.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:59.100]   And as I was praying, God spoke to me about that if I do that, it would impact other people
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.940]   negatively, even though I wasn't entitled to it.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.700]   And I had people in my life cheering me on, "Oh, you should do it.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.580]   It's yours."
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:16.620]   But I chose not to do it, which was very hard and came also at quite a high cost.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:19.340]   And only a few people know what this was about.
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.780]   Some Christians, some not Christian.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:29.460]   But that was the moment where I really felt God's joy and delight over me, that I glorified
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.540]   Him through what I did.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:39.940]   And it wasn't those behind the scenes, small moments, that He shapes us and molds us into
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:46.780]   people who reflect His character, who broadcast His beauty, who make visible through how we
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:52.140]   love, how we treat others, how we live our lives.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.340]   And that's what those everyday moments are.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:42:01.700]   If you're not giving God glory in those everyday little moments, you're missing out on this
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.820]   work that God wants to do in you and through you.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:10.900]   You're missing out on who God wants you to be and who He wants to shape you to be.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.380]   You're missing out on growing big people.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.820]   On imaging Him more fully, His character, His likeness.
[00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:25.340]   And so as I was thinking about bringing God glory through our work, I really felt like
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.460]   that this was God's invitation to us here today as a church.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:38.980]   That He is inviting you or calling you back to give God glory in those small, everyday,
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:46.260]   mundane moments that maybe don't seem big, but that God will work through it, that He
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:53.220]   will make Himself known, that the knowledge of the glory of God will increase because
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:59.940]   you everyday faithfully are choosing to bring Him glory, whether somebody's watching or
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:00.940]   not.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:01.940]   And guess what?
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:07.500]   When those supposedly big moments come, because of what you've been doing, you're that type
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.100]   of person who will bring God glory.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.640]   Because that's the trajectory you're on.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.900]   And that's what He is calling to and inviting you to.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.420]   I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:29.580]   I had the, sorry, I need to blow my nose.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:32.460]   Yeah, I do.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:42.380]   I had to sense that some of us, maybe like Esther, we had this gung-ho phase in our lives.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.380]   We're like, "I'm going to live and work for the glory of God."
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:53.180]   But for whatever reason, that somehow got lost along the way.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:58.980]   And I just sensed that today God wants to invite you to renew your heart, to restore
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:08.140]   your heart, to not be cynical, to not underestimate what He wants to do through small and mundane
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.140]   moments.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.980]   So I want to invite you to stand.
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:21.420]   And I would love to pray for you.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:28.380]   And if that's a desire of your heart, you're like, "Lord, I just want to give you glory
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.860]   through those small, mundane, everyday moments."
[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.900]   Just as a symbol of that, it's like, "Here I am again," or, "Here I am for the first
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.900]   time.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   I never thought about it."
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.740]   I just want to invite you to stretch out your hand before you.
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.620]   I would love to pray over you.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:57.180]   Jesus, I thank you so much that you have created us and that you've called us to be people
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:08.980]   who love like you love, who showcase your character so that others who don't know you
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:15.780]   can just see how beautiful, how amazing, how incredible you are.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:22.980]   And I thank you for every heart right now that is expressing, "Lord, I want to serve
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.460]   you."
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:29.100]   I don't care if it's like the big moments or if it's the small moments.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.880]   I just want to bring you glory.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.020]   I just want to honor you, whether people are watching or not.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:47.020]   And Lord, and so I pray that you will powerfully make yourself visible in everyone's life,
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.740]   that we can see you in our workplace.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:54.620]   Maybe we can see you in those places that we felt like are just mundane and dumb and
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.860]   we just want to get away from them, but that they actually are places where you are at
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:04.980]   work, at work in our lives and at work in other people's lives.
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:09.580]   And so Lord, so we surrender and we say, "Holy Spirit, come.
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.020]   Will you fill our hearts?
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.900]   Will you renew our hearts?
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:14.900]   We've grown old.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.420]   We've grown cynical.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.220]   We've given up.
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.220]   Will you restore us?
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.820]   Will you do a new thing?"
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:31.820]   And Lord, I pray now over everyone that as we go out this week, as we choose to bring
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:38.380]   you glory in the small little things every day, that because of that, you will make yourself
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:43.740]   known, that you will shine brightly through this community, that more people will come
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:51.060]   to knowledge of your glory because you have faithful followers of you just loving you
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:56.180]   in the little things, loving you in the behind the scenes things.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:02.460]   And so we offer our lives to you, Jesus, we say, "Use us for your glory."
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:06.980]   And church, we all say to this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   Amen.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:08.500]   Thank you.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.500]   [MUSIC]
