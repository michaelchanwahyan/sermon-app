[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   Everybody says, "Amen, Amen."
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.680]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.680]   Welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.760]   If you're relatively new with us, my name is Andrew.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.080]   I'm one of the pastors here and it's so great to have you here.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.480]   I was just sensing as you were worshiping as well, I wonder if anybody's just arrived
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.160]   in Hong Kong.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.360]   Maybe you're new to the city.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.960]   Maybe you've come in in the last week or two or month and you're settling into Hong Kong.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.960]   It's totally new for you.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.920]   Maybe you have your family, maybe you're on your own.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.160]   Maybe works brought you here or for some reason you're in the city.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.280]   If that's you, would you just put your hand up?
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.280]   You're new to Hong Kong.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.280]   Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.320]   In the upper house, put your hand up if you're new.
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.320]   All right, awesome.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.320]   Here's what I want to do.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.320]   I want to just take a moment.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.840]   If you're new to Hong Kong, I just want to say this.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.640]   There's amazing great churches in our city, lots of great churches in our city.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.240]   And even if you're new, we encourage you to get out there and experience and to get, you
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.560]   know, to see some of the churches in our city.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.680]   But every single church in here in Hong Kong would say the same thing.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.360]   You are not in Hong Kong by mistake.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.740]   I'm biased because I've lived here for 40 years.
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.320]   But God is doing something in this city, I think that is unprecedented.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.300]   And you're a Christian, you're a believer, and you've been brought to this city.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.640]   And I believe the Lord is about to light a fire in you.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.160]   I believe that you came here for work, and work is awesome, and there's lots going on
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.640]   in your work, and that's great.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.400]   But I believe that you're in this city for something far greater than what you're doing
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920]   Monday to Friday.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.360]   I believe that you're here because the Lord is actually bringing the sheep, the community
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   that he needs in his city for this time.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.480]   And so you bring gifts, you bring heart, you bring life, you bring experience that the
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.360]   church of Hong Kong desperately needs in this season.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.760]   You are not here by mistake, amen.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.240]   So if you're new here, I want to do a brief thing.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.920]   Could you just stand if you're new to Hong Kong?
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.520]   You just put your hand up, I'd love you just to stand.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.520]   Could you stand with me?
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   Come on.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   Upper house, lower house, come on, stand.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.400]   Yes.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.640]   All right.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.880]   Everybody else, everybody else, could you just stretch out your hands towards these
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   people?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   Can we pray for them?
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   Let's just pray.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.160]   Lord, we want to pray right now.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400]   Lord, we welcome these guys to Hong Kong.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.840]   Hong Kong is not necessarily an easy place to fit into sometimes.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.720]   Lord, it's crazy.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.040]   There are lots of things happening, crazy work hours.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.560]   It's an expensive place to live.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.120]   Lord, we want to pray first of all for each of these people that they would just logistically,
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.520]   relationally, emotionally, that they would adapt to Hong Kong, that you would enable
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.680]   them to find their feet quickly.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.800]   So Lord, we thank you that you've sent them.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.760]   And Father, you have sent them to this city.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.480]   These are the sent ones in this season.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.880]   And so Father, we recognize that they bring and they carry with them gifts and anointing
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.480]   and heart that Hong Kong needs, that this church community needs, that our city needs.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.760]   And we want to pray now that you would release a fresh anointing over these ones.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.720]   Lord, you have brought them into this city, this fragrant harbor for this season.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.840]   And Lord, I want to pray that your spirit, Lord, would just enable them.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.720]   Where they're homesick, that you would meet them and that you would speak life into them.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.120]   Lord, where they're beginning to get settled, that you would enable them to put roots down.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.440]   And Lord, I want to release a new season.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.320]   I see oil being poured out upon you.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   I want to pray that the oil of Jesus for this season, the anointing that he has for you,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.900]   would fall upon you and that you would be able to work in the workplace, build relationships,
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.880]   do the things that you do, get connected to community, get connected to a church in a
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.420]   way that will flourish you and flourish Hong Kong.
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.980]   We are so glad that you are here.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.080]   And we pray this in Jesus' name, everyone says.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   Amen.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   Welcome everyone.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   Welcome.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.880]   By the way, by the way, we don't do that every week.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.400]   So that was special for you.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   I'm excited.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.480]   I'm so grateful for Pastor Ellison and just this summer series that we've been in, the
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.080]   book of James.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.120]   And then for Phil and for Ellison that have taught and preached in this series so far
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.280]   to this point, Phil brought a great message on that typhoon Sunday.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.680]   It felt so fab to Phil that he couldn't be here to deliver it in person, but a great
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.800]   message on the idea of pure religion.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.280]   What does pure religion look like?
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280]   And really that's the heart.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   That's the thesis for James throughout this whole letter is how do we understand what
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.840]   it is to be purified in the relationship that we have with our father through Jesus?
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.360]   And so that was week one.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.400]   Week two, Ellison brought a powerful word around faith and deeds last week.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.280]   And what does it mean to wrestle with the idea that we don't just profess a belief,
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.880]   but that actually changes and impacts the way in which we live.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.440]   And I want to kind of build on that a little bit as we move into the third chapter of James
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.920]   here this morning.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.800]   And we look at a topic that I think is very central to James's heart for the people that
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   he's writing to.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.380]   Remember, he's writing to a community of people that are facing persecution, facing hostility
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.640]   for their faith and their environment, facing division amongst themselves, trying to settle
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.760]   in to what it means to be community together.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.720]   And in the third chapter, the heart of his letter, in chapters one and two, James has
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.440]   been pretty direct.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.280]   It's almost been like he's been a little bit strong.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.800]   You know, he's been like a little bit of a tell you off for all the things.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.080]   But by the time he gets to chapter three, this pastoral heart for James comes out.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.680]   And when I read James and I get into the flow of his arguments and then I come into chapter
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.600]   three, it almost sounds like James is like kind of just hushing down a little bit.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.680]   He's wanting his community just to take a moment, take a breath.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.000]   And he starts, we'll see this in a moment, but he starts a chapter and he says, "I want
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.040]   to talk to you now about something that we all struggle with."
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.400]   It's like this beautiful pastoral moment.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.580]   He's kind of like slapped them around a bit, chapters one and two.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.200]   But in the third chapter, he's like, "I want to just express my heart for you guys."
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.320]   He says, "I struggle with this, you struggle.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.920]   We all struggle with this thing."
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.720]   And in the chapter, he speaks about the power of words.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.400]   He speaks about what comes out of our mouths.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.960]   He speaks about the way in which we use our tongue, our language and our words.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.200]   And I think it's important to James because I think James sees the much bigger picture.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.840]   I think he sees the reality of what God has done in creating human beings to be able to
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.840]   communicate.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.920]   I don't know if you've thought about it this way, but our words and our language and our
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.640]   communication is the secret ingredients that aligns ourselves to either be able to draw
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.440]   closer to one another or actually to push each other apart.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.680]   I don't know if you've thought about it that way, but essentially your words, your ability
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.280]   to communicate is the process by which you as a human being can do the one thing that
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   every human being desires for the most, and that is intimacy.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.200]   We are literally created for relationship, created for intimacy.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.120]   And it is our communication, the way in which we speak that brings that into our lives.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.440]   So in those seasons where we speak well and we speak life and we offer words of encouragement
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.720]   and love and we connect well with people, we draw close and we are more intimate with
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.760]   the people around us.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.320]   But likewise in those moments of life where we argue, where we slander, we gossip, we
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.880]   find like stuff's not going down well and we communicate in ways that are rough or harsh,
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.600]   we find ourselves at enmity with the people around us, pushing away from the people around
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.240]   us.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.960]   The actual word communication has an etymology that just basically means the roots within
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.240]   it and communication, the etymology of that is community.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.800]   And the etymology of community is communion.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.280]   Communion is this idea of drawing close and being intimate.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:56.320]   We just shared in what we call within the church world the communion table, the place
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.560]   through the bread and the cup where we join in deeper relationship and intimacy with the
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.360]   forgiveness of Christ and the power of his resurrection.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.240]   So communion forms out of community which is created by our communication.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.420]   So if we want greater communion with God and with one another, our communication is important.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.080]   When that goes wrong, community breaks and when community breaks, it is a struggle to
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.720]   find communion.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:27.960]   So when you think about the reality that God has literally created you for communion, for
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.840]   intimacy, then your communication is central.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.680]   In other words, words really matter.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.480]   Like they really matter.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.320]   Not just because God wants you to be a nice person.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.640]   In fact, when you look at this chapter that we're going to unpack together today, the
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.920]   temptation is to think really what James is just saying is, you know, change your behavior
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920]   a little bit.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.040]   Like just try to say some nicer things.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.960]   But that's not at all what James is interested in.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   He's not interested in some sort of behavior modification.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.800]   What James is interested in is helping all of us to understand the breadth and the beauty
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.920]   of what God has done in this world and how that impacts us and our words that we speak
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:16.740]   either align ourselves to the beauty and the wonder of God's kingdom or they dramatically
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.600]   take us away.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.160]   And you can sense this pastoral heart of James leaning out to his church, quietening his
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.720]   voice and saying, "We're in this together.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:36.520]   I wonder whether we could together come truly, fully alive."
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.040]   So what I want to do with you here this morning is take you on a bit of that journey through
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.520]   what James is teaching.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:48.380]   My prayer is that each one of us by the end would feel like there's a way for us to become
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.240]   more alive, more the way that He has created us to be and to recognize that it's not about
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.360]   trying to say some nicer things, but it's about understanding that the way in which
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:08.240]   we've been created to be means that the words out of my mouth can bring life.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.560]   So let me show you this from James chapter 3.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   We're going to start in verse 2.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.400]   He actually speaks about words in three of his chapters because that's how important
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   it is to him.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.080]   So let me just start chapter 3, verse 2.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080]   This is this.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.280]   He says, "We all stumble in many ways."
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.520]   Isn't that a beautiful pastoral way to start?
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.740]   Like he's not starting like, "I've got three things I want to beat you around the head
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.120]   on today."
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.120]   He starts by saying, "I'm in this boat with you.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.560]   We're in this boat together.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.360]   We all stumble in so many ways."
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.760]   He says, "If any person is never at fault in what they say, they are a perfect person
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.160]   able to keep their whole body in check."
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.400]   He's like, "Man, if you could get yourself, if you could be perfect in this, this is an
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   amazing thing.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   But here's the thing we all stumble with.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.480]   See, when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.440]   animal or take ships as an example.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.400]   Although they are so large and driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder,
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.440]   whichever way the pilot wants it to go.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.200]   Likewise, the tongue.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.080]   It is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.080]   Sure, what a great forest is set on fire by such a small spark.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.000]   The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.240]   It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of their life on fire, and is itself
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.800]   set on fire by hell.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:38.080]   All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.000]   by people, but no person can tame the tongue.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.480]   It is a restless evil full of deadly poison.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.800]   And he says this, this is what we do.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.880]   With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who have been
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.880]   made in God's likeness.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.880]   Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.640]   My brothers and sisters, this should not be.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.880]   Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.600]   My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives?
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.720]   Can a grapevine bear figs?
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.160]   Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.200]   It's really beautiful here what James is trying to lean into his church.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.240]   He's like, don't you understand that there's this reality that we all stumble with when
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.480]   we all struggle with these words.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.960]   And he gives us three pictures to help us to see this.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.240]   He talks about the bit that's placed in a horse's mouth.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.000]   He talks about a rudder that's on a ship and how it steers.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   But the one I want to dig into a little bit is the third image he gives us.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.960]   And it's of a spark that brings a fire to a whole forest.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.280]   And he talks about how this tongue is like a fire that is set on fire.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.200]   And then he goes all the way to the end of that passage.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.400]   And he says, it's like it's burning, like the burning of hell.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.380]   And he uses this word that we translate into the English as hell.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:58.120]   And when we, in our time, read that word, we immediately think of the opposite of heaven.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.920]   We think that James is literally saying that the tongue can bring us into a place of hell
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.760]   as in this like eternal damnation away from heaven.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.360]   But actually, James is not using the word hell here.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.680]   That's the word we translate.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.600]   He's actually naming a place that the Greek word here is the word Gehenna.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.920]   And Gehenna became the theme of which the New Testament begins to speak of the idea
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   of hell.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.360]   But in this moment, James is speaking about a place.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   He's naming a place that the people he's writing to would know about quite well.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.760]   Gehenna was about 50 miles south-southwest of Jerusalem.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.680]   And throughout the whole history of Israel in their land, it was a significant place.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.360]   In the Old Testament times, there were tribes that lived in the area of Gehenna.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.320]   Gehenna interestingly was a forest.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:54.160]   So notice in this part, he says a small spark that sets fire to a whole forest.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.520]   Gehenna was a forest area.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.760]   Now what happened in the Old Testament times is that the tribes that lived there worshipped
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.840]   a God called Malak.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.400]   And Malak, the way they worshipped him, and this is horrible, trigger warning, but the
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.700]   reality, they worshipped him through the sacrifice of children.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:17.200]   And the way they would do that is they would build a fire, a bonfire, and then the child
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.720]   that was to be sacrificed was placed on the bonfire and was literally burned to death.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.320]   This was the worship to this Malak that was happening in that place.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.360]   Now, by the time James is writing, Gehenna has long stopped that practice.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.880]   But because of that, that land was always seen as cursed.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:41.480]   It was a place of great fire before where the worst of humanity took place, the evils.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.600]   If you could think about it, what's the worst thing that humanity could do?
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.120]   Somebody taking their child and burning them in this fire.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.520]   Well, this is what Gehenna represented.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.840]   Now in James' time, they're not doing that anymore, but here's what happened.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.400]   All of the rubbish, all of the stuff from Jerusalem that was rubbish was sent down to
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.920]   Gehenna and was burnt there.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.320]   So fires within this forest were still happening, and the stench of that on the wrong day, of
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.800]   the wind was blowing the wrong way, could still reach into Jerusalem.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.440]   It was a place that represented the stench of the worst of humanity.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.780]   Now follow James' argument here.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:26.060]   He's talking about the tongue, and he's comparing the tongue in the mouth to the horrors of
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.620]   the reality of what happened in the past in Gehenna.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.020]   And he says literally like this, "You've got to understand that this is what the tongue
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.300]   can do.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:42.940]   It can create a reality in which the worst of human choices become true."
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.740]   Are you following?
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.500]   This is the seriousness of what James is trying to talk to the church about.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.740]   Your tongue can, if not controlled, be like Gehenna.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:03.940]   It can actually create a situation where the worst of human choices become a reality.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:10.220]   So for James, right up front, our tongue, what we speak, and the reality of something
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.140]   created come together.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.660]   Are you following this?
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.660]   Now it's important that you see this link, because ultimately what James is trying to
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:22.980]   do is kind of bring the church to a much bigger picture of what's happening in Scripture
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.180]   around this idea of speaking and creating.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.460]   In fact, in verse 11, he speaks about the source.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.400]   He says, "Can fresh water and salt water come together and be in the same thing?
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.900]   Can you have two sources creating two different things?"
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.900]   He's like, "No, no, no, no.
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.460]   There's only one source."
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.300]   So to understand really what James is trying to teach about this fact that our tongue can
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.980]   create realities that would express the worst of what humanity can do, you have to take
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.940]   him all the way back to the source.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.460]   I want to show you some things here from the source of our words.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.580]   Of course, to do that, you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the biblical
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.580]   story.
[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.180]   Let me read you just the first three verses of Genesis.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.540]   Genesis 1, verses 1 to 3.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.980]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.920]   Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the deep,
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.740]   and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:24.460]   Verse 3, "And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light."
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.700]   This is one of the most wonderful moments.
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:32.280]   I wonder if you've ever asked yourself, why does God use words to create?
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.620]   Why does it specifically say here that God said He spoke, the Hebrew word here meaning
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.820]   literally out loud, He spoke out loud, "Let there be light," and there was light.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.820]   Think about this.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.140]   There was no one around right now in creation to hear it.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.140]   Come on, church.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.740]   Like no one had been created yet.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.380]   There were no animals, no things, no people.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.700]   That all comes later.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.420]   No one is there to hear it, so why didn't He think creation into being?
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   Like what was the point?
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.020]   What was the purpose of Him speaking?
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.380]   God is trying to show us that there is a reality through the way in which He's created the
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380]   words.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:12.860]   So He stands over creation, and He speaks to this formless void, and He brings it into
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.100]   creation.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:21.540]   The Hebrew word that is found in the Old Testament that we translate to word in English is "dabba."
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:27.420]   And "dabba" literally in the Hebrew can mean a word, or it can mean a thing.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.740]   And those two things seem quite different.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.300]   Like is it a word, or is it a thing, like a real thing?
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:39.020]   Well, the reason why it can mean both is because in the Hebrew concept of the idea of a word,
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.460]   words have material reality to them.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.660]   This is different for us and how we think about it these days, because when we think
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.100]   about words, we just think about things that are spoken out of somebody's mouth or something
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.500]   written on a page.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.660]   The Hebrews didn't think of it that way.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:59.980]   Because God created with His Word, the way they saw it is that God "dabbared" creation.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.340]   Words, in other words, have material reality to them.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.940]   They can literally create something.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.860]   And this idea of the Hebrew concept of "dabbar" is found throughout our scriptures.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.900]   Have you ever heard someone say, "Man, when they talked, their words had weight."
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.940]   That's the Hebrew idea of the concept of "dabbar."
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:26.020]   When I was 15 years old, I decided to try out for the local play that was happening
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   in my school.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.780]   I'd never done any drama before.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.940]   I'd never thought about doing drama, but I needed to get a few extra things on my resume.
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.340]   So I decided I was going to be in the drama.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.500]   So I went along for the audition.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.820]   The drama teacher was like, "Why are you here?"
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:40.820]   And I'm like, "Hi."
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.340]   And he's like, "Okay, well, here's what you need to do."
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.740]   And he said, "I'm going to put a mirror on the front of the stage, and then you're going
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:51.860]   to get up, and I want you to mime for five minutes the mirror and your interaction with
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.060]   the mirror."
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.660]   So I was like, "Okay."
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.060]   So I got up on stage, and there was the mirror, and I went up, and I started interacting with
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.020]   the mirror, and I did all these things, and I tried my best.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.840]   It probably wasn't the greatest thing that had ever happened.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.500]   But as I put down the mirror at the end of the five minutes, I just stood there, and
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   he didn't say anything.
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.820]   He just sort of stared at me for a while.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.060]   And I was a little bit worried to begin with.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.940]   He was like just staring me down.
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.100]   And then he said these words.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:24.700]   He said, "What you just did made me come alive."
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:30.380]   I wonder if you can imagine for a 15-year-old kid, for somebody who's in authority, to say
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.020]   something like that over them.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.300]   And I remember in that moment thinking to myself, "That's what I want to do for the
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.260]   rest of my life."
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:48.100]   Not drama, because I'm not great at drama, but I want to help people come alive.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:53.180]   That man didn't know it, but he debarred on me in that moment.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.420]   A word out of his mouth gave this 15-year-old a calling for the rest of his life.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:06.620]   And ever since that day, I have been dedicating my life to helping people come alive.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.060]   This is the Hebrew concept of debar.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.180]   Our words have weight and material reality to them.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.100]   Now notice what happens next as God creates humanity.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.220]   And God said, "Let us make humanity in our image, in our likeness.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.980]   Let them rule over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, over the livestock, over
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.540]   all the earth, over all the ground, and the creatures among them on the ground."
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.860]   So God created humanity in his own image.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.060]   In the image of God, he created him.
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.220]   Male and female, he created them.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.940]   Notice, "God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.460]   Fill the earth and subdue it.'"
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:47.660]   And then as we get down to verse 31, it says, "God saw all that he had made by speaking,
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.060]   and it was very good."
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:55.280]   I want you to see something really important here, because in God's creation of humanity,
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.380]   God shows us the process by which his words are created, by which he debars in this world.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:10.460]   Notice, God speaks, he creates, he then blesses, and then finally he pronounces good.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.460]   And you'll see that rhythm throughout all seven days of creation, but it's right there
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.980]   at the moment when God creates humanity.
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.980]   He speaks, he creates, he blesses, and he pronounces good.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.100]   Now here's what happens next.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.420]   God has created humanity, and he says these words.
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.940]   He says, "You are my image on earth," which means a lot of different things, but in this
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:38.020]   case, it means that you are able also to image, to be and partner with me.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.660]   Remember, he says to humanity, "Go into the world, bring it to flourishing, help the world
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.100]   to grow and to flourish, subdue it and bring it to life."
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.740]   So here's humanity doing that.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.540]   Now guess what happens first?
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.140]   Here's the first way God shows Adam and Eve to do that.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.840]   He takes Adam, and he says to Adam, "I want you to name the animals."
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:02.220]   Have you ever wondered why God asked Adam to name the animals?
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.780]   It's because God is saying, "The first thing I want humanity to do is debar."
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.100]   Are you following this?
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:14.060]   I want you to speak the name, name in the Hebrew being character.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.900]   I want you to describe, I want you to tell the animals who they are.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.900]   That's essentially what he's asking Adam to do.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.540]   Tell the animals who they are.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.660]   So there's Adam, and this weird creature comes before him, and he looks at the creature,
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.460]   and he sees the tail, and he sees the big mane of hair, and he goes, "Lion."
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.740]   Are you with me?
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.140]   Because Adam does not think lion.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.480]   Adam speaks the word.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.100]   He names the animal.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.660]   Lion, giraffe, alligator, whatever it was, whatever came before him, whatever the Lord
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.700]   brought to him, he spoke out.
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:52.780]   And in speaking out, he debarred on that animal its character, its nature, its identity, what
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.780]   it is.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.820]   He gave it its name.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:24:00.340]   God is creating a structure where he creates, he speaks, he creates, he blesses, and everything
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.620]   is declared good.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:08.020]   We then get to speak, we get to create, we get to bless, and we get to bring world into
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.780]   a flourishing that is very good.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.340]   Are you following this?
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.500]   But then, thousands of years later, James writes to the church, and he says, "It's all
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.980]   hell.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.300]   Like it's all burning.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:27.980]   Like what's coming out of our mouths is setting everything on fire, and not in a good way."
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.860]   So the question we should have is, what happened?
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:36.020]   Because if it was created to be a certain way, and then James is saying, "It's not like
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.620]   that anymore."
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:41.300]   What in the world happened?
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.460]   Well notice what it says in Genesis 3, starting in verse 1.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.860]   Is this helpful so far?
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.540]   I'll get back to James in a moment, trust me.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.660]   But we flow together through what the Scriptures are saying.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.380]   Notice what it says in Genesis 3, verse 1.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.640]   Now the serpent, the snake, this is representative, this is enemy, this was Satan.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.420]   Now Satan was more crafty than any of the wild animals that the Lord had made.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.860]   He said to the woman Eve, he said, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:07.860]   in the garden.'"
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.300]   I want you to see something very important that happens here that again, we often miss
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   over.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   First of all, Satan, as he's thinking about, "How do I convince humanity to be changed?"
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.540]   He doesn't try to convince their thoughts.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.900]   He doesn't try to influence their emotions.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.060]   Here's how Satan does it.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.420]   He speaks.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.660]   So he speaks over Eve.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.600]   The snake in the tree opens its mouth and speaks words.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.300]   And he says this, notice what he says, "Did God really say?"
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:42.980]   So the first thing that the enemy does is try to attack the structure of God speaking,
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.340]   God creating, God blessing, God bringing good.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.560]   Did God really say all of this stuff?
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.500]   And suddenly here's Eve and Adam, and they're beginning to get confused.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.860]   They're beginning to go, "Hang on a sec now, what do we believe?"
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.060]   Because there's a new voice in the world.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.620]   Are you seeing this?
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.540]   There's a new debar that is taking place.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:07.580]   Satan is speaking and trying to now get Adam and Eve to believe and to think in a different
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.580]   way.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.560]   And now Adam and Eve are caught between these two narratives that are at play.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.280]   Will they align themselves to the wonder of the Lord in the debar of Him, or will they
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.380]   now align themselves to the trickery and the destruction of the enemy?
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:29.420]   And here's what they do, in choosing the fruit from that tree, in deciding to take on that
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:35.980]   and to believe and adhere to Satan, they change from adhering to one way of being and speaking
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.580]   to now aligning with another.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.220]   And here's what Satan does.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:46.640]   Satan speaks, Satan destroys, Satan curses, Satan pronounces death.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.700]   So see these two things side by side right here.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.800]   And all of this is sort of saying, all of this is driven by what comes out of the mouth.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   And here's the thing, which of these two are we going to align our lives with?
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.020]   This is why for James, this is not about some behavior modification.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.460]   It's not like, "Hey, just try to be a nicer person in the world."
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:09.780]   Like this is James saying, "Don't you understand what you've been created for, how the world
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.860]   is structured, and you are either one of these things or you're the other."
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:14.860]   This is very important.
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.300]   James is essentially saying to the church, "There are no neutral words."
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.580]   Come on, church.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.920]   Your words out of your mouth, they're either aligning yourself to what God is doing and
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.660]   brings blessing and life, or your words are aligning to the work of the enemy and you're
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.600]   bringing death and destruction.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.100]   There's no middle ground.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.380]   There's no Genesis 3b.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:38.820]   It's Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.800]   And then we're on a journey for redemption through Jesus Christ.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.780]   There's a red pill and a blue pill.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.780]   There's no other pill.
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:50.100]   This is a matrix reference for any of you who are my age.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.340]   There's no neutral words.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:55.140]   James wants his church to know.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:01.780]   You're either this or you're that, and this, he says, is the issue.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.380]   Notice what he says at the start.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.460]   "We all struggle with this."
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:14.060]   So the question is, how do we align more to that side than that side?
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:21.660]   Well, when the disciple John is sitting down to write his version of the gospel, and he
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.660]   thinks, "How do I start to help people to understand who Jesus is?"
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.060]   Notice the words he says, John 1, verse 3.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.220]   "In the beginning was the word."
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.220]   There it is.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.220]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.780]   So in the beginning, he's saying, "was the deba."
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.380]   Now the word he's using here, it's not the Hebrew word, of course, because he's writing
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.380]   in Greek.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.540]   It's not logos, but it links to that deba idea in the Hebrew.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:49.940]   "And the word was with God, and the word was God, and he was with God in the beginning.
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.460]   Through him all things were made.
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.260]   Without him nothing was made that has been made."
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:59.560]   And then if you jump down to verse 14, it says, "The word became flesh and made its
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.700]   dwelling amongst us."
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.860]   So there's this beautiful thing.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.420]   Here's John trying to describe Jesus.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:10.700]   He's like, "You've got to understand that Jesus is the culmination of what every deba
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.460]   of God looks like."
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.340]   Like if you were to take a human being, one who was able to live every word and promise
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.340]   of God, and everything that came out of his mouth was a blessing and not a curse, it would
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.480]   be Jesus.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.420]   He is the word of God.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.900]   The fullness of creation is within him.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.020]   He was the one who was there, speaking at the beginning, creating it all in the first
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.980]   place, and literally, John will go on to say this, "Through his death, life, and resurrection,
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.900]   you yourself can become a new creation.
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.420]   You yourself can be made new."
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:44.120]   There is great hope in that, but you have to understand the starting point.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.580]   You want to understand who Jesus is?
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.580]   He's the deba of God.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.580]   God's word made flesh.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:54.460]   That's deba, materiality.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.460]   God speaks.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.460]   Jesus is.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:04.140]   In the fullness of that, it's quite interesting, because I love this phrase, "And the word
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.940]   became flesh."
[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.980]   Now follow with this.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:16.180]   There is only ever one time where the fullness of the word of God became flesh, and that's
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.180]   Jesus.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.940]   But I think words become flesh all the time.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:27.140]   I bet every single person in here can probably testify to a moment where someone said something
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.580]   over you, spoke a word to you, maybe in a season in your life in the past, maybe when
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.220]   you were young as a child, maybe it's even somebody in the office recently, someone's
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:42.140]   said something to you, and it's deeply disrupted you, and it's deeply hurt, and that word begins
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:48.300]   to take on flesh, and that flesh becomes you.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.220]   Maybe someone said to you, "You're not good enough.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.140]   You're not good enough."
[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:59.140]   Maybe your parents said that to you when you were a kid, or maybe a trusted authority figure,
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.060]   teacher, or a pastor, or a mentor said those words over you, and here's what happened.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.060]   When they said those words to you, you began to internalize the reality that nothing you
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.220]   could do could ever be good enough, that no matter how many grades, how much effort, your
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:16.000]   parents never seem to be satisfied, never seem to be pleased with you, and you kind
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.100]   of found yourself thinking, "Well, I'm never going to be good enough at all."
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.380]   And because that's been internalized, years later, you're still living a life that when
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.060]   you're in relationships with the people around you, you're not expecting that relationship
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.060]   to go well.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.260]   You're not expecting them to accept you, love you, embrace you, because you are thinking,
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.260]   "I'm never going to be enough for my wife, for my husband, for my boss, for my colleague,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.300]   for my friends at church.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.580]   I'm never enough."
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:44.260]   And the word that was spoken has become flesh, and that flesh is now you.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.140]   Are you with me?
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:51.740]   Or maybe somebody said over you, "You're never going to amount to anything."
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.860]   And they immediately cast your future into doubt.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.300]   So then every time a job comes up, and you're like, "Man, should I apply for that?"
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.580]   You're thinking, "Hang on a sec.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.700]   I'm never going to amount to anything."
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.300]   And you're suddenly feeling imposter syndrome.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.980]   "Oh, this is not for me.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.300]   Somebody else is better at this than I am."
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.240]   And it's stopping you from actually taking the risk to step into the one thing that God
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:15.020]   has created you for, but you're staying away from it, because somebody at some point told
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.540]   you, "You're never going to amount to anything," and now you feel like an imposter all the
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.500]   time, no matter what it is that you try to do.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:24.780]   The word became flesh, and that flesh became you.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:29.460]   The reality is we do this to one another, don't we?
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.900]   We speak slander and gossip and harsh words.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.380]   We use our tongue in such destructive ways.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.140]   We've been hurt, and here's the reality.
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.500]   Hurt people hurt people.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.500]   And because we've been hurt, and because somebody said that to us, we've found ourselves saying
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.100]   that to somebody else.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:50.100]   And it seems that there's this cycle going on, and James writes to the church, and he
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:56.820]   says, "It's like the fire of Gehenna is coming out of our mouths."
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:06.740]   When we were created for communion and intimacy, we're just destroying everything.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.460]   Have a look at some of these other words that get spoken over us.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:17.500]   Some of these resonate with you and your journey.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.860]   Then James, in the moment of all of this, he says perhaps the strongest thing he says
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.860]   in this part.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:29.180]   Verse 9 and 12, he says, "With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and then with
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.020]   it we curse people who have been made in God's likeness.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.660]   Out of the same mouth comes praise and cursing.
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.940]   My brothers and sisters, this should not be.
[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.740]   Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.260]   My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives?
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.060]   A grapevine bear figs?
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.500]   Neither can salt spring produce fresh water."
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.940]   James says, "Look, we have to understand.
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.880]   We can see the power of the destructive words of the enemy, and we all have felt and experienced
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.340]   those words spoken over us."
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:58.080]   But James is like, "Here's the reality.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.660]   We all struggle with this.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.500]   We do both ourselves.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:07.460]   We come in, and we worship Him, and we praise Him, and we lift our hands up, and we say,
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.820]   'Yes, Lord, everything I am submitted to You.'"
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.140]   And then on Monday, we start to slander and gossip and speak down, and we start to criticize
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.140]   and judge.
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.420]   And then we come back on Sunday, and we praise Jesus again.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.340]   And James is saying, "Hang on a sec.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:29.500]   Can't you realize that that God process that leads to goodness and that satanic evil process
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:35.940]   that leads to death, don't you realize that both of these are coming out of your mouth?"
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.900]   And that's why he then challenges the church, and he says, "We all struggle with this, so
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.060]   the thing we have to do is check the source."
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.060]   Because he said, "Can fresh and salt come out of the same source?
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.060]   They cannot."
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.100]   So the issue here is not behavior modification.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.940]   How do I say nice to things?
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.840]   The issue here, what is going on in my heart?
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.700]   Because what's in here is obviously impacting what's coming out of here.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.580]   Because in Luke chapter 6, verse 45, he says, "Out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.580]   speaks."
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.820]   So when James is saying, "We have to get back to the source," he's basically saying, "Look
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.820]   at your heart."
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.820]   But remember, he's doing it pastorally.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.620]   He's like, "Look at your heart.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.860]   What is going inside of your heart that's causing stuff to be happening?"
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.820]   And it's almost like he's saying, "Look, we've got to invite the Holy Spirit to constantly
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.140]   be examining our heart."
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:34.220]   Because if it's true that our words can bring life or death in us or through us, then we
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.540]   have to constantly invite the Holy Spirit to be in our hearts.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.900]   Because the health of my heart will determine the grace of my words.
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.940]   You following?
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.140]   The health of my heart will determine the grace of my words.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:53.460]   So the question I should be asking myself is, "What's really going on in my heart?"
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.180]   I want to say two things predominantly go on in our hearts that cause our words to align
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.500]   more with the evil side than with God's side.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.580]   Sin and hurt.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.780]   Those two things are constantly grappling in our heart.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.460]   Sin is such a reality for us all.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:18.580]   Jesus was one that lived a certain life that shows us a different way.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.860]   1 Peter 2.22, Peter writes this beautiful thing.
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.860]   Let me read this to you.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.860]   1 Peter 2.22.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:28.940]   He says, speaking of Jesus, "He committed no sin, so no deceit was found in him."
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.940]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.620]   "No deceit was found in his mouth," Peter said, "because he committed no sin."
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.460]   So Peter makes this connection between the heart and the mouth.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.260]   He makes the connection with Jesus and says he's the only one.
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.260]   Remember James at the beginning of the passage, "If you were a perfect person and good things
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.740]   always came out of your mouth, but none of us are perfect."
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.660]   So James is like, "None of us are Jesus."
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.420]   So we all struggle with this.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.700]   But here's the reality, sin is one of the reasons why we struggle with this.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:00.780]   Because Jesus had no sin, therefore there was no deceit, no slander, no gossip, no malice,
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.940]   no brokenness coming out of his mouth.
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.660]   When we deal with sin in the source, we begin to find our language change.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.620]   But the reality is so many of us try to change the language and ignore the heart.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.140]   Come on church.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:19.180]   We try to change what we're saying, thinking that that's the thing that James is calling
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.180]   us to.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.500]   But Jesus is like, "I'm not asking you to change what you say.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.140]   I'm asking you to change your heart.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:30.060]   And when you change your heart, look at what you're about to say."
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.780]   Some of you here, you're spending a lot of time trying to get better at what you say
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:38.380]   without spending any time asking the question, "Why am I saying the things that I'm saying
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.700]   in the first place?"
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.700]   That's the heart.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.220]   Like, "What really is going on in my heart?"
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.580]   And so during worship, God's convicting me, "Andrew, your anchor's too short."
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.620]   "Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.580]   A lot of you have submitted to me, but there's still bits of you that are not submitted to
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.580]   me.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   You need to deal with that stuff."
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.620]   "The health of my heart will determine the grace of my words.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.620]   It'll be the same for you too.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.740]   I don't know about you, but I want to align to the right side."
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.660]   So that means I need to deal with the sin.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.180]   God's given us this grace of forgiveness and repentance.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.260]   He's given us the ability to let go of the things that darken our hearts.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:23.340]   And I want to encourage you, if you're finding yourself aligning more with that evil side,
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.700]   even though you know you don't want to, but you find yourself doing it, the way you speak
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.800]   to your spouse, the way you speak to your children, the way you speak to your colleagues,
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.940]   you know it's not right.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.940]   The question I think the Lord would ask you to is, just check your heart.
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.940]   What's going on?
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.980]   Is there some stuff there that may need to be brought to Him in repentance and His grace
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.340]   to forgive you?
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.580]   So that's sin.
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.380]   Let me finish on hurt.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.400]   Because I said earlier, hurting people hurt people.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.980]   And while sin is one of the things that causes the bad stuff that come out of our mouths,
[00:38:52.980 --> 00:39:00.760]   hurt perhaps even more causes us to not be the people that we were created to be.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.620]   Some of you here have been deeply hurt, deeply hurt by words spoken of you.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.400]   Some of it, it's generational.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.460]   Something was spoken over you as a child, and now that you're a parent, you're finding
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.880]   yourself speaking the same thing over your child.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.220]   And you know that that's not right, and you feel the shame of it, but the reality is you
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.220]   haven't been able to break that cycle.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.420]   Many of us here probably have struggled with the reality that we've been hurt by something
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:28.660]   somebody said, and it's become flesh, and that flesh is now us, and it's the way we
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.060]   think about ourselves now.
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:36.540]   And I want you to know that there are two things that will set you free from hurt when
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.660]   you think about it in terms of words.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.100]   And if you're feeling that here, these two things are the most important for you in this
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.100]   message.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.640]   Here's the first thing.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:51.820]   We need to rehear the word that God says to us so that we're not hearing the word that
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.820]   the enemy says.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:57.700]   Remember, the enemy comes to Adam and Eve and tries to get them to doubt God's word.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.020]   When we're walking in hurt and finding hurt coming out of our mouths, it's because we're
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.940]   doubting the way that we were truly created to be.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:10.180]   We need to realign the ears of our hearts to hear again what God says to us.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:15.320]   We need to allow Him to debar through the Scriptures, through our worship, through our
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.620]   community together.
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:23.020]   We need to hear the voice of God say the opposite thing from what the voice of the enemy said.
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:28.460]   So when somebody said to me before that I am not good enough, I hear from Jesus, "You
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:34.740]   are my son and my daughter whom I love, and with you I am well pleased."
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:39.340]   When the enemy has said, "You are never going to amount to anything," I'm hearing from the
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:44.940]   Lord, "I have put the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead in you, and I've put my
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.940]   passion and my mission in you, and I am setting you free."
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.020]   When somebody has told me, "You're ugly," I'm hearing from the Lord, "I have fearfully
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.660]   and wonderfully made you, and you are unique.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:01.860]   There is no one in all of creation that carries the image of God just like you."
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:06.700]   When the enemy has said that I am a person of shame, I hear from Jesus, "You are the
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.980]   righteousness of Christ."
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.420]   Come on church.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:19.980]   So we have to hear what the Lord is saying to us and believe His word over the words
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.660]   that have been spoken either by people with bad intention or even by people with good
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.660]   intention that still hurt us.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.900]   Are you with me?
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.780]   But there's a second piece.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.100]   I think this piece is actually even more important.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:36.580]   You see, I think it's not just about hearing what God says to us.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:41.140]   It's not just about hearing what's in His mouth directed towards us.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:46.620]   It's also now also about what is in our mouths about us.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:50.740]   You see, if the issue is this hurt that I'm carrying in my spirit, and if that hurt has
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:56.780]   made flesh in me, and I've begun to think of my identity based around that thing, then
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:01.220]   here's the thing, the way that I break that reality of that identity, yes, it's hearing
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.820]   what God says to me, but it's also now prophetically declaring with my own tongue that I am not
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.460]   what that word said that I was.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:15.420]   That I now also can take a stand like Adam standing before the animals and saying, "Lion
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.180]   and alligator and giraffe."
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.100]   I get to stand before myself and say, "I'm a son of God."
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.660]   Like I want to hear God say it, but I need to confess it with my tongue.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.300]   I need to speak out with my mouth because that's going to change something within me.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.900]   So I declare, "Lion."
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.540]   I declare, "Son of God."
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.500]   I declare, "Righteousness of Christ."
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.340]   I declare that the same spirit in me is the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, and
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.540]   I say it.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:50.460]   It's my confession, and I create worlds as I speak out with my tongue.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.420]   Not just the power of positive thinking.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.220]   I'm not saying, "Be a better person, Andrew."
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.580]   I'm declaring God's word through my word.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.380]   Are you with me?
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:04.780]   This is not some kind of hippie thing that we're talking about.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.380]   This is like I'm taking the promises of God that I'm hearing, but then I'm not just hearing
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:09.900]   them, I'm actually declaring them.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.140]   I'm not just receiving them, I'm speaking them.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.500]   I'm not just finding them in my life, I'm speaking them into my life, into the people
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   around me.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:22.620]   I'm a mouthpiece of the word, the debar of God.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:29.220]   And in that debarring myself, something profound in the healing of my heart takes place.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:31.620]   I break the bond.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.620]   Remember in Matthew 18, I love this, I know I'm going long, stay with me for a second.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.620]   This is okay?
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:38.980]   I'm very excited right now.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.500]   I'm sweating like a pig.
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.500]   You know in Matthew 18, when Jesus says, he says, "What you bind on earth will be bound
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   in heaven.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.260]   What you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.540]   What he's saying is, if you put your life in my hands, I will put my kingdom in your
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.300]   mouth.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.380]   So what you say will have an impact.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.780]   What you do will have an impact, like Ellison was talking about last week.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:06.820]   So we align ourselves to the God who speaks, creates, blesses, and is good.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.720]   And in doing that with our own tongue and mouth, we bind and we loose.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.580]   So what was bound in me by those people who spoke over me, I now loose through the word
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.700]   of God in my life.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.260]   This is why Isaiah, when he's standing there in Isaiah chapter 6, and God calls, "Hey,
[00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.260]   who am I going to send?"
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.500]   And Isaiah goes, "Me."
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.500]   What does God do?
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.060]   The first thing God does, takes a coal, and what does he do?
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.060]   Touches his mind?
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.060]   Nope.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.060]   Touches his heart?
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.060]   Nope.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:36.060]   Touches his mouth.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.540]   He's like, "You're going to go and be my mouthpiece."
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.180]   What does the New Testament say about you?
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.580]   You are a sent one.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.260]   So we go now with the need for the anointing of our mouths to be able to declare, not just
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:51.680]   hear the words of God, but to declare, to speak the words of God, to break the bonds
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.380]   that have happened in our hearts, and to truly come alive.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:00.380]   "We all struggle with this," says James, "but there is freedom."
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.380]   Amen?
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   Amen.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.380]   Would you stand with me?
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:07.820]   I would love to pray for you.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.620]   And here's how we're going to pray.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:17.860]   On the screen, I'm going to put up a whole bunch of things that are declarations that
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:24.580]   I've designed, and your issue may not be on there, but this is a catalyst maybe to think
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:28.740]   about what the declaration might be for the hurt or the need or the brokenness or the
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.100]   sin that is in you.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.900]   But you're in this room and anxiety has been a thing for you, and you've defined yourself
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.300]   that way, and you're often saying, "I'm an anxious person.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.340]   Your declaration might be, 'I'm not a slave to fear.'
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:48.140]   Or maybe your declaration is, 'I am good enough, and I've had people tell me other things,
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.140]   but here's what I declare.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.540]   I know God sees that in me, and here's my declaration.
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.620]   I am good enough.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.820]   His grace is sufficient.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.180]   I have been forgiven.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.180]   He will always be with me.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.820]   I have a sound mind.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.340]   Everybody around me tells me that I'm going crazy.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.220]   I've got a sound mind."
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:06.660]   So as we begin to declare the promises of God with our own tongue, we set ourselves
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.660]   free.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.540]   So here's what I want you to do.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.820]   I'm not going to have you do this crazy out loud, and that would be weird, but I just
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:16.180]   want you to take a moment to look on the screen and say, "You know what?
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.980]   I'm aligning to one of these."
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.660]   And again, maybe yours is not on the screen, but you know what it is.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:25.260]   And you're saying, "That's my declaration this week.
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.900]   That's the thing that needs to be on my tongue this week.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.740]   That's what I need to say in my spirit.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.580]   That's what I need to say to my family.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.580]   That's what I need to say to my wife or spouse.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:35.020]   It's what I need to say to my children.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.780]   I need to begin to speak words of life where I've been speaking death."
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:43.820]   And the starting point is to say, "I am not a slave to fear," or whatever it might be
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.820]   for you.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.380]   Father, I want to pray that you would release these people in this room to a greater sense
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.060]   of healing from sin.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:57.420]   For those in this room that need to deal with some sin in their lives because of the words
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.340]   that are coming out of their mouths, Lord, I want to pray for that conviction of your
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.420]   spirit in them in Jesus' name.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:09.220]   Lord, I pray for those of us who have been hurt deeply.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:12.780]   And because of that hurt, we recognize that some of the things that come out of our mouths
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:16.580]   are more aligned with the enemy's words than they are with the Lord's words.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:21.780]   Father, would you then speak to me really loudly about who you see me to be?
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:27.020]   And then would I in faith declare prophetically out of my own mouth the very person that you
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.780]   created in me?
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.100]   What is bound on earth is bound in heaven.
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.660]   What is loose on earth is loose in heaven.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:36.780]   I pray you would loose healing in the name of Jesus, Lord, over the people in this room.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.340]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.620]   Everyone say, "Amen."
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.900]   Hey, let's worship together.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.900]   Maybe you can do that.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.900]   You can take a moment.
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.700]   And in a moment, we're going to have a time for prayer.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.580]   And if you would like to receive prayer, we'll make space for you to do that before we close
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.260]   our service.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.260]   Amen.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.260]   Amen.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.260]   Amen.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:06.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
