[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   And Lord, I wanna pray for every heart in this room
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.920]   who has faithfully just prayed that prayer before you.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.200]   I wanna pray a release right now in the name of Jesus
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.960]   and a release through this message
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.400]   of anything that will hold them back.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.540]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.680]   Everyone says, hey, can we thank our worship team
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.240]   as always, thanks guys so much.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.920]   Have a seat.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.680]   So last week we had Vision Sunday here at the Vine.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.840]   So if this is your first Sunday with us
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.800]   or if you weren't able to be with us last week,
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.740]   we know that a lot of people travel and things like that.
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.860]   So you're welcome back.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.340]   We did Vision Sunday last week
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.960]   where we released really to you as a church
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.560]   the sense of what we are kind of feeling
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.200]   that God is saying about us as a church community
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.400]   here in Hong Kong in this time.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.520]   And really a word that we believe
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160]   is gonna sit over us as a church
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.080]   over the rest of this year
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.640]   and probably into the year to come in 2026.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.680]   And it's a word for us as a community together
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.000]   because if this is your home church,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.960]   you're not here just as yourself.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.920]   You're here a part of a community.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.200]   But it is also, as I said last week,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.920]   a word for you individually, for you personally
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.040]   in what is happening in your life.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.120]   And it is this word that we're in uncharted territory,
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.040]   that the Lord is wanting to move us into uncharted waters.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.540]   And I shared a picture last week
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.660]   that I had a few months ago
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.760]   about us as a church community like this,
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.920]   one of those early pioneer ships
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.600]   where they would be in safe harbor,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.540]   but then they would set out from safe harbor
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.480]   out into the ocean,
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.400]   and they would literally be sailing out
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.440]   to where there was no maps.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.400]   And they had this early kind of unreasonable hope
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.520]   that they believed that if they just sailed
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   beyond what they had currently mapped out,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.800]   that there might be lands beyond what they could realize
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.240]   or what they thought.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.800]   And this idea of the uncharted is exactly that,
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.640]   that there is no map,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.360]   there's no ability for us to know what's ahead
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.880]   because we've never been there before.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.000]   And the great encouragement
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.120]   that the Holy Spirit is saying to us as the Bind Church is,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.600]   I desire to take you to a place corporately
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.640]   and individually where you've never been before,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.580]   where you've never experienced me like that before,
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.880]   where you've never seen my kingdom and my spirit at work
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.360]   like it's going to work ever before.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.040]   And therefore, there is no strategy,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.600]   there's no current resource,
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.040]   there are no current gifts
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.840]   that are gonna be appropriate for what is to come,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.880]   but this is a completely different time, different season.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.040]   And what God is saying is,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.120]   are we ready to prepare ourselves
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.120]   for what that is that is to come?
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.320]   And it's interesting
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.000]   'cause he's pulling us out of our comfort zones.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.080]   He's put us in a place where we're going to be
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.120]   not with the things that normally would tether us
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.440]   and give us stability,
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.900]   we're gonna be a little bit out of what's comfortable for us.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.500]   But I want you to know that the greatest moments
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.880]   of growth in your life will always occur with Christ Jesus
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.960]   when you're out of your comfort zone,
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.240]   where you're in a place
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.500]   where you're gonna have to rely on him.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.760]   Last week, I shared a few things
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.620]   that I felt would shape this season.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's gonna be a season of discovery and adventure
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.820]   focused on the unknown but anticipated.
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.360]   This is really important, the unknown but anticipated.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.320]   It's unknown because this is an uncharted season.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.120]   So by its very definition, we don't know what's ahead.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.200]   But because it's unknown
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.160]   it doesn't mean that our posture at this time
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.400]   as a community should be passive.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.320]   It doesn't mean that, okay,
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.560]   we don't know what God's gonna do.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.120]   So we're just gonna sit back and kind of just wait for it.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.760]   In the picture I had last week of that sailing ship
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.640]   that's heading out into the unknown,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.400]   the captain's there at the bow at the front,
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.180]   leaning forward with his telescope,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.640]   looking for what's to come,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.000]   the intentionality within his spirit
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.940]   to look forward with hope for what is to come.
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.800]   So it's unknown, but we need to have a posture of heart,
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.600]   of focus within us, of anticipation for what's about to come.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.560]   The second thing we shared is that
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.160]   it's going to be a season of wholehearted reliance
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.520]   and trust in Jesus above everything else.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.200]   Because we don't currently have the map
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.840]   and the strategy to hold us where God's taking us.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.800]   And we shared last week that it is this purging season.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.520]   That perhaps as a church community
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.000]   and perhaps as you as an individual,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.160]   there have been some things
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.640]   that you've gotten comfortable with to rely on
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.600]   that you've been trusting and putting your hope
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.400]   and your faith and your reliance on that are not Jesus.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.240]   One of the primary reasons why God brings his church
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.140]   into a season of the uncharted is to shake off
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.120]   some of the things that we've begun to rely on
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.240]   that are not him.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.360]   And so as we go through this year,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.440]   we're gonna be challenging ourselves, challenging you.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   Have we gone over reliant on something?
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.240]   Are we trusting in our own strength?
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   Are we trusting in the things
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.000]   that we've trusted in the past?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And maybe they were great for us in the past,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.120]   but these are not the things
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.320]   that we should be trusting on now.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.160]   No, this is a season where Jesus gets the wholehearted
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.920]   reliance and trust in our lives.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.760]   The third thing we shared is that it's going to be a season
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.000]   where God's people, and this is really important,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.200]   a season of intentional readiness
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.600]   where God's people rely and prepare,
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.040]   not with a plan of action, but a purpose of their hearts.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.600]   In other words, because this is uncharted,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.520]   we don't have the map or the strategy
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.400]   that will help us to plan the action steps we need to take
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.320]   in order to benefit from the season.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.080]   No, instead, it's not about an action plan,
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.120]   it's about the posture of my heart.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.600]   It's about what's going on inside of me.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.120]   It's about the values that I hold to,
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.560]   because when God acts, I want to be one who responds.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.480]   And so you need to understand that in a season of uncharted,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.920]   the spotlight that the Holy Spirit is shining
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.280]   is on our character over our competencies.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.360]   I'm gonna say that again.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.480]   It's shining on our character over our competencies.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.000]   Not that we can't have gifts,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.360]   not that we can't be good at things,
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.760]   not that God hasn't blessed us
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.720]   with things that we're good at, of course,
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.080]   but in this season, the focus becomes more the character
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.000]   than the competencies, 'cause here's the thing,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.360]   we don't know what competencies
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.600]   we're gonna need for the future.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.080]   It's uncharted, no one's ever been there before.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.360]   We've not been there before, we've not experienced it.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.760]   We don't know what strategies or ministries
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.760]   or responses we're going to need when God acts,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.960]   so it's not about trying to come up with the competencies
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.120]   that are gonna hold us when God moves,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.600]   it's about the character we need today
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.560]   so that when God does move,
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.080]   when the treasure is discovered in the field,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.440]   when we see that pearl of great price,
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.400]   we give everything, we're ready to give it all,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.840]   we're ready to respond straight away.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.920]   It's a little bit like the people
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.960]   that work in the fire service,
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.760]   who are trained to respond without fear immediately
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.520]   when the fire takes place.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.680]   Could you imagine a church that was trained
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.560]   to respond without fear when the kingdom of God is at work?
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.800]   When God begins to do something in our workplace
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.200]   and we don't have the fear of going,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.880]   oh my gosh, I'm not gonna pray for this person
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.720]   in front of everybody,
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.440]   'cause if I did that, I'm gonna be judged,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.320]   but instead we're over our fear
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.280]   and we've got the character that says
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.720]   that when God's presence is here, I will respond
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.640]   and here's somebody who desperately needs prayer,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.400]   I'm gonna ask him if I can pray for them.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.840]   Or perhaps we're at that family dinner
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.400]   and we're sitting next to the uncle or the aunt
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.080]   that's twice removed, who we know is really abrasive
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.320]   against the Christian faith,
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.640]   and they're beginning to ask us
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.000]   how things are going in our lives
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.200]   and what's happening in their lives,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.920]   and we're thinking, well, I better not share anything
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.640]   about church 'cause it's gonna upset them,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.120]   and we sense that the Holy Spirit is saying
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.480]   this might be a moment where you can begin to testify
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.800]   about what God's doing in your life
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.520]   and you've been trained and equipped
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.880]   to respond to the kingdom without fear.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.640]   Can you imagine a church like that?
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.800]   This is not the first time in history
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.920]   that God has called his church
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.480]   to focus on their character over their competencies
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.320]   'cause he's moving them into the uncharted.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.960]   In fact, perhaps the most important moment
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.120]   that this has happened in church history
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.760]   is the early church in the first century,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.560]   those first disciples as they're wrestling
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.160]   with the profundity that Jesus has risen from the dead.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.200]   I mean, imagine the experience they went through
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.600]   believing that Jesus was the Messiah
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.200]   and then seeing him killed on a cross
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.000]   and then walking away from that going like,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.120]   well, maybe we got that wrong, I guess he was just a prophet
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.800]   but then Jesus raised from the dead,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.040]   shows himself to them, and suddenly they realize
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.840]   he is the Messiah, he is the one
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.200]   that we've been longing for, he has come,
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.480]   and then Jesus says to them,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.040]   hey, here's the great commission,
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.760]   go into the Greco-Roman Empire,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.440]   sharing the faith of the gospel,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.000]   teaching people to obey my commands
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.720]   and I'll be with you forever,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.400]   and then stay here in Jerusalem
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.800]   and I'm gonna send the Holy Spirit to empower you to go.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.120]   And then suddenly the disciples are thrust
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.920]   into uncharted territory, uncharted waters.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   They had no idea that Jesus was gonna expect them to do
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.680]   what he expects them to do.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   And he doesn't give them a roadmap or a strategy or a plan,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.360]   he sends them out in the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.520]   to experience the kingdom, to find the treasure,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.920]   to see the pearls.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.240]   The beautiful thing about the gospel of Acts
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.720]   is that it's this wonderful idea of what happens
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.040]   when God shows up when you're least expecting it.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.200]   Throughout the whole book, you have these moments
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.760]   where the writer, Luke, is writing these things
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.920]   and he uses this Greek word for suddenly.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.240]   He uses it a lot because he's trying to express
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.960]   the suddenness of God's kingdom.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.680]   He's like, suddenly the person is there
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.280]   and the disciples try to pray for him.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.160]   Suddenly the chains break off
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.560]   and they're free from prison.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.920]   Suddenly this happens, suddenly that happens.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.080]   And it's amazing because you see time and time again,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.120]   the disciples just going about their normal average day,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.040]   not expecting anything, and suddenly
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.360]   the kingdom of God appears.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.520]   And here's the question, will the disciples respond
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.160]   when they see a suddenly of God?
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.120]   And one of the things that you almost see all the time
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   in the book of Acts is that when there's a suddenly of God,
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.520]   there's an immediate response from the church.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   There's an immediate respond in faith
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.800]   to what the kingdom and what the spirit
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.920]   is doing in that moment.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.400]   And this teaches us something so important
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.920]   about uncharted seasons.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.760]   Look, we cannot predict the suddenlies,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.960]   but we can prepare for the immediatelys.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.440]   Come on, church.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.200]   We can't predict the suddenlies.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.320]   This is uncharted season.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.880]   So by its very definition, we can't predict
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.600]   when or how or what God is gonna do.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.160]   God's not asking you to predict the suddenlies.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.440]   That's his domain, not yours.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   You can't do that.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.040]   What you can do though is prepare yourself
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.000]   for the immediatelys, that when God does show up,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.480]   when you discover the treasure, when you see the pearl,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.440]   you respond because you put character over competency.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.080]   You put your values over anything else.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.360]   And your value is to say, God, when you act,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.640]   I wanna be one of the workers in the work field.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.640]   I wanna be one of the ones that's reaching out
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.920]   with the gospel of hope.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.600]   Lord, would you choose me?
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.760]   If you act, I'm gonna respond.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.600]   Are you with me?
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.840]   So what we're gonna do with you over the next six weeks,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.800]   we're actually gonna walk through the story of Acts.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.080]   We're not gonna look at it as like a book study.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.920]   We're gonna pull out actually a study
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.400]   on the character of the disciples, the early church.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.040]   And we're gonna look at what are some of the key values
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.080]   that they hold in them that enables them
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.520]   to be positioned for the immediatelys
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.480]   when God does it suddenly.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   And we're gonna teach you six of these things.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.720]   And the reason why we're focusing on this
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.680]   is 'cause these are the things that we feel
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.040]   like the Holy Spirit is wanting to teach in us.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.640]   Let me show you what the six values are gonna be.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.080]   Stepping out, the obedience to respond
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.200]   to the way that the Holy Spirit is,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.360]   even when it's uncomfortable to do so.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.280]   The openness to changing our thinking and our traditions
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.560]   when God challenges them.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.880]   The willingness to be persecuted for our faith.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.360]   Come on, church.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.680]   Yeah, this is gonna be a great series.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.080]   Do come back next week, by the way.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.120]   It's gonna be.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.200]   The sacrifice of trusting in Jesus
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.520]   even when it might cost us dearly.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.600]   The ability to commit to hardship
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.280]   when we know it has redemptive purpose.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.400]   The call to sharing our faith radically,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.520]   honestly, and hopefully.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.040]   My friends, these are the core character values
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.080]   that the early church held inside of them,
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.560]   which enabled them to do the things
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.240]   that God wanted to do through them.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.400]   Not that they had a monopoly on what God was going to do,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.360]   but when God acted, these things enabled them
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.240]   out of obedience, out of trust,
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.840]   out of the willingness to be persecuted,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.680]   out of the openness to walking through hard times
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.360]   and hardships, they positioned themselves
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.520]   time and time again for the glory of God
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.840]   in the place that he had placed them.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.080]   Could you imagine a church in Hong Kong
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.800]   that was willing to be persecuted for its faith?
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.560]   Could you imagine a church that's willing
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.640]   to go through hardship knowing it has redemptive purpose?
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.480]   Could you imagine a church full of courageous
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.040]   and bold people sharing their faith
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.000]   'cause they've been liberated from the fear of man?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.400]   And I think this is not just something
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.000]   that God wants the Hong Kong church to hold.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I think it's something the global church needs at this time.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.720]   And so we're gonna go through this series together
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.800]   step by step and we're gonna bring
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.240]   some pretty challenging messages to you
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.720]   over the next six weeks and my prayer
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.680]   is that God would do something within us,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.440]   preparing us for the immediately of his suddenness.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.120]   We're gonna start today by just looking
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.160]   at the first of these and it's really
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.800]   just the first few verses of the book of Acts itself
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.560]   'cause in these verses you see Jesus do something.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.360]   Before any of the suddenness occur,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.680]   Jesus prepares his disciples for their next step,
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.240]   for the way in which he can liberate them,
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.200]   release some things from them
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.840]   so that they could be best prepared
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.120]   for the suddenness to come.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.600]   Let me read this to you from Acts chapter one
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.200]   starting in verse one.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.160]   In my former book, Theophilus,
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.960]   I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.080]   until the day that he was taken up to heaven.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.160]   After giving instructions through the Holy Spirit
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.120]   to the apostles that he had chosen.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.760]   After his suffering, he showed himself
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.760]   to these men and women and gave many convincing proofs
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.880]   that he was alive.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.040]   He appeared to them over a period of 40 days
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.440]   and spoke about the kingdom of God.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.320]   On one occasion while he was eating with them,
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.520]   he gave them this command,
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.200]   "Do not leave Jerusalem,
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.840]   "but wait for the gift my father promised,
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.480]   "which you have heard me speak about.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.480]   "For John baptized with water,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.520]   "but in a few days time you will be baptized
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.840]   "with the Holy Spirit."
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.880]   I love what Luke's doing here.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.600]   He's writing this book to his Gentile benefactor,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.080]   probably a wealthy Gentile called Theophilus
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.120]   who was interested in the Christian faith.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.760]   He's writing a story about what happens
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.160]   in the early church to this person.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.840]   He starts by capturing this moment
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.720]   where Jesus is in his resurrection
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.360]   and he's beginning to shape and mold the disciples
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.640]   for all that's next.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.320]   I wonder if you've ever put yourself
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.960]   in the shoes of the disciples at the start of the book of Acts
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.880]   'cause here's these disciples
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.960]   and they've just encountered Jesus' death and resurrection.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.360]   They've had to wrestle deeply with the reality of that,
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.800]   but now he's risen, they've seen him,
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.360]   he's appeared to them over 600 times, over a lot of times,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.880]   and he's beginning to teach them about the new things.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.400]   So there's the great commission
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.360]   and then he says, "Stay in Jerusalem
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.240]   "'cause I'm gonna send you the Spirit
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.480]   "which is gonna be the thing that will power you
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.400]   "for what's ahead."
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.680]   So he's speaking about this,
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.200]   but the disciples are now wrestling with the reality
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.080]   that Jesus actually is the Messiah.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.120]   And I want you to follow this
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.400]   'cause this is really important for the beginning of Acts.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.080]   The disciples know that now Jesus is absolutely the Messiah.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   So in their mind, they're thinking that Jesus
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.360]   is gonna do some very specific things next
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.120]   because they're thinking that they're in a situation
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.880]   where Jesus is now gonna act
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.960]   how they had always anticipated he was going to act.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.240]   And so they're posturing themselves for that,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.800]   but then Jesus says, "Hey, I'm leaving."
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.080]   And you can imagine the disciples going,
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.360]   "But you've only just come back.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.680]   "You've only just returned.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.280]   "What do you mean you're gonna leave again?"
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.440]   And they're kind of thinking, "No, no, no, that can't work.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.480]   "That can't be."
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.400]   It's funny, right?
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.560]   The disciples have always struggled with the reality
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.880]   of trying to tell Jesus what to do.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.280]   Have you noticed that?
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.040]   It's almost like the disciples look at Jesus and go,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.120]   "God loves you, but we have a plan for you."
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.040]   Because remember right back before
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.480]   when Jesus was saying, "I'm gonna have to die on the cross,"
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.920]   there's Peter going, "No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.600]   "That's not part of our plan.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.520]   "No, no, you don't need to die.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.440]   "It's cool, dude.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.760]   "You'll be fine."
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.200]   And he's like, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.440]   Remember that moment.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.920]   Well, here's another moment like that
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.360]   'cause Jesus is saying, "Hey, I'm gonna go,
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.280]   "but I need to go 'cause I'm gonna send
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.120]   "the Holy Spirit to you."
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.600]   And they're saying, "We don't wanna downgrade Jesus.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.080]   "We want you here.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.280]   "You've resurrected.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.320]   "You're the Messiah.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320]   "We want you here.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.680]   "And not only do we want you here,
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   "but there's still work for you to do, Jesus.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.840]   "We've still got some ideas for the things
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.040]   "that you should be doing in your resurrection."
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.040]   In fact, it actually says here, notice this,
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.680]   follow on in verse six.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.000]   It says, "So when they met together,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.760]   "they actually asked him this,
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   "Lord, are you at this time going to restore
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.960]   "the kingdom of Israel?"
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.280]   In other words, the disciples are like,
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.680]   "We have an idea, Lord,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.800]   "of what you're supposed to now be doing.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.440]   "And we know this because our rabbis
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.880]   "have been teaching this in the synagogue
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.120]   "and our prophets of old, prophets like Jeremiah
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.600]   "and Isaiah and Amos and Daniel,
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.520]   "they've been saying that a day will come
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.480]   "when the Messiah will be here
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.760]   "and it will be like a day of Yahweh.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.360]   "The Son of Man will come down and be with us
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.240]   "and sin will be eradicated
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.160]   "and Israel will be restored."
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.520]   That's the word they use here.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.960]   Are you gonna restore?
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.600]   Are you gonna bring everything back
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.240]   into the hands of Israel?
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   They're expecting Jesus now to do that.
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.480]   And this is their idea of what they want Jesus.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.680]   This is like, they're like literally coming up to Jesus
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.400]   and going, "Yeah, that's nice about the Spirit,
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.760]   "but Jesus, you're forgetting something.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.560]   "We've got a plan here.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.040]   "And we've been talking about this plan for a long time.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.520]   "And this plan, I just want you to show,
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.400]   "we've actually done a really nice cute map
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.320]   "of this plan, Jesus.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.360]   "Let me just show you this."
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.120]   Right, the very first thing you're now gonna do
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.360]   is get rid of the Romans.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.440]   Yeah, you know, the nasty Romans,
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.760]   you're gonna get rid of them.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.320]   After that, you're then supposed to get rid of sin.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.480]   If you wanna get rid of sin first before the Romans,
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.760]   that's fine, but we'd rather you punish the Romans first.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.080]   So that's why the Romans are there first.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.920]   Do you see this, Jesus?
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.200]   Don't worry, we've summarized it all
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.600]   in a bullet point form here, easy for you to follow.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.040]   Here it is, Jesus.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.840]   Now we laugh, but here's what I wanna say to us.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.720]   I think this is the first thing
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.400]   that Jesus wants to release from us as his church.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.920]   I think so many of us, myself included,
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.320]   that's really how I am in relationship with Jesus in prayer.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.880]   Come on, church.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.760]   Like, Jesus, I love you, but I have a plan for you.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.520]   And my plan for you is this,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.000]   because I have some important things
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   that I'm trying to do in life,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.840]   and I'm trying to achieve some things,
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.440]   and I've got some ideas, Lord.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.760]   And in fact, if you have a moment, Jesus,
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.240]   I'd like to just take you into my map
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.480]   and just show you a little bit of what I had in plan.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.760]   Right here is when you're supposed to give me my spouse.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.360]   Okay, you haven't done that one yet,
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.080]   but I'm just highlighting it for you in case you forgot.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:18.920]   But that's cool.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.960]   After that, you can see that promotion I've been praying for.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.400]   I know that's coming, right?
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.960]   And I know you wanna do that, and are you with me?
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.600]   Like, isn't it interesting that we as Christians,
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.160]   we have this plan, we have this idea,
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.440]   we have a map for what we want Jesus to do,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.080]   and it's like we're in this moment
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.200]   where we want him in our prayer lives
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.840]   to basically enact what we're doing.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.040]   Let me just say, not the whole of your plan
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.880]   that you have is bad, but it's your plan.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.360]   It's not his.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.160]   And maybe elements of it he will do,
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.560]   and elements of it are great,
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.800]   and elements of it he might wanna respond to,
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.400]   but it's not about you having a plan
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.120]   of what Jesus is gonna do in your life.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.480]   It's about recognizing you're in an uncharted season,
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.080]   which means the plan has been stripped from you,
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.720]   which means he's placing you specifically in a moment
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.280]   where all the things that are on the list
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.960]   that you're constantly asking him to respond to,
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.480]   again, are not necessarily bad things,
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.080]   but he's wanting to shift your thinking
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.960]   and shift your spiritual life away from Jesus.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.600]   Here's the things I need you now to do for me,
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.040]   to Jesus, what is it that you desire to do?
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.320]   What is on your heart, not just for me,
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.120]   but for the vine and for Hong Kong and for the city?
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.360]   Like, we're in times where I don't know what's next,
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.000]   so Lord, I'm relying and I'm trusting on you,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.280]   I'm letting go of what I would like,
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.640]   and I'm putting myself in an uncomfortable position
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.120]   to ask what you would like.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.840]   And I'm willing to release anything from me
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.600]   that you do not like,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.360]   even the plans that I have to prosper you, Jesus.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.560]   That scripture, by the way, is,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.440]   I have plans to prosper you, says the Lord.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.680]   But we Christians so often live in our prayer lives
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.320]   as we've got plans to prosper you, Jesus.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.800]   Are you with me?
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.680]   And so we need to purge ourselves from that.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.320]   Notice how Jesus responds, I think this is so beautiful.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.920]   He says in verse seven, he said to them,
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.720]   "It is not for you to know the times or dates
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.320]   "the Father has set by his own authority."
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.560]   He doesn't say it's not gonna happen,
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.800]   he just wants to shift them away from something
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.880]   that is so critical here.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:35.360]   He's saying, "It is not for you in a season of uncharted
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.320]   "to have the answers to the timing of everything."
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.520]   It's not for you to know the when of God, he's saying.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.200]   In fact, he's basically saying to the disciples,
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.920]   I wanna liberate you, I wanna free you,
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.520]   I wanna release you from the prison
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.880]   that is created by your desire
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.800]   to know when I'm going to do everything.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.160]   It is not for you to have the understanding of the when.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.560]   The when of God is such a thing that we as Christians,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.400]   I think, so hold onto.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.720]   I know that so much in our prayer life,
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.200]   in our pastoral work, it's like,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.560]   when is God gonna come through?
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.200]   And here's the thing, when Christians have an idea
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.880]   of what they think the timeframe should be for God
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.360]   and God doesn't act in their timeframe,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.720]   they get angry at God.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.280]   I know I've done this many times in my own life.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.640]   You've heard me tell many stories over the years of time.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.040]   So I've put God in a time box
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   and God doesn't do it in that time box
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.440]   and I get frustrated and angry at God
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.240]   because he hasn't done what I've wanted him to do
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.600]   when I was hoping he could do it.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.120]   The disciples come to him and go, is now the time?
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.280]   And Jesus goes, the first thing I need to do
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.080]   as you move into uncharted territory
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.840]   is to release you from the worry of time.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.320]   Some of you in this room,
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.240]   you are so tied up in the frustration
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.400]   of the perceived delay in the delivery
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.240]   of God's activity in your life
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.880]   or the obsession you have for the need
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.600]   of the foreknowledge of it
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.400]   that you are totally unprepared to react and respond to it
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.400]   when it actually arrives.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.000]   Oh, church, man, I need you to read that
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.560]   and pause on that for a second.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:20.520]   Some of us are so wound up by knowing the when,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.800]   by holding on to the timeframe that we have
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.440]   and the first thing God wants to do is liberate you
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.200]   from the desire that you have to know it all.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.960]   This was the desire that Adam and Eve had
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.360]   when they took the fruit in Genesis 3.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.040]   What Satan said to them through the form of the snake was,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.200]   if you take this, you will be like God.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.120]   You will know it all.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.400]   It's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.240]   And here's the disciples again saying,
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.520]   we need to know what it is you're going to do.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.240]   And Jesus says, it's not for you to know the time.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.600]   I wanna liberate you from the concerns
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.800]   that you have for time.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.640]   'Cause here's the thing,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.440]   the reason why we are so concerned with time
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.320]   is 'cause we want to control.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.360]   We wanna find some stability,
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.160]   particularly when we're out of our comfort zones.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.480]   We wanna find something that we can ridge ourselves into.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.960]   And if we could just know the timing that God has
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.240]   for certain things that can happen in our lives,
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   that would, we think, free us to relax.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.080]   And what God is saying is that your obsession with time,
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.560]   when that is not in your hands
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.000]   and not something you can control,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.840]   that's you trying to be God.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.600]   You're not God, you're human.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   I'm gonna release your desire
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.160]   for the knowledge of the time of everything,
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.680]   and you will find yourself at greater peace.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.320]   See, the path for peace in times that are uncharted
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.280]   is not the knowledge of the timing of everything,
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   but the release of the need for control and certainty
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.200]   in all that's going to happen.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.040]   And we cannot start this time,
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.640]   we cannot start as a church in this season of uncharted
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.600]   until we've recognized that we need to release control,
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.560]   release the control and the certainty
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.560]   that God is going to act and respond,
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.040]   and instead, posture our hearts
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.880]   in the place of character and values
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.480]   to be able to respond when he acts.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.800]   Are you with me?
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.040]   Some of you here, this is a really,
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.160]   I just wanna, I'm gonna pause on this one more time.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.040]   Some of you here, this is a really significantly
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.960]   fundamental thing that you need to release today.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.720]   And it's scary.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.080]   It'll put you in your, out of your comfort zone.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.480]   It will put you in a place where you'll feel
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.160]   like you're losing control,
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.080]   but sometimes the need for us to feel
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.560]   like we're losing control or that we're out
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.840]   of that place of comfort is the starting point
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.480]   of everything that Jesus now wants to do in us.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.600]   Notice how this is actually here in the scripture.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.000]   Is this helping some people?
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.040]   Okay.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.640]   It says here in verse seven,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.840]   "It is not for you to know the times
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.640]   "and the dates that the Father has set," verse eight,
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.560]   "but you will receive power
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.280]   "when the Holy Spirit comes on you,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.400]   "and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.840]   "and Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth."
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.160]   I love this, he doesn't say,
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.840]   "Hey, I'm going to give you the answers."
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.960]   He doesn't say, "I'm gonna sort out all your problems."
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.240]   He doesn't say, "I'm gonna like answer your timeframe,
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.080]   "how you have it."
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.760]   We've come to him with our maps.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.000]   He's gently rolled them back up again.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.960]   But here's what he's saying.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.520]   I'm not leaving you alone.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.360]   He said, "You're gonna receive power
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   "when my Holy Spirit comes upon you."
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   So I'm not leaving you to just be here on your own.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.600]   Equally, I'm not giving you a detailed map
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.360]   that's gonna give you all the answers straight away.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.240]   What I will do though is put my power inside of you.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.600]   I will pour out my Holy Spirit on you,
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.440]   and that power will be what will mark you,
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.880]   will be what defines you.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.600]   You're not getting answers, you're gonna get my power.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.840]   You're not gonna get the timing of everything,
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.360]   you're gonna get my Spirit in your life.
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.160]   And when you have my power, then you can become.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.920]   This is so important.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.320]   So often, I think as a church,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.840]   when we think about the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.120]   we think it's for us.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.480]   We think it's for what happens here on a Sunday.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.640]   We come in here longing for the worship
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.040]   and longing for the movement of the Holy Spirit amongst us,
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.600]   and we love that, and of course we should.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.080]   It's something to be celebrated.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.240]   It is something to be expected and looked for.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.680]   But the power that Jesus is talking here about
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.840]   is not a feeling in a worship service.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.640]   What he's talking about here to the disciples
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.360]   is you're gonna receive power,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.680]   and then notice what he says.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.760]   He specifically says, "And then you will become."
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.000]   In the Greek, it says, "You will become."
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.840]   In our translation, it says, "You will be."
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.080]   It's future tense.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.120]   What he's saying is, notice the journey,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:50.960]   what Jesus is doing.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.600]   He's saying, "Your plan, not gonna work.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.200]   "Your obsession with timing is only gonna cause you stress.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.920]   "I need you to release all of that
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.200]   "so that you're a vessel ready to receive
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.880]   "the power of my Spirit."
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.960]   But that power of the Spirit is not just there
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.040]   to make you feel good or to give you some gifts
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.160]   or to give you some fruit, as much as that is good.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.240]   Here's what the power of that Spirit will do.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.280]   It will make you to become.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.160]   It will transform you.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.440]   It will form you, shape you into the person
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.240]   that I need you to be in the time of Uncharted.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.920]   The reason why the Holy Spirit is poured out
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.800]   in seasons of Uncharted is because the Spirit
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.480]   longs to change us, longs to transform us and renew us.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.640]   The focus is on character over competency.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.160]   So the Spirit comes to reform and to change.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   And so a season of Uncharted is a spiritual formation season.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.960]   By its very nature, times of Uncharted are Spirit-empowered.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.800]   And because they're Spirit-empowered,
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.720]   they're designed to change something within us,
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.840]   to release sin from us, to strengthen us,
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.480]   to give us the character and the values that we will need
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.720]   so we can respond immediately to the suddenlies
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.560]   that are around us.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.640]   And our vision here at the Vine is growing big people.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.520]   It's a maturity vision.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.680]   It's a spiritual formation vision.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.720]   And this is why God's bringing us into the Uncharted.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.840]   It's not to freak you out.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.720]   It's not to make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.680]   It's actually to change you.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.840]   You gotta understand that the greatest times
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.360]   of spiritual growth and change will happen in your life
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.720]   when you have to rely 100% on Jesus and nothing else.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.800]   The greatest times of spiritual growth and change
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.480]   in your life will happen when you let go
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.320]   of your need to know everything.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.640]   The greatest spiritual change that will happen
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.720]   is when you actually say, "I am open
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.960]   "to whatever is your heart, your agenda,
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.560]   "your plans, your strategy,
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.040]   "whatever it is that you wanna do, I have no idea.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.520]   "But whatever it is that you wanna do,
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.120]   "I want to receive it in the name of Jesus.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.000]   "Make me into one."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.080]   Oh, let me preach on this rule.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.640]   This is not my note, so I need to preach on this rule.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.080]   I'm gonna do this real quick, sorry.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.400]   The prodigal son is one of my favorite stories,
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.160]   and it's because the prodigal son goes in this journey.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.600]   At the start, he goes to his father,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.680]   and he says, "Give me my inheritance."
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.120]   And then he goes, and he squanders it,
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.080]   and he's in a place of incredible uncomfort
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.520]   'cause of his sin and his brokenness.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.480]   And he decides in that place that it's better
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.840]   to be a servant in his father's household
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.040]   than to be in the muck and the mire
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.000]   that he found himself in.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.360]   And as he goes to his father, his father runs towards him,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.280]   and the first words out of the mouth of the prodigal son
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.720]   is this, "Lord, make me.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.880]   "Make me like one of your servants."
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.080]   There's something that happens in the life of the prodigal
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.800]   where he goes from God, "Give me," to God, "Make me."
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.720]   And that's the journey of the uncharted.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.480]   That's the spiritual formation journey
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.000]   that we're in right now.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.520]   And I wanna encourage you, challenge you
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.240]   to be open to whatever the Holy Spirit wants to do
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.200]   'cause there is a make me that I need,
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.900]   and I'm sure there is for you too.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.200]   What is it that he is making us into?
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.480]   He then says this, "That you would become my witnesses
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.720]   "in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.880]   "and to the ends of the earth."
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.200]   He says, "You will become my witnesses."
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.960]   Notice this, the word witness there in the Greek
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.960]   is the word martyris, which is where we get martyrdom from.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.600]   It's the idea of living such a way that people can see.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.960]   It was actually a legal term, and it was literally designed
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.960]   in the legal concepts of those days
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.240]   to be somebody can prove the verification of facts
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.920]   by how they've experienced and lived their lives.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.920]   A witness is someone who demonstrates and declares
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.440]   what it is that has happened for them.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.800]   So this emphasis of demonstrating and declaring,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.880]   not just saying, but living.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.840]   Remember a few weeks ago, we spoke about the idea
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.480]   of a new song that is on our mouths
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.600]   so that we can live it out so people can see it.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.480]   That's a witness.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.880]   So when Jesus says, "My spirit is gonna fall on you
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.960]   "and empower you to become a witness,"
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.320]   what he's saying is, "This is all about you
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.760]   "in public space.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.360]   "This is all about me doing something in you
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.280]   "so that you would be something of me out there."
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.340]   He doesn't come to the church, to the disciples
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.840]   at the beginning of their formation of the church
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.960]   and say, "I'm gonna pour out my spirit of power upon you
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.080]   "so that you would be my privately blessed individuals."
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.240]   Come on, church.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.480]   He doesn't say, "So that you will be my privately blessed
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.200]   "individuals and you'll have a great time
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.800]   "for 90 minutes on a Sunday, woo-hoo."
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.360]   He says, "No, I'm pouring out my spirit on you
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.340]   "because I'm moving you into uncharted seasons.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.260]   "Take away your strategy, take away your obsession
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.460]   "about the timing of everything.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.460]   "Receive my power because I wanna shape and form in you
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.920]   "something so much that you would then be
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.160]   "a public testimony, a public witness to my power,
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.080]   "my spirit, my life in the world."
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.760]   You're gonna be a witness, he says, in Jerusalem, Judea,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.640]   Samaria, to the ends of the world.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.680]   It's gonna be about what I do within you
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.100]   so that the church would be public,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.540]   not private, huddled together as much as we love doing this,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.880]   but we do this on behalf of everything
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.080]   that's gonna happen in your week ahead.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.200]   This is uncharted, that we would be so filled
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.660]   with the spirit, that we're so changed within us
[00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.040]   that we become the living witnesses of God in the world.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.120]   This is why the first value that Jesus is instilling
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.760]   into the disciples right at the start
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.600]   is this obedience to the work of the spirit,
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.480]   even if that means it's gonna be uncomfortable for you.
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.840]   Are you gonna be obedient to what the spirit is doing,
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.000]   even though that might put you
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.600]   in some challenging situations?
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.280]   Maybe that'll put you in a place where it's uncomfortable,
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.680]   but are you willing to live your life so much
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.800]   that you would become a witness of him,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.840]   one who demonstrates and declares the glory of God
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.120]   in the world around him?
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.880]   And this, my friends, becomes all of the book of Acts
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.160]   from this point.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.480]   This is why all of this is so important
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.040]   and why Jesus is teaching this right at the start
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.520]   into his church 'cause he's shaking off some of the dust
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.560]   that was gonna settle on them.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.040]   He's preparing them for what's ahead.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.840]   And in the future, in the weeks ahead,
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.440]   and we're gonna see this in the series a lot,
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.960]   his people become responders, witnesses to the power
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.000]   and the glory of God simply because they said
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.840]   they were open.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.400]   In fact, let me show you one example of this very quickly
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.160]   here this morning as we draw to a close.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.120]   I love this example.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.200]   This is found in Acts chapter eight.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.440]   Follow this.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.640]   "Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip,"
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.040]   Philip, one of the disciples,
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.640]   "Go south to the road, the desert road,
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.960]   "that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.480]   "So he started out," notice this.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.600]   Philip had no idea what God was gonna do that day.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.680]   He didn't go, "Okay, God, thank you for speaking to me
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.720]   "this morning in my quiet time.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.680]   "I really appreciate that.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.520]   "Great to have your voice in my life.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.480]   "You want me to go down a road.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.720]   "First of all, I need to know exactly
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.320]   "how to walk down that road.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   "It would be really good if you could tell me
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.760]   "what's ahead down that road.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.360]   "I'd like to get prepared for all of that."
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.280]   This would be like God saying to me one morning,
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.000]   "Andrew, I want you to walk down one chai road.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.440]   "I want you to walk from the Causeway Bay Inn
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.200]   "towards Central, and I just want you to walk."
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.440]   And me going, "I'm gonna walk."
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.720]   And you guys going, "What is Andrew doing?"
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.800]   Philip just has no idea.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.400]   But notice, he's obedient to the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.680]   even though it might be uncomfortable,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.240]   even though he doesn't have all the answers,
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.320]   even though he doesn't know how things are gonna work out,
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.480]   but he's willing to go.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.000]   Notice what happens next.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.720]   So then he stepped out, and on his way,
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:38.600]   he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.920]   in charge of all the treasury of Candace,
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.560]   queen of the Ethiopians.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.120]   This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.400]   and on his way home was sitting in his chariot
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.120]   reading the book of the Isaiah the prophet.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.800]   The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.440]   "and stay near it."
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.960]   Isn't this great?
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.840]   So here's Philip, no idea what's about to happen,
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.280]   no idea, but he's being faithful
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.280]   to what the Spirit's told him to do.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.160]   He's walking randomly down this road,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.240]   but in the side, the story is God is brewing up something
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.840]   that only God can brew up.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.880]   And here's this Ethiopian eunuch,
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.720]   this man of standing in the upper Nile region of Africa,
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.800]   one that God has been working on his heart already,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.360]   one who's actually gone to Jerusalem
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.640]   to learn what it might be to worship this Yahweh,
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.800]   to worship this God, and to wonder
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.440]   what the Messiah might be all about.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.680]   So God's at work with the Ethiopian,
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.360]   and he's at work with Philip,
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.960]   who's willing to live in a certain way.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.200]   And it's almost like God is bringing
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.160]   these two things together, and you can see God's excitement
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.800]   as they come closer and closer together.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.960]   You following this?
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.320]   So here's Philip, now notice this.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.000]   Then the Holy Spirit says, "Go and stand
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.360]   "alongside of that chariot."
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.880]   Now the chariot was walking at the time,
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.320]   so he's having to run alongside this chariot.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.320]   I mean, he's looking like an idiot at this moment.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.480]   But he's willing to be uncomfortable
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.960]   in obedience to the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.800]   He's running alongside the chariot.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.200]   He has no idea why he's running alongside the chariot.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.800]   But as he's running alongside of it,
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.360]   he hears the person inside reading from the scroll,
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.880]   the book of Isaiah.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.680]   Now here's the fascinating thing.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.240]   At this point, notice what happens,
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.960]   because what we think is gonna happen doesn't.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.720]   It says here, "Then Philip ran up to the chariot
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.800]   "and heard the man reading from Isaiah the prophet.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.440]   "'Do you understand what you are reading?'
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.480]   "Philip asked.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.360]   "'How can I?' he said.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.120]   "'Unless someone explains it to me.'
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   "So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him."
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.240]   I love this moment because the Holy Spirit had said,
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.840]   "Go down this road," he had gone.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.800]   The Holy Spirit said, "Go alongside this chariot."
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.320]   He had gone alongside this chariot.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.360]   Now the Holy Spirit said, "Talk to the guy."
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.600]   No, the Holy Spirit didn't say that.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.960]   The Holy Spirit led him to the very place
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.520]   where then Philip, because he's got a character
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.520]   over competency, 'cause he knows he's uncharted waters,
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.880]   because the Holy Spirit has been forming and shaping him
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.440]   when he gets alongside the chariot,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.240]   the Holy Spirit doesn't have to tell him
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.800]   to begin to witness to the gospel.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.680]   No, he hears someone reading Isaiah,
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.760]   and his immediate response, the immediacy to God suddenly,
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.480]   is to say, "Do you understand what you're reading?
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.000]   "'Cause if not, I'd love to explain it to you."
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.480]   And the Ethiopian's like, "Dude, come on up, sit with me."
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.120]   And they sit together, and he shares the gospel with him.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.080]   The Ethiopian believes the gospel,
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.280]   repents of his sin, gets baptized,
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.960]   and for all we know, he's the very first African convert
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.080]   to Christianity, and then he's gonna return back to Africa,
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.160]   and a whole continent gets evangelized
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.880]   because of this one moment,
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.320]   because Philip was obedient to the Spirit,
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.760]   was looking for the Spirit, walked with the Spirit,
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.040]   but then was willing to respond with an immediate lead
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   to God suddenly.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.280]   Are you with me?
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.760]   A whole nation comes to faith
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:42.040]   through somebody with that kind of faith.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.800]   Let me close with a story.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.480]   Last week, I shared the story about my mobile phone
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.120]   dying on me in the Camino,
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.440]   and I shared about how bad that was,
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.200]   but I actually only shared half the story with you.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.800]   Let me now share the other half of the story as we close.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.200]   My phone had completely died, broken, gone,
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.160]   and four days into it being busted,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   I was getting more and more frustrated.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.720]   Frustrated I couldn't speak to my wife and daughter,
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.480]   frustrated I couldn't navigate well every day,
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.320]   frustrated I had to rely on everybody else,
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.120]   but my frustrations that day were even more
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.720]   because I'd realized the night before
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.480]   borrowing somebody else's mobile phone
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.160]   that the next mobile phone store
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.440]   was in a city seven days' walk away.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.040]   And so I realized that not only am I facing
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.280]   these first four days, but I'm gonna have another seven days
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.360]   before I can actually get a phone up and running
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.480]   and be able to touch base
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.760]   with the people I needed to touch base with.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.680]   So I was feeling this huge amount of frustration.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.480]   I was walking, really angry at God.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.000]   Anyone been angry at God here?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.840]   Just your pastor, okay.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.560]   So I'm walking, angry at God,
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.840]   and I'd just gone through a village.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.320]   I'd had a rest stop at this village.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.200]   I'd filled up my water and everything,
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.040]   and I was good to go.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.520]   And so I came to this another village,
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.960]   and I was expecting to walk through this village,
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.720]   which happened a lot on the Camino,
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.160]   'cause I'd just stopped, so I didn't need to stop.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.440]   So I was gonna walk through this village.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.840]   And as I'm walking through the village,
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.560]   out of this cafe, this lady goes,
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.600]   "Andrew, come and sit with me."
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.920]   That's how her voice exactly sounded, by the way.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.720]   Just exactly like that.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:04.920]   Anyway, it was this lady, Jane,
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.080]   that I'd met a couple of nights before.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.440]   Didn't know super well at that time.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.000]   I'd met her a couple of nights before.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.280]   But she wanted me to go sit with her.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.720]   The last thing I wanted to do was to stop and sit with her,
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.400]   'cause I'd just stopped in the previous village.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.480]   And in the Camino, there's this unwritten code
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.200]   that if you wave and smile and keep walking,
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.520]   then that just means you wanna keep going.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.920]   And it's not seen as rude.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.200]   So I'm prepared to just wave at her.
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.640]   And I feel like the Holy Spirit speaks to me.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   And the Holy Spirit speaks really strongly,
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.960]   and says, "You need to go sit with her."
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.840]   And I'm like, "Okay."
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.680]   So rather than walk on, I turn around,
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:37.920]   and I sit down with Jane at this cafe.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   And she asked me this question as soon as I sits down.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.760]   It's a really interesting question.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.160]   She said, "If you could change anything about the Camino,
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.320]   "what would you change?"
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.000]   And I said, "Well, right now, I would like to get in a bus,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.320]   "goes down seven days down the road on this bus,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.000]   "get to this place, and buy a mobile phone."
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.720]   And I told her about my story about the mobile phone.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.640]   As I'm talking to her, she's listening to me very gently.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.000]   She gets her backpack out, and she opens up her backpack,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.760]   and she fishes inside the backpack,
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.040]   and she pulls out a mobile phone.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.680]   And she says, she goes, "Andrew, a couple of months ago,
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.960]   "when I was preparing for the Camino,
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.520]   "I felt God tell me to bring a spare mobile phone with me."
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.200]   And she said, "I pushed back on it
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.740]   "because it's carrying extra weight in the bag,
[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.220]   "and you know that nobody wants to carry any extra weight,
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.440]   "but I've been carrying this spare mobile phone
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.660]   "for two weeks in the Camino for no reason
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.520]   "why I was carrying it.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.880]   "Now you've just shared your story with me."
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.480]   She goes, "I think God wants me to give you this phone."
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.280]   And I said, "You are right.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.080]   "He does, don't you, too."
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.800]   Faithful woman, faithful woman.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.920]   Thank you.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.920]   So as I'm taking this phone from her,
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.280]   this other pilgrim walks in.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.120]   He's a German.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.040]   He's like, "Hallo."
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.920]   I don't know how to do Germans.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.640]   I'm not gonna do German accent, but he says,
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.960]   "Can I join you at your table?"
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.800]   And we're like, "Yeah, sure."
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.760]   He's a young German guy, and he comes and sits down,
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.680]   and he's like, "What are you doing?"
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.600]   You know, like he sees us handing phones back and forth.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.520]   It's the worst German accent ever.
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.440]   But he sees us handing phones back and forth,
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   and I say, "Oh, well, you know."
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.440]   And I share the story about everything that happened,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.120]   and his eyes lit up, and he goes, "Oh, back in Germany."
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.600]   He's like, "Back in Germany, I work in a mobile phone store,
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.560]   "and every day, all day long, I take people's old phones,
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.600]   "and I get them up and working on a new phone.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.640]   "If you give me your phone,
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   "and if you take the SIM card out of your old phone,
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.720]   "I will get your phone working in 15 minutes,
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.640]   "and 15 minutes later, I suddenly have
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.720]   "a brand spanking new mobile phone.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.000]   "Isn't that awesome?"
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.920]   So here they are.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   Let me show you a photo of them.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   There they are.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.280]   Now, I will admit to you, I will admit to you
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.600]   that Philip's story is way better than mine,
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.200]   because Philip evangelized a whole nation,
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.240]   and I just got a mobile phone.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.280]   But, but maybe it demonstrates that God works in this way,
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.360]   in big and small ways, and that we never know
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.800]   what it is that God is going to do,
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.840]   but he is orchestrating it all,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.720]   and in times of unchartedness,
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.360]   we can't predict the suddenlies,
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.680]   but we can be prepared to react with the immediatelies.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.800]   And the way we do that is we have to let go
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.960]   of those plans and strategies of what we want
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.360]   or think Jesus should do for us.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.680]   We have to strip ourselves of the when of God,
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.240]   and we have to place ourselves open
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.320]   to receive the power of the Spirit
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.640]   that changes us within us, and prepares us
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.640]   that when the Holy Spirit says go, we go.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.720]   Let me pray for us.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.560]   Let's pray.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.960]   Father, I thank you for each person here in this room,
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.320]   and I thank you for what it is that you're doing
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.640]   in their hearts and in their lives,
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.960]   and I thank you that you have moved them
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.760]   into a season that is uncharted.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:45.040]   And Lord, we have no idea what it is
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.320]   that you're about to do.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.120]   Philip on that day had no idea.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.840]   On that day, I had no idea I was gonna get a new phone.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.320]   And Lord, the people in this room have no idea
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.960]   what tomorrow is going to hold in the adventure
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.120]   and the excitement of an uncharted season.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.280]   But Lord, I wanna pray that we can prepare ourselves
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.920]   for the immediate least, and I wanna pray
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.560]   for each person here in this moment
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.400]   that you would strip away, that you would release, Lord,
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.080]   the things that we are relying on that are not of you.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.160]   Whether that's our own plans, whether that's our desire
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.280]   for the timing and the when of God,
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.320]   whether that's the frustrations because it feels
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.120]   like you're not answering us on the ways
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.680]   and the time where you thought.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.240]   Lord, I believe you wanna strip from people
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.280]   in this room right now just an over-reliance
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.240]   on the things that are only gonna create more frustration
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:40.160]   in the season ahead, and instead, you wanna pour out
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.880]   the power of your Holy Spirit.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.280]   So Lord, I wanna pray for each person here
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.560]   as they release what it is that you're calling them
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.640]   to release here this morning, that they would be filled
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.680]   with the power of God, with the power of God
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.480]   so that they could become your witnesses.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.320]   That they would become public manifestations
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.640]   of the mercy and the grace and the love of Jesus.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.560]   That they would be like Philip, able to react and respond
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.840]   as the Holy Spirit leads without fear.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.720]   So Lord, we come against fear.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.120]   We come against the things that hold us rooted
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.080]   to the known.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.040]   We come against the things that would wanna root us
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.600]   to where things are comfortable for us.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.560]   And Lord, we pray that you would fill us with such power
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.040]   that we wouldn't just see the dramatic things
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.200]   that we would see in these 90 minutes on a Sunday together,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.400]   as great as they are, but it would be the fuel
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.960]   that would drive us outwards.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:46.480]   To the people of this city that you love so much.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.680]   There are so many Ethiopian eunuchs
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.000]   just outside the doors of this community.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.000]   Lord, I pray that you would send your church.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.960]   I pray you would send us, Lord,
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.400]   and that over this sermon series,
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.880]   we would get the values inside of us,
