[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080]   Good morning, everyone, how are you?
[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.080]   You, oh, real human beings.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.400]   You are alive?
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.240]   Yes.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.440]   I cannot, I cannot describe to you
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.320]   how uninteractive it is to speak to a camera.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.420]   And I am so excited that you are breathing,
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.480]   hopefully into your mask and not onto anyone else.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.640]   But you're in this room.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.140]   You are, you could do anything today and I will love you.
[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.080]   You could fall asleep on me
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.600]   and I will love you for being here, okay?
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.800]   That's not an excuse to fall asleep,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.620]   but I'm just letting you know
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.880]   that that is what you could do.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.080]   I am also so glad you are online right now too.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.020]   And our hearts do go out to everybody here.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.560]   We know that right now this vaccine pass is not ideal.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.840]   It is something that we understand.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.280]   We know that a number of you watching
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.400]   are not able to attend in-person services right now.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.640]   And we love you, you are a part of church.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.040]   We are church both here and online.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.760]   In fact, why doesn't everybody turn around,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160]   stare at the camera that is right there
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.760]   and give everybody a wave and say, "Hey, I love you."
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.840]   I love you, right?
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.600]   And I know 'cause I know cameras, they're waving back.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.240]   I can tell that, I can tell that.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.120]   I'm so excited.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.760]   As I was praying about how do we come together today
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.960]   on this day where we reopen for in-person services,
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.080]   I felt strongly the Holy Spirit say, just put on pause
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.400]   the act series, our series called "The Unfinished Story."
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   We're gonna put that on pause for a few weeks
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.360]   because I wanted to speak into some things
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.200]   that I think are really important for us to grapple with,
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.120]   wrestle with as we come back into this emerging
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.240]   out of the fifth wave
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.560]   that we've all been battling right here.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.000]   And I'm calling this, I'm gonna do three weeks with you
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.920]   back to back on this, and we're calling it "Reopened."
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560]   And I know that sounds cheesy
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.040]   'cause we're reopening right now
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.820]   and we're reopening as a society.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.780]   But here's my thought for each one of us.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.400]   The worst thing that can happen
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.080]   is that we reopen our society with closed hearts.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.800]   And I don't know about you,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.840]   but it's been a pretty rough two or three months.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.600]   It's been some pretty tough things that have happened.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.760]   There's been a lot of emotions
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.720]   that I'm sure you in this room are holding.
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.440]   I'll be honest, there's been a lot of emotions in me
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.040]   which you would perhaps classify as not particularly godly.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.060]   There's things I've struggled with,
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.300]   anger I've wrestled with,
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.180]   opinions that I've had about people,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.800]   judgements that I've made about the government
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.460]   and things around me.
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.660]   There is stuff that has gone on in my heart.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.820]   And the worst thing that could happen
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.100]   is to think that we're now reopened
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.460]   and yet there's closure in here.
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.300]   And so I wanna take this next three weeks
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.300]   to speak to you about how you need to reopen your spirit
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.620]   as we emerge out of the fifth wave.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.440]   Because what I do not want is a church.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.840]   And by that, I mean the big C, the Church of Hong Kong,
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.880]   to be filled with people
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.920]   who are happy that the restrictions are down,
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.340]   but are still angry and bitter at everything else.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.160]   I think we need a revival in our spirits
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.700]   and we need to be opened again
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.840]   to the things that the Holy Spirit is doing in this here
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.720]   and this now, and is anybody here?
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.880]   Cameras do not say amen.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.360]   Just pointing that out at the start of my message
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.640]   in case you want to not be a camera today.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.080]   In Jesus name.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.260]   I'm gonna go to,
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.840]   I wanna frame what I'm speaking about today
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.760]   by reading one of my favourite passages of scripture.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.080]   It's a story from Luke.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   Luke is the master storyteller.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.920]   I preach a lot from the gospel of Luke
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.640]   and I wanna preach from my favourite story in Luke.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.320]   I'm like, this is my first Sunday back
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.840]   to preach to real human beings.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.200]   I'm gonna go to my favourite story
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.400]   and preach the heck out of it.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.680]   Are you all right with that?
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.140]   Okay, so.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.200]   I'm so excited, okay.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.040]   Luke 7, starting at verse 36, says this.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.380]   Now, one of the Pharisees invited Jesus
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.960]   to have dinner with him.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.760]   So he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.960]   When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.360]   learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.400]   she brought an alabaster jar of perfume.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.720]   And as she stood behind him at his feet weeping,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.080]   she began to wet his feet with her tears.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.440]   Then she wiped them with her long hair,
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.700]   kissed them and poured perfume on them.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.320]   Now, when the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.120]   this is what he said to himself.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.080]   Well, if this man was truly a prophet,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.920]   he would know who it is that is touching him right now,
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.820]   what kind of woman she is, that she's a sinner.
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.320]   Not the first time in history that a man has judged a woman.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.980]   Jesus answered her, "Simon, I've got something to tell you."
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.200]   You know you're in trouble with Jesus
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.840]   when he says something like that to you, by the way.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.140]   Andrew, I got something to tell you.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.400]   Let me tell you a story, Andrew, about your life, right?
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.920]   "Simon, I got something to tell you.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.840]   Teach me or tell me, teacher," he said.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.160]   Well, there are two men
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.600]   and they owed money to a certain money lender.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.380]   One owed 500 denarii and the other owed 50.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.800]   Now, neither of them had the money to pay them back.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.600]   So he cancelled the debts of both of them.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.680]   Now, here's the question, which of them will love him more?
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.200]   Simon reluctantly perhaps replied,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.820]   "Well, I suppose the one who had the bigger debt cancelled."
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.360]   "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.500]   And then he turned towards the woman and he said to Simon,
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.880]   "Do you see this woman?
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]   I came into your house
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.120]   and you did not give me any water for my feet,
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.240]   but she wet my feet with her tears
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.360]   and wiped them with her hair.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.880]   You did not give me a kiss,
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.960]   but this woman from the time that I entered
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.920]   has not stopped kissing my feet.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.320]   You did not put oil on my head,
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.880]   but she has poured perfume on my feet.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.360]   Therefore, I tell you, her many sins,"
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.440]   notice this, "she has and had many sins.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.720]   There are many sins, they are forgiven.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.360]   For she loved much,
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.240]   but he who has been forgiven little," note this,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.280]   loves little.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.360]   Then Jesus said these words to her,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.840]   "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.600]   Father, as we open up this passage this morning,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.400]   I am so grateful that we are emerging here
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.440]   in this fifth wave, that we are reopening society.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.760]   We're grateful that we can gather in person in this room
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.580]   as well as online in this moment.
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.640]   But Father, we want to capture what is on your heart
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.240]   in this season and in this time.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.360]   Lord, I believe you've got a word in season for us
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.800]   as a church.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.360]   And as we open up this incredible story
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.340]   of a woman, Father, I want to pray
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.320]   that you would open our hearts.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.480]   Lord, I believe that each one of us,
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.800]   myself included in this room,
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.200]   we need to be reopened today
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   to your tender and yet focused move of your Spirit in us.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.560]   Father, would you come by your Spirit, move upon us all.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.720]   And we thank you for this.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.640]   And everybody in the room and online says,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.000]   "When I was nine years old,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.400]   I woke up in the middle of the night
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.080]   with the worst stomach ache I had ever experienced.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.240]   It was excruciating pain.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.660]   It was so painful that I wondered
[00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.740]   whether I would still be able to continue to breathe.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.320]   And it was the middle of the night
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.120]   and my parents' bedroom was down the corridor from mine.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.960]   And I fell out of bed and I walked as gingerly
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.120]   like this as possible to my parents' bedroom.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.300]   I opened the door and I walked in
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.080]   and my mom's there snoring and I shake her.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.160]   And she grudgingly kind of like wakes up
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   and I'm like, "Mom, my stomach's on fire."
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.560]   Now, if you're a parent in this room,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.840]   you will know that there is a universal thing
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.520]   that takes place in kids
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.080]   when they want to get a day off school.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.480]   And that universal thing is to pretend
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.120]   they have a stomach ache,
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.040]   because you can never prove
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.340]   whether they have the stomach ache or not.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.020]   And it's a good one for kids.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.160]   And parents know this the world over.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.480]   And at midnight, my mom turns over
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.160]   and through her sleepy eyes, and she says,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.560]   (moans)
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.480]   She was at the first service, by the way, it was classic.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.320]   Anyway.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.520]   (moans)
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.560]   And you, if you're still feeling funny in the morning,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.280]   we'll talk about it then.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   (snores)
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.620]   I get back to my bedroom for an hour.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.560]   I try to sleep.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.520]   I can't sleep.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.640]   My stomach is literally on fire.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.940]   I'm having trouble breathing.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.240]   I'm in so much pain.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.840]   About an hour later, I fall out of the bed.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.640]   This time I crawl to my parents' bedroom.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.880]   I open the door.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.120]   I scream as loud as I can
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.800]   and dramatically fall on my back
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.240]   in the middle of the bedroom.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.280]   My parents figured that
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.000]   there must be actually something wrong with me.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.580]   So they scoop me up in their hands.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.620]   They go to the car.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.040]   We drive to the nearest hospital to the A and E.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.880]   The doctor takes one look at me and he goes,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.080]   "I think you've got a problem with your appendix."
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.260]   And my parents are like, "I guess it's not about school."
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.220]   (audience laughs)
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.020]   And the doctor said, "We're gonna have to take you now
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.940]   into emergency surgery."
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.760]   And they give me this drug called codeine,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.460]   which is supposed to kill pain,
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.380]   but it made me feel even weirder and worse.
[00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.740]   And they rushed me straight into surgery.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.800]   They remove my appendix.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.540]   They zip me back up.
[00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.400]   Apparently they said to my parents just a little bit later
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.180]   that if they hadn't removed my appendix that hour,
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.140]   I would have died 'cause it would have ruptured.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.720]   Couple of hours later, I wake up in the hospital room
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.280]   and minus my appendix.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   And I'm still in a huge amount of pain.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.240]   And I'm still feeling really strange.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.360]   And there's just a lot of pain in this air.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.760]   And I say to the doctors, "I'm still in pain."
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.240]   And they think that's weird.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.040]   And so they're like, "Well, give him some more codeine,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.880]   this drug."
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.000]   And so they pump more codeine into me.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.280]   Now, I suddenly find out a few hours later
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.080]   that I'm allergic to codeine.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.980]   Now, this is the thing about allergies.
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.860]   What is it about?
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.680]   Why did God create allergies?
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.520]   Here's the weird thing about allergies.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.320]   You only know you're allergic
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.680]   when you actually have the thing that you're allergic to.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.600]   Are you with me?
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.680]   Like babies should be born with a list.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.480]   Here are all the things Andrew was allergic to.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.080]   Please avoid these for the rest of his life.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.200]   That's not the way it works, right?
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.800]   So they pump all this drug into me, this codeine,
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.520]   and my body's allergic to it.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.360]   We didn't know it.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.240]   We find that out.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   My whole body erupts in pain, ejecting this drug.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320]   And what should have been a relatively easy fix
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.880]   meant that there was so much trauma
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.000]   in the area that my appendix had been in,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.520]   and in the drugs that had been now in my system,
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   that I was for five days in desperate fight for my life.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.400]   My mom and dad would visit me in the hospital,
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.240]   and I would walk down to try to get some exercise
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.060]   when I was feeling up to it.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.840]   I had my IV drip and I was wearing one of those smocks
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.240]   that has open in the back, right?
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.760]   It wasn't a good sign.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.880]   I was nine years old walking around the hospital.
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.800]   My parents thought I was an old man.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.720]   They walked past me the first time they came to visit me.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.760]   I was in so much pain.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.000]   There was so much need for healing in the trauma
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.720]   of the area where the appendix had been removed.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.640]   But after about six days or so,
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.840]   I was released from the hospital and I went home,
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.200]   but I still wasn't feeling myself.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.460]   And it was about another month or so
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.460]   before I returned to my full health,
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.100]   before I really felt like myself again.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.200]   The whole experience was absolutely harrowing.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.680]   It was a harrowing experience,
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.060]   but I learned in it a valuable life lesson.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.580]   And as I was praying about what it is
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.660]   that we need to talk about,
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.860]   that we need to speak about
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.260]   as we reopen our in-person services,
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.780]   as the city reopens out of this fifth wave,
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.000]   it was this life lesson that the Lord led me to.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.120]   And it's a life lesson I wanna share with you now.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.800]   It's this, that the removal of the problem
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.220]   is not necessarily the healing.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.760]   Come on, church.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.760]   The removal of the problem is not necessarily the healing.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.040]   For the appendix, which had almost ruptured,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.560]   that was inflamed and was bad,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.640]   needed to be removed from me.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.140]   And it was, but that wasn't actually
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.420]   the fullness of my healing.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.020]   That appendix had created so much trauma
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.820]   in the other organs around it.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.340]   And the drugs that they had put in me
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.100]   had created such a dramatic experience in me
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.300]   that my healing journey was a much longer journey
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.220]   than simply removing the one thing that was the problem
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.100]   that had kick-started all the things
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.140]   that were happening in my body.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.380]   And I realised in that experience
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.760]   that so often we forget this in life.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.580]   We think that if we just remove the problem,
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.380]   then everything else is gonna go fine.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.820]   That we don't realise that actually
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.660]   when the appendix is taken,
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.260]   there's still a journey of dealing with the trauma
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.940]   that is inside of us.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.820]   We need to understand that the experience of our healing
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.540]   and the place of our hope
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.700]   is not found in the removal of the problem.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.300]   It's found in processing the trauma caused by the problem.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.620]   Come on cameras, wake up.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.380]   I need you with me.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.500]   Amen.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.740]   It's actually found in the processing of the trauma
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.980]   that the problem caused in the first place.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.200]   And we gather here today, man, I'm excited.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.820]   We're celebrating.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.740]   We're celebrating that because of the lifting
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.020]   of some social distancing measures.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.900]   We're able now to gather in person if we're vaccinated.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.140]   We're celebrating the reality
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.100]   that actually the government is changing
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.860]   some of the travel restrictions,
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.300]   that we only have seven days now in quarantine
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.340]   rather than 21.
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.340]   Gonna have an amen for that.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.940]   We just heard this week, come on babies.
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.580]   We just heard this week that in May,
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.820]   foreigners will be able to come to Hong Kong.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.020]   So if you've got family that live overseas,
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.180]   they can now come to Hong Kong
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.020]   if they're willing to have seven days in a hotel
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.500]   and be a part of us again.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.100]   That's good news.
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.020]   We're also knowing and seeing
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.100]   that COVID cases are coming down every day.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.220]   We're now just seeing a couple of hundred cases.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.340]   That's a great thing.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.220]   A lot of businesses have reopened and this is so good.
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.820]   We have a lot of small business owners
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.240]   in our community here at the Vine,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.380]   people that own gyms and restaurants.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.920]   Those things now are open again.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.340]   Restaurants can go into the night.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.220]   We can all eat dinner together again.
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.900]   Four of us looking at each other in the eyes without masks.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.500]   This is all good stuff that we celebrate,
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.340]   but here's the danger.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.460]   The danger is in all of that celebration,
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.380]   we think that the removal of the problem
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.260]   is where our healing happens.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.500]   It's where we think that if Hong Kong
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.260]   can just lift the social distancing restrictions,
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.500]   if COVID could just go away,
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.460]   that I will enter back into another stage
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.860]   of flourishing of life.
[00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:30.140]   And the reality is there's trauma you need to process.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.500]   The reality is there's stuff that's going on
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.760]   in each one of us.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.380]   It's been a difficult three years
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.380]   from the summer of 2019 to now.
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.860]   It's been a really hard time.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.940]   And each one of us in this room,
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.100]   we're dealing with hardship, with anxiety, grief,
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.620]   things that we're struggling with,
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.180]   anger, frustration, fear.
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.640]   We're wondering where our future is.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.380]   Some of us are wondering, do we stay in Hong Kong or not?
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.000]   We're wrestling with the government,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.080]   wondering when things might change,
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.220]   when actually restrictions and things might shift.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.700]   We're in a place where we're feeling all of those emotions
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.300]   and we have to be super careful
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.880]   that we don't equate our flourishing
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.740]   to the decision of some change
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.540]   in some social distancing measures.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.820]   Because if we do that, here's what will happen.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.340]   We will reopen society with closed hearts.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:27.260]   We will reopen Hong Kong with traumatic, broken people,
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.380]   people in desperate need of more than just
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.800]   less than 14 days in a hotel quarantine,
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.960]   people who are actually in need
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.280]   of the thing that we gather here today to celebrate,
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.120]   the Spirit of God working in us,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.080]   renewing, redeeming, and filling us and changing us.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.040]   And the question we should have is,
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.840]   how do we receive that kind of healing?
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.920]   'Cause I don't know about you,
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.320]   but I don't wanna put a band-aid on my COVID trauma.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.340]   I don't wanna just think that I can zip it up,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.160]   remove the appendix and everything's gonna be fine.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.800]   I wanna dig into the realities
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.040]   that I know that my emotions go deeper than that.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.600]   I know the things that I've been frustrated
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.440]   and angry with go deeper than that.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.000]   And Lord, if you don't heal that,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.920]   I might be freer in society,
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.020]   but I am still bound in chains inside of me.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.960]   I wonder if anybody else might feel
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.660]   a bit like that in the room today.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.440]   How do we not put a band-aid on our COVID trauma?
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.120]   Well, I think the story we're looking at today
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.120]   gives us some answers to that.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.960]   It's one of my favourite stories, as I said earlier,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.280]   I love this moment.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.880]   Luke is a master storyteller,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.500]   and he tells this story so beautifully.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.480]   It's a story of two individuals
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.020]   that could not be more different.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.760]   We're introduced to the first, he's a Pharisee.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.080]   His name is Simon.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.680]   If you wanna think about the male privilege
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.080]   of the first century, Simon is your man.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.160]   He's a man of power in the story.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.960]   He's a law-abiding Pharisee, a good guy.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.840]   He's the guy that all the other Jews look up to
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.280]   and wanna emulate.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.760]   He's the person that people look to
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.680]   as the ones that will bring in the Messiah
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.040]   whenever the Messiah arrives.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.640]   The Pharisees were loved for their obedience to the law
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.900]   and the way that they operated in society.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.160]   And they were looked up to and worshipped.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.560]   And here's Simon.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.400]   He's opened up his home to welcome in
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.600]   this travelling rabbi, Jesus.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   And Luke contrasts this power man, Simon, with a woman.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:40.480]   The woman is never named in the story.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.680]   It's interesting, right?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:45.080]   And Luke introduces us to her
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.240]   by telling us one simple thing.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.480]   She had lived a sinful life in that town.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.120]   That's the way he describes her.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.000]   She's lived a sinful life in that town.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.880]   Here's the thing you need to know.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.400]   The word that Luke uses for sinful here is a rare word.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.280]   There's actually a number of Greek words for sin or sinful.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.280]   This one is one of the rarest words.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.400]   And Luke, although he uses the word sin a lot
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.200]   in both Luke and Acts, it's only used twice.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.760]   This particular version is only ever used twice by Luke.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.480]   The other time that it's used, other than this story,
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.220]   is when Peter first comes into contact with Jesus.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.120]   That moment when Peter's on the boat
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.680]   and they fished all night and Jesus is sitting there
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.040]   and he says, "Throw the nets on the other side of the boat."
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.840]   And the fishermen, including Peter, are like,
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.000]   "Dude, we're the fishermen, you're a wandering rabbi.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.960]   "We've been fishing all night.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.800]   "What do you mean?"
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.760]   He's like, "Just throw your nets on the other side."
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.760]   They throw their nets on the other side.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.440]   They cannot pull the nets in
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.120]   because of the massive catch of fish.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.720]   And here's Peter's reaction.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.880]   He knows in that moment that this Jesus
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.680]   is who he says he is.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.380]   He knows he's a prophet.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.820]   He knows he's greater than anyone he's ever met.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:56.780]   And Peter's sitting there facing Jesus, he says this.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.020]   He says, "Get away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man."
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.140]   It's the same word, sinful.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.060]   The word in Greek means this.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.980]   It means I recognise I've done some wrong things
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.680]   in the past and I have remorse of them.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.580]   That's specifically what this word means.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.620]   And Luke takes that word and applies it to the woman
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.040]   right up front because he's trying to teach you something.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.200]   He wants you to know right at the start of his story
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.440]   that this woman has done some bad things in her past.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.640]   She feels remorse for them
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.360]   and she is not now defined by them.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:36.560]   He wants you not to judge her on the actions of her past.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.720]   He wants you to see what she does in the present.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.800]   And this is really interesting
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.000]   'cause church history has got this wrong.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.840]   Church history that is mostly written by men
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.660]   have declared that this woman is a prostitute.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.500]   That's what most commentaries will tell you
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.340]   if you read a commentary about this story.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.660]   They'll say, "Well, this woman was obviously a prostitute."
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.720]   It's the same word applied to Peter.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.120]   So are we saying that Peter's also a prostitute?
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.900]   Maybe.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.220]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.100]   It's my staff over there, so proud of them.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.260]   (congregation laughing)
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.220]   So proud.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.500]   Bible school.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.840]   But I want you to catch this, right?
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.080]   Catch this, come with me.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.520]   Luke is trying to tell this story
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.320]   so that we're not judging this woman
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.600]   based on some past expectation.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.120]   There's nothing in this text
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.440]   that says she's a sexual sinner at all.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.440]   It just says she's done some bad things in her past.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.000]   She feels remorse for them.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.760]   What he wants you to focus on
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.200]   is what she does in that moment.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.040]   And in verses 37 and 38, he unpacks that for you.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.680]   He says, "Oh, she comes in.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.280]   She hears Jesus is in town.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.600]   She rushes into the house.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.840]   She's not invited.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.040]   She goes straight in and she goes to his feet
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.840]   'cause he's reclining at a table.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.920]   And she wets his feet with her tears
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.000]   and she wipes them with her hair.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.240]   And she kisses him all the time on his feet.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.720]   And she pours this expensive perfume on him.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.560]   Why?
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.040]   Because she's worshipping.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.520]   She's not doing something sexual.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.240]   She's not trying to seduce him.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.760]   She's not trying to be intimate.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.920]   This is worship, gratitude.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.600]   The expression of the love that is so abundant
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.880]   that she will break tradition.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   She wasn't supposed to be in the room.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.680]   She was not invited as a woman to that room.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.680]   She did not care because she had to say, "Thank you."
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.800]   I love it.
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.140]   Church history calls her the sinful woman.
[00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.380]   I refuse to call somebody the name
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.700]   of something they've done in the past,
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.920]   but I wanna call people based on who they are today.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.240]   She's not the sinful woman.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.960]   She's the anointing woman.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.120]   Are you with me?
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.640]   Can we hear her roar?
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.920]   Simon failed to hear her roar.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.320]   Simon, in fact, saw what she did.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.800]   And although he doesn't say anything out loud,
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   Luke captures for us what he says in his head.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.080]   He basically goes like this.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.920]   He's like, "Pfft.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.440]   "I can't believe this woman.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.600]   "I mean, if Jesus truly was a prophet,
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.160]   "if this guy really was who he claims to be,
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.900]   "who the crowds claim him to be,
[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.360]   "he would know the kind of woman
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.020]   "that is touching his feet right now.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.840]   "He would know that she is a sinner."
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.200]   Which is really interesting 'cause Simon in that moment
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.740]   is not just judging the woman based on her past behaviour
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.640]   or her reputation in the town.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.160]   He's judging Jesus as well.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.360]   Are you following me?
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.920]   He's judging both people in the same time.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.200]   He's cynical, he's judgmental,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.080]   and he's reaching out in that negative judgmentalism.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.080]   And Jesus knows this, which is the irony of the story.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.440]   The man doesn't think that Jesus is a prophet.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.920]   Jesus is about to prove that he really is a prophet
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.220]   'cause he knows exactly what Simon's thinking.
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.400]   And you need to understand this,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.240]   that the sinner at this mill is not the woman,
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.080]   but it's Simon.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.900]   'Cause Simon is the one who's judging.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.080]   Simon is the one who's feeling pride in his heart.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.920]   Simon is the one who's casting judgment
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.360]   on somebody's actions.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.040]   And Jesus understands all of this.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.580]   And so Jesus does whatever Jesus does best.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.060]   And that is, let me tell you a story.
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.480]   And he tells him the story about this guy,
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.440]   this money lender.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.280]   He gives out this money
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.960]   and there's this big debt and small debt.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.120]   And then he cancels the debts
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.520]   of everybody he's given money to.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.000]   And he asked Simon, "Who is going to be more happy?
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.520]   Who is going to love this money lender more?"
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.840]   And Simon, by this point, realises he is in a corner.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.080]   He realises Jesus has got the better of him.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.720]   And he says to him, "Well, I suppose the one
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.040]   who got the greater debt cancelled."
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.080]   And Jesus says these cheeky words.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   This is cheeky Jesus.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.800]   I love cheeky Jesus.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.600]   Jesus says this, "You have judged correctly
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.640]   for the first time tonight,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   'cause you've been judging incorrectly the whole evening.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.840]   But now you judge correctly.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.760]   And in judging correctly, Simon, you've sealed your fate."
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:24.340]   'Cause Jesus says, "Do you see this woman?"
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.000]   He's not going, "Do you see this woman?"
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.300]   He's going, "What do you see when you see this woman?
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.940]   Do you see her reputation?
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.160]   Do you see the things that you think that she's done?
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.600]   Or do you see what she has done in this moment?"
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.080]   And it's powerful because he goes into
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:43.920]   exactly what she's done.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.240]   Let me read this to you in verses 44 to 46.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.480]   Is everybody okay?
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.760]   Online, are you okay?
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.520]   Oh, good.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.080]   He says, "Do you see this woman?
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.160]   I came into your house.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.240]   You did not give me any water for my feet,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.040]   but she wet my feet with her tears
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.480]   and wiped them with her hair.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.120]   You did not give me a kiss,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.760]   but this woman from the time that I entered
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.360]   has not stopped kissing my feet.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.360]   You did not put oil on my head,
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.640]   but she has poured perfume on my feet."
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.520]   He goes through this list of things
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.120]   that Simon could have done for him, but did not do.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.800]   Now, it's really important you understand
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.260]   that Simon was under no legal obligation
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.940]   to do any of those things.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.260]   There was no legal obligation 'cause he's a Pharisee.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.720]   If there had been a legal obligation,
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:25.160]   he would have done it.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.300]   There was no legal obligation
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.040]   for him to treat a guest that way.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.360]   Oh, here's a bowl for your feet.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.520]   Oh, give you a kiss on the entry.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.820]   Oh, let me put some oil in your hair
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.760]   'cause you've been out in the dusty Galilee all day, right?
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.980]   A host would do those things if they truly honoured
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.640]   and valued the guests they were inviting to their dinner.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.760]   It wasn't this standard thing.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.280]   It was the above and beyond.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.420]   Simon is pictured here basically two things,
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.920]   doing the bare minimum of the law to keep the law.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.400]   And secondly, not valuing or understanding who Jesus is.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.120]   So when Jesus says, "Do you see this woman?"
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.920]   What Jesus is actually also saying to Simon is,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.420]   "Because she sees me."
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.840]   She understands the value.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.240]   She understands what I have done for her.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.340]   She understands all of the things
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.200]   that I am about to do for Israel.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.800]   You failed to do that because you did not give me a water.
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.200]   You did not give me a kiss.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.080]   You gave me no perfume on entry.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.880]   You did not do any of the things that you would have done
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.440]   if you believe that somebody of honour and worth
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.400]   and value had entered your house.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.760]   And the question we have to ask ourselves is,
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.360]   "Why does Simon, the lorabying Pharisee, get it all wrong,
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.080]   but the woman who's lived a life of sin get it all right?"
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.740]   And the answer to that is found in her healing.
[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.400]   Because she understands that the removal of a problem
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.840]   is not necessarily always the healing.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.420]   Notice where her healing comes from.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.560]   Here's Jesus beautifully in verse 46 and 47 and eight.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.880]   "Therefore I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.800]   for she loved much, but he who has been forgiven little
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.240]   loves little."
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   Jesus makes this incredible connection for this woman here.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.280]   He says, "You wanna know why she's doing those things?
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.400]   She's doing them because she has experienced forgiveness."
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.320]   And not just experienced forgiveness,
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.920]   but experienced forgiveness at such a deep level
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.600]   that it is literally transformed
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.040]   and renewed her identity and her life.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.280]   She is not the same person that she was a month ago,
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.360]   two months ago, five months ago, a year ago.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.400]   Yes, she has lived a hard life.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   Yes, she has made some mistakes,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.840]   but she is remorseful for them.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.680]   Why?
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.720]   Because she's understood there's a God who forgives
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.640]   and redeems and restores and renews.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.280]   And she's allowed that forgiveness,
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.480]   not to put a bandaid over her sin,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.420]   but to come and gouge out the trauma of her life
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.840]   so that she's so new and restored
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.680]   that she's willing to bust into a house
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.280]   that she was not invited to.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.000]   She's willing to go in front of a Pharisee
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.880]   who's supposed to be the person in power
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:00.240]   and humble herself and worship Jesus.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   She is so forgiven that she is able to love.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:13.200]   And Jesus is saying to Simon, "Can you love like that?"
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.280]   Jesus says these words to her.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.480]   He says, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.340]   It's tempting when we read that to think
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.240]   that because of her actions in that moment,
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.000]   Jesus declares that her sins are forgiven.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.280]   That's really bad theology,
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.080]   and you need to be careful of that.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.660]   We don't earn the forgiveness of God
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.280]   by our good righteous actions.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.180]   We don't wash feet in order to be forgiven.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.040]   We don't pour out expensive perfume
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.280]   in the hope that God might turn His heart to us
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.140]   and forgive us.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.960]   The word for your sins are forgiven here
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.400]   is in the perfect tense in the Greek.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.160]   The perfect tense basically means this.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.880]   It means there's been an action in the past
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.120]   that has an implication on the present.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.200]   So what he's saying to her is,
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.840]   "Your sins were forgiven in the past."
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.200]   In other words, he's declaring to her and to Simon
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.140]   and everybody else in that room in that moment
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.680]   that this woman has experienced forgiveness before.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.560]   And because she knows that she has been forgiven before,
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.600]   she is so filled with love that she's come here today
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.040]   to do these things, not in order to get forgiveness,
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.240]   but because she has been forgiven.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.520]   Her extravagant act of love
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.240]   is not the cause of her forgiveness,
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.120]   it's the response to her forgiveness.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:26.960]   Are you with me?
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.040]   And Jesus is making this point
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.680]   so that Simon would understand
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.480]   something that's so fundamental and so true,
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.760]   that there is a direct link
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.520]   between our ability to receive forgiveness
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.840]   and the healing that that creates in us,
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   and our ability to actually offer true love to others.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.240]   Jesus is saying there's a link between forgiveness and love.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.440]   One of the most powerful things as human beings
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.240]   that we can understand is that link.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.080]   Jesus says, literally,
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.320]   "Those that have been forgiven much, love much.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.400]   Those that have been forgiven so little, love little."
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.580]   This is Jesus opening up a healing journey for Simon.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.260]   Jesus understands that the removal of a problem
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.460]   is not necessarily the healing,
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.060]   but the healing actually needs to go deeper than that.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.380]   But the healing that we all need
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:26.380]   is only found in the power of a forgiving God,
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.100]   and in our deep understanding of that forgiveness.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.260]   I'm sure this woman was not proud of some of the mistakes
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.860]   and things that she had done in her life,
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.620]   but she could love extravagantly
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.900]   because she had first been loved,
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.020]   because God had poured out His love
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.820]   in the power of forgiveness in her,
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.420]   and that changed everything about her.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.660]   And here's the thing for us here in Hong Kong.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.340]   I tell you this, Hong Kong is in need of healing, amen?
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.300]   It's in need of the redeeming
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   and restoring healing love of God.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.860]   You are in need of the healing love of God.
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.180]   And I wanna say it as strong as this.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.460]   There will be no healing for Hong Kong.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.500]   There will be no true restoration for the social unrest
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.700]   and the pandemic unless the church
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.900]   can become a vessel of God's love again.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:20.300]   And the only way we become a vessel of God's love
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.700]   is through the doorway of forgiveness.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.300]   And you're tempted sitting here to think,
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.140]   because things are reopening,
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.820]   my life will be able to flourish again.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.820]   And I'm here to tell you as hard as this word is,
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.260]   that the only way your life is going to flourish
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.980]   out of the back of these three years
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.180]   that we've all experienced
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.300]   is if you allow a bit more forgiveness into your life.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.420]   If you allow yourself to process
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.380]   some of the trauma that you're feeling.
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.420]   If you stop and say,
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   "I will not put a band-aid on how I am right now.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:00.340]   "Holy Spirit come, because I need to be forgiven."
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:05.860]   We need to be forgiven of our words, of our attitudes.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.500]   We need to be forgiven of our judgmental negativity.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.700]   This is the interesting thing to me.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.700]   I think the great danger for us emerging
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.300]   from this fifth wave is this,
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.540]   that we would emerge more like Simon
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.420]   and less like the anointing woman.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.260]   And we will emerge that way
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.220]   because we haven't dealt with the things
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.740]   that really need to be dealt with.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.260]   And we will become more judgmental
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.460]   because there's stuff inside of us that has been difficult,
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.780]   because there have been decisions made
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.780]   that have rightly annoyed us,
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.140]   because we haven't been able to do some of the things
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.380]   that we'd wanted to do.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.940]   And those things are true and real
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.940]   for every single one of us.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.860]   And they create frustration and anger
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.340]   and all this thing inside of us.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.420]   And if we're not careful,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.020]   we're going to be more like Simon,
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:58.740]   judging the people around us, judging the government,
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.740]   judging individuals, judging the church,
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.820]   judging our boss, judging our businesses,
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:05.620]   judging everything, being cynical and critical.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.740]   Because we haven't dealt with the trauma that's real in us.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:15.060]   And Jesus says to Simon, "Do you see this woman?
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:21.140]   She loves extravagantly because she's been forgiven deeply."
[00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.220]   And as you emerge from this fifth wave,
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:29.700]   let me gently say to you, do you see that woman too?
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.460]   Are you willing to open yourself up this week
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.460]   and over the next three weeks to be reopened
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.620]   to the healing work that God needs to do in your life?
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.020]   And it starts with forgiveness.
[00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.900]   Forgiveness for the things that I have done.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.180]   Asking God to forgive me for my brokenness
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.300]   and for my thoughts and my actions.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.460]   Forgiving myself,
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.580]   because that's sometimes the hardest person to forgive.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.300]   And then going to others that I've hurt or wronged
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.780]   and asking for their forgiveness.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.740]   And then in that, forgiving and releasing others.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.420]   Jesus in scripture connects forgiving
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.380]   to the year of blessing.
[00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.220]   The year of blessing, the year of Jubilee.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.220]   That was always about release of three things.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.260]   Debt, the full release of debt,
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.700]   which is the story that Jesus connects us to.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.380]   The second thing was the release of the land.
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.140]   Anybody who'd been taken away from their land
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.860]   can go back to their land and own it again.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.820]   The third thing was released from slavery.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.020]   I want you to know that your forgiveness,
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.740]   your act of forgiveness will release you
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.260]   from the debt that you carry.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.580]   It'll plant you firmly in the ground again
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.300]   for a place of flourishing.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.660]   And it will break the slavery you're feeling right now
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.980]   to your emotions and your brokenness
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.020]   and the anger and the fear and the anxiety.
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.460]   That's what forgiveness does.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.580]   It releases.
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:54.420]   Would we be released to truly be a church of love?
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.140]   'Cause the only way this city will heal
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.820]   is with the love of God.
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.380]   And the only way the love of God will come
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.660]   is if the people of God know they're forgiven.
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.060]   Let's do the work so that we can be the people
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.060]   God calls us to be.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.860]   I want to have you just close your eyes with me
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.700]   and open your hands.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.540]   I want to pray.
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:21.460]   Holy Spirit, we are so grateful.
[00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:27.340]   So grateful, God, for this season we're in.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.220]   We're grateful for the lifting of these measures,
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.540]   for the fact that we can gather in this room again today.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.100]   What a wonderful thing that is.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:41.100]   Father, we're grateful for your hand on our city.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.180]   We're grateful for the many mercies
[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.460]   that there have been in the last three months.
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.580]   Father, we're also aware of the challenges
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.900]   and the emotions that those things have created in us.
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.300]   Father, we would be wrong to reopen society
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:36:59.420]   with closed hearts.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.940]   So Holy Spirit, I pray right now
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.380]   for every person in this room.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:08.260]   Lord, where our hearts are more like Simon,
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:14.900]   where we find ourselves critical, cynical, frustrated.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:23.700]   Father, we don't need more Simons in Hong Kong.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.340]   But Father, for us to shift from Simon to the woman,
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.460]   we need forgiveness.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.460]   We need to encounter that same power of love
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.340]   and forgiveness that she encountered.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.740]   And we need her to come and truly do the work in our hearts
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.020]   'cause the removal of the problem
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.540]   is not necessarily the healing,
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.820]   but the healing comes through the processing of the trauma.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.580]   And Lord, would you teach us how we do that?
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.660]   And we know that it begins in forgiveness.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.820]   I want you to take a moment right now,
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.620]   maybe if you're comfortable,
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.940]   just open your hands where you're sitting.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.500]   If this is speaking to you,
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.860]   if you wanna respond this morning,
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.740]   it's just a simple thing online or in this room,
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.860]   just open your hands.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.940]   By opening your hands, it's not anything special,
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.980]   but it's just a posture of receiving.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:15.620]   And the Holy Spirit really honors your heart
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.060]   and he sees where you're at.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:24.660]   And I believe that you need forgiveness.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.460]   (gentle music)
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.940]   And I want you just to allow the Holy Spirit
[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.820]   to search your heart and show you what areas
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.020]   he wants you to deal with today.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.100]   There'll be some other areas tomorrow and next week,
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.500]   but in this moment,
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.820]   see the Holy Spirit is a kind, gentle person
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.580]   that leads us to repentance.
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:52.380]   The woman was not perfect.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.940]   (gentle music)
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.180]   She knew she had done some really bad things.
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.460]   Peter was not perfect.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.860]   He knew he had done some really bad things.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.380]   But what made the difference between them
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:11.300]   and Simon in this story was forgiveness and love.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.980]   I pray right now by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.880]   that Lord, you would move in forgiveness over this church.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.940]   Lord, I pray you would move in forgiveness
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.640]   over every individual here today.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.220]   Father, we need it.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.020]   And Father, we thank you that in your forgiveness
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.100]   comes what we see in this woman's life,
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.860]   love, joy, gratitude.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:40.780]   And so Lord, I pray that as we have this time
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.700]   of forgiveness in your spirit,
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.860]   out of that would emerge a celebration in our hearts
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.900]   and a love that this city so desperately needs.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.340]   That it wouldn't be a fake love
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.900]   that we try to stir up as a church,
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.580]   but it would flow from the place of forgiveness.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.340]   So take a moment,
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.260]   and in a moment the band will come and lead us,
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.100]   but just take a moment now, don't rush this.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.740]   So allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you beautifully.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.780]   He loves you deeply.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.660]   He's not angry at you.
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.940]   He's not Simon.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.060]   He's not judging you.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.540]   He's Jesus.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.500]   And He's saying, "Do you see this woman?
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.540]   That could be you too.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.260]   Come to me.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:27.340]   Come to me."
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.780]   (gentle music)
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.360]   (gentle music)
