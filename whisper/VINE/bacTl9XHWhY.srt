1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 You know, when I stop for a moment and think about the incredible things, the blessings

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,560
 that have been brought into our lives because of Christ, I can't help but stop in my busy

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,680
 life and actually just worship Him like we were doing just a moment ago, just giving

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,480
 Him honor and giving Him praise.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,800
 I mean, stop for a moment and think about what He has done in your life.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,420
 You have been handpicked before the creation of this world, handpicked by God to be in

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,320
 relationship with Him.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,580
 I mean, think about that for a moment.

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:43,040
 He has chosen you as an act of grace, chosen you not because you earned it, not because

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,160
 you deserve it, but because out of His great love, He wanted to be in relationship with

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,280
 you.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,320
 I think of this a little bit like my wife and I and our daughter, Mia.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,240
 God has adopted you into His family.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,680
 You know, Mia, our daughter, she didn't choose Chris and I.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,680
 Chris and I chose her, and in choosing her, she ended up coming into relationship with

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,160
 us and choosing us.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,860
 And in the same way, you didn't choose God.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,900
 God chose you, and in choosing you, you have now come into a relationship where you are

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,120
 now choosing Him and walking with Him, and that's a profound thing, not because you've

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,160
 earned it or deserved it, because He acted first.

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,280
 And here is how He chose you.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,240
 He sent His only Son to die on a cross for all of your sin and all of your brokenness,

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,000
 to stand in the gap to create unity between you and reconciliation between you and God

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 once again.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,160
 He did that out of just a place of love and grace.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,560
 And the reason why He's done that is He wants you to understand what His greater purpose,

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,360
 what His greater will is in this world.

29
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,920
 Here's His will, that everything on heaven and on earth would all come together under

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,080
 one person, that person being Jesus Christ.

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,760
 Again, think about that for a second, that everything in this world, everything that

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,880
 is being created would come under one authority, the person of Jesus Christ.

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,280
 I mean, that should just blow your mind.

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,560
 Think about all the things He has done personally for you.

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,680
 He has chosen you, He has adopted you, He has saved you, He has filled you with His

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,960
 power of His Spirit, and He sent you out to be His hands and feet in the world.

37
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,300
 That, my friends, is purely grace.

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,180
 And because of all of that, here's how I pray for you.

39
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,120
 I pray that you wouldn't just believe in God, but that you would actually live a life

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,000
 that would show the world what that belief truly means to you.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,280
 I pray that you would come to a knowledge of God, or knowledge of all of these incredible

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,240
 things that He has done for you on your behalf by His grace.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,620
 I pray that the eyes of your heart would be opened so you would come to a realization

44
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,720
 of the inheritance that you have as a believer in Jesus.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,040
 You would come to understand, because the eyes of your heart have been opened, that

46
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,240
 you would see the hope to which you have been called as a Christian.

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,200
 This hope that everything that God has created in the world, all authorities and powers and

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,520
 principalities, that all of these things sit under Christ Jesus.

49
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,480
 That there is nothing above Jesus.

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,220
 That His name is the highest name, and that at His name every knee will bow.

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,860
 That God has placed everything under Christ's authority for the power and the glory of the

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,860
 church.

53
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,780
 So think about the transformation that has come into your life.

54
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,880
 Because it's true to say that at one point you were spiritually dead.

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,500
 You were dead in your sin.

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,980
 And being dead in your sin, you were separated to God.

57
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,260
 That's what sin does.

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,900
 It separates us from God.

59
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,420
 And God hates sin, but He looks down on us.

60
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,780
 And out of His mercy and His grace, He reached before us.

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,540
 And in the work of Jesus on the cross and the power of the resurrection, Jesus has taken

62
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,260
 the place of sin in us and provided mercy.

63
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,940
 Has taken the place of sin in our lives and now given us grace and forgiveness.

64
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,220
 And everything that He's done is not because we prayed for it.

65
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,740
 It's not because we asked it.

66
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,940
 It's not because we worked really hard to achieve something.

67
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,360
 He's done it all out of the wonder of His grace.

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
 Think about this.

69
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,060
 Your salvation is by grace and grace alone.

70
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,420
 Nothing that you have done has accomplished what Christ has done on the cross.

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,120
 He's done it purely out of His grace for you.

72
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,380
 You are quite literally a poem of God that God has written so that the world can read

73
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,700
 about that grace.

74
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,860
 You are God's workmanship.

75
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,700
 And you've been created in Christ Jesus for these incredible works that He has for you.

76
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
 Think about that.

77
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,540
 You are His work so that you can go and do His work.

78
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:23,380
 That is the beauty of what Christ has done in His death and His resurrection for you.

79
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,940
 Once you were separated from God, but you're no longer separated from Him.

80
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,620
 He's actually brought you near.

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,540
 This is what Jesus' whole ministry and purpose was when He was here.

82
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,420
 It was to reconcile the things that were separated from God, to draw the things that perhaps

83
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,240
 shouldn't have been brought together.

84
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,820
 Now bring them together under the reconciliation of God's forgiveness and love.

85
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,860
 That, my friends, is a picture of what the church is all about.

86
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,100
 I mean, if we're honest with ourselves, many of us in here probably shouldn't be sitting

87
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,780
 in the same room as each other.

88
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,540
 The only way that we can do this is because of the reconciling unity and love that Christ

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,980
 has done on the cross for us.

90
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,060
 I mean, look around this room right now.

91
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,220
 I mean, I love this about the vine, that there are local Chinese here in this room.

92
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,320
 There are overseas Chinese.

93
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,740
 There are Asians from almost every Asian country.

94
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,580
 There are foreigners from all over the world all gathered in this room right now.

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,280
 There are wealthy people.

96
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,480
 There are poor people in this room.

97
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,060
 There are those that have great influence and power and leadership in our city in this

98
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
 room.

99
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,700
 And there are some of you who live a very quiet life here.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,420
 All of us are able to be together because of the reconciling love of Jesus.

101
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,140
 That is the church.

102
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
 Think about it this way.

103
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,100
 We're like an apartment building in Hong Kong, okay?

104
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,180
 We're like an apartment building.

105
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,340
 And our apartment building is rooted deep into the Word of God and the teachings of

106
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,980
 the early church.

107
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,460
 And we'd be constructed with the bamboo and the cements, if you will, of the power of

108
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,020
 the Holy Spirit.

109
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,260
 And our apartment building has one management team that runs it, the Father, the Son, and

110
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,980
 the Holy Spirit.

111
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,220
 And each one of us, we have an apartment in that building.

112
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,860
 And all together, we share in the same utilities and the same power, but we have our own home

113
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,900
 and we have our own lives.

114
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,900
 That is the picture of the church.

115
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,900
 That my friends, is the gospel.

116
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,820
 And this gospel, our city of Hong Kong so desperately needs to hear.

117
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,380
 I have given my life on behalf of this gospel.

118
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,580
 And I don't say that because I'm some perfect person.

119
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,500
 No, I stand here today recognizing the sin that is in my own life, the brokenness that

120
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,800
 I own carry.

121
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,500
 And sometimes that sin tells me that I am not worthy to be doing this.

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,180
 Sometimes I think because of my sin that I shouldn't be a pastor, I shouldn't be doing

123
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,220
 what I do.

124
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,140
 And then I'm reminded that it's not about my abilities, it's not about my effort, it's

125
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,260
 not about what I do, it's about the call of God that is on my life.

126
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,780
 He has called me and He that has called me is faithful.

127
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,580
 And He has also called you.

128
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,620
 He has called you to be wherever it is that He has planted you, to release something of

129
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,380
 His wisdom in the world.

130
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,820
 That's what the church does.

131
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:27,660
 We get to represent, to show the world a manifest expression of the wisdom of God.

132
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,420
 What an honor that is for us as the church to do that.

133
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,700
 And let's face it, sometimes as a church, we're pretty messed up.

134
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
 Sometimes we're pretty broken.

135
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,260
 Our apartment building, if you will, is a little bit run down and in need of renovations.

136
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,580
 We're the kind of apartment building that most people do not want to rent a flat in,

137
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
 okay?

138
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,220
 We're the kind of apartment building that when a typhoon comes, the windows rattle and

139
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,340
 it gets a little bit leaky.

140
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,460
 But guess what?

141
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,220
 God has created the weak things in this world to confound the strong.

142
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,380
 God has made those things that don't on the surface appear like they're gonna have any

143
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,340
 value at all to be the ones that give hope and value into the world.

144
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,420
 That's the church.

145
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,420
 So here is how we pray.

146
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:20,700
 We pray that God would fill us with such strength in our inner being by the power of the Holy

147
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,300
 Spirit.

148
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,620
 And we pray that for you who already have this idea of the grandeur and the wonder of

149
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,540
 love in your life, my prayer is that you would come to see the height and the depth and the

150
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,340
 length and the width of that love like never before.

151
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,340
 And in seeing that kind of love, it would set your heart alight because you would realize

152
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:48,180
 that He is able to do immeasurably more than you could ever ask or imagine so that His

153
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,740
 glory is seen not just through Christ Jesus as beautiful as that is, but also through

154
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,780
 the church for His glory.

155
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:02,980
 Now because of all of that, here is what I plead of you.

156
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,140
 Do not waste your life.

157
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:14,820
 Do not treat God like a hobby, like you might go hiking or running or going to the gym.

158
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,140
 God is not a hobby to be segmented into some moment of your life.

159
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,460
 God is your whole life.

160
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,100
 And because He is your whole life, you are swept up in this wonder and this beauty of

161
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,860
 what it is to live His life in this world.

162
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,360
 And it will look different for every single one of us, but it will hold these things that

163
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,620
 are values in the kingdom, things like grace and humility and love and kindness and goodness.

164
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,580
 And as we hold to these things together, one another, we will find unity amongst us in

165
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:56,220
 a beautiful way because we serve one God, one spirit, one church, one family, one faith,

166
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,220
 one hope.

167
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,980
 And in that unity, God moves powerfully.

168
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,780
 You know what He's actually done in the church?

169
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:12,220
 He's actually raised up apostles and prophets and teachers and pastors and those who are

170
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,460
 able to serve in beautiful ways to help and equip you so that you might become the fullness

171
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,020
 of who you've been created to be.

172
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,700
 God sends these leaders within a local church body to enable you to be prepared for those

173
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,920
 works that He has called you to work in whatever sphere of influence that you have power in

174
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,100
 this city.

175
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,860
 He wants you to be His hands and feet in a beautiful way.

176
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,860
 And guess what?

177
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,100
 When you work that way, and when those apostles and those prophets and those pastors and those

178
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,060
 teachers and those leaders, evangelists, they also work that way, the whole church is built

179
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,020
 up into this maturity, this maturity in Christ Jesus and in the knowledge of Him so that

180
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,300
 we would come to the fullness of the fullness of Christ.

181
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
 What a picture.

182
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,260
 I wonder if you could imagine that.

183
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,260
 The fullness of the fullness of Christ.

184
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:10,460
 And when that happens, no longer are we susceptible to being swayed back and forth by every whim

185
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,580
 of teaching, by whatever is trendy and cool.

186
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:20,220
 No, instead, we're rooted in the reality that Jesus is our head.

187
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,720
 Think of it here in Hong Kong.

188
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,740
 Think of it like a lion dance, okay?

189
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
 God is our head.

190
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,580
 Jesus, our head.

191
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,380
 We're the ones who get to be in the tail.

192
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,380
 We're the ones that get to run alongside of Him.

193
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,900
 We're the ones that actually are in the dance.

194
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,540
 We get to make the dance beautiful.

195
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,860
 So let me challenge you, put your dancing shoes on.

196
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,220
 You're in the dance.

197
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,300
 You're not a bystander.

198
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,820
 You're not a tourist with some camera and some fleeting memories.

199
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,940
 No, you're actually a local in the house of God.

200
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,440
 You're a part of the team.

201
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,700
 You're on the dance team.

202
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,300
 Put your dance shoes on and get yourself excited.

203
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,660
 Put on the new self that Christ has paid the price for.

204
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,260
 Put on the new attitudes that Christ has given you.

205
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,580
 It's like literally putting on new clothes that you can show the world.

206
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,660
 Now if you're going to put on some new clothes, that probably means that you might have to

207
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,540
 take off some old clothes.

208
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,940
 Clothes like anger and deceit and lying.

209
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,820
 You should wear clothes that represent what is truly actually in your heart.

210
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,100
 And so often we don't do that.

211
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,620
 We think we can wear clothes of humility and truth and falsehood and pride at the same

212
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
 time.

213
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,460
 If you try that, you will look pretty stupid.

214
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,860
 My suggestion to you is to ensure that everything that comes out of your mouth actually represents

215
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,020
 what you believe in your heart.

216
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,600
 Those of you who have been stealing before, you shouldn't steal anymore.

217
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,380
 Those of you who have lied before, you should stop lying.

218
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,140
 You should correlate the words of your mouth to the beauty that is within you.

219
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,740
 This is the simplest way I could say it.

220
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,900
 Imitate God.

221
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,560
 How do you imitate God?

222
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,980
 You receive the fullness of His love and then you show the world that love.

223
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,860
 How has Christ shown His love to you?

224
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,620
 He has sent Himself to the cross to die for you.

225
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,740
 The question then you should ask yourself is this, what act of self-sacrificial love

226
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,040
 could I show somebody today?

227
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,420
 Do that and you imitate God.

228
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,800
 But if you're anything like me, you can end up imitating other things.

229
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,040
 I imitate things like anger at times, bitterness.

230
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,760
 I imitate at times lust, things that I struggle with.

231
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
 And maybe there are some things that you also imitate.

232
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,660
 The reality is we can so end up imitating Satan rather than God and that has no place

233
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,100
 in the kingdom.

234
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,960
 Instead, you are children of light.

235
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,720
 So live in the light.

236
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,020
 Shine your light brightly in the city of Hong Kong so people would know the gospel that

237
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,820
 sets them free.

238
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,660
 And if you see any darkness around you, you should know that you're bringing the light

239
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
 of Christ into that place of darkness.

240
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,820
 If you see any injustice around you, you should know that you're living as a child of light

241
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,220
 to show gospel and truth and hope and justice in the very places where we see the greatest

242
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,300
 brokenness.

243
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,980
 That's what it is to be the people of light.

244
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,460
 And Christ has called us to do that.

245
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,340
 So if you want to act wisely, live in the light.

246
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,660
 If you want to live in the light, well then you should imitate God.

247
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,260
 And if you want to imitate God, you should love like God loves.

248
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,340
 You should probably write that down somewhere.

249
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:53,100
 If you want to act and live wisely, you should live in the light.

250
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,580
 If you want to live in the light, you should imitate God.

251
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,740
 And if you imitate God, that is to love like God loves.

252
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:09,300
 Do that and this world truly changes.

253
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,540
 What I want you to do every single morning when you wake up is I want you to think about

254
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,660
 this in your relationships because it is living as children of light in the areas of our relationships

255
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,020
 that gets transformed the most.

256
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,700
 I mean you should be speaking words of love and encouragement over one another.

257
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,580
 You should even be singing spiritual songs over one another as strange as that might

258
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,500
 sound.

259
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,060
 Think about the relationships in your lives.

260
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,200
 If you're a wife here, you should be thinking about how do you best support and grow and

261
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,940
 flourish your family.

262
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,300
 How do you support your husband and lift him up?

263
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,700
 If you're a husband here, you should be thinking about how you can love your wife like Christ

264
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,420
 loved the church and gave himself up for the church.

265
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,060
 You should be thinking about what it is to love your wife like you would love your own

266
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,380
 body, caring for her like you would care for yourself, putting her first.

267
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,340
 If you're a child here, you need to honor and be obedient to your parents.

268
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:14,380
 If you're a domestic worker here, you ought to work with an open and loving heart.

269
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,620
 If you're an employer here or somebody in leadership or government here, then you should

270
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,900
 govern with humility and dignity and love.

271
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:29,100
 When we treat one another like this, we actually show the world something of what Christ has

272
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,420
 done in his death and his resurrection.

273
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:39,420
 So every morning when you wake up, do this spiritual checklist and do this in order to

274
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,740
 protect yourself from the work of the enemy in your life.

275
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,540
 Here's the first thing you should do.

276
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,140
 Get truth into you like a daily breakfast.

277
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,980
 Eat up God's Word first thing in the morning.

278
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,660
 Before you jump online, get on email, do Twitter or anything like that, Instagram, get the

279
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,780
 Bible open, read his Word, listen to it, put it in your heart.

280
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,380
 His Word first, the truth, like a daily breakfast.

281
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
 Here's the second thing.

282
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,020
 You should put on your new identity and wear it proudly.

283
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,540
 Maybe like a comfortable t-shirt that you love, your favorite t-shirt, putting on that

284
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,100
 t-shirt to show the world who you are.

285
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,460
 That's the new identity Christ has given you, and you should live that out in the world

286
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,460
 proudly.

287
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,940
 You should think every day thirdly about what it is to walk in peace.

288
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,420
 Think about the most comfortable shoes that you have and what it feels like to walk in

289
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,060
 those comfortable shoes.

290
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,780
 That's how you should feel every second of the day.

291
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,580
 And then have faith that God will protect you.

292
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,860
 Faith is like your skin, protecting and covering up your organs so they're resisting from decay.

293
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,900
 That's what faith will do in your life.

294
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,320
 It'll enable you to know that God is with you no matter what it is that you are facing.

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,180
 And then think about this.

296
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,260
 I want you to know that God is with you above everything else.

297
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,780
 That's like your mobile phone.

298
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,740
 Your mobile phone is always with you.

299
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,820
 Some of you, it's glued to your hand.

300
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:14,260
 Think about God's presence in your life like a mobile phone, always with you.

301
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,740
 And I want you to pray.

302
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,820
 I want you to pray in every occasion with every kind of prayer.

303
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,100
 And here's the beautiful thing.

304
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,540
 When you pray for one another, you will be astounded at the healing you will receive.

305
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,500
 And if I had one final request, it would be this.

306
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,660
 I would love it if you would pray for me.

307
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,580
 Pray that I would declare the gospel of Jesus Christ in Hong Kong fearlessly as God has

308
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,440
 called me to do it.

309
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,420
 I pray that you would live in grace and peace.

310
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,500
 And as you live in grace and peace, you will find the glory of the Lord around you and

311
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,860
 you will find yourself safe and comfortable and alive like never before.

312
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:01,900
 And I pray this in Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.

313
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,780
 Well in case you didn't realize, that's the whole book of Ephesians from start to finish.

314
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,660
 Yeah.

315
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,180
 So I wanted to...

316
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,460
 We're starting a whole study, a whole sermon series, 15 weeks on the book of Ephesians.

317
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,340
 But before we jump into studying it passage by passage, I actually wanted to bring it

318
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,300
 to you today just like Paul originally intended it to.

319
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,780
 Because when he wrote this letter to the church in Ephesus, a small church meeting in some

320
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,540
 houses in the city of Ephesus, a church under great persecution, a church that was struggling

321
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,940
 to understand its identity, Paul writes them a letter not to be dissected and studied and

322
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,100
 all of this kind of stuff.

323
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,860
 He writes them basically a conversation that he's trying to have with them to help them

324
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:54,620
 to understand who they are in Christ Jesus, what Christ has done, and then in that to

325
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,760
 live in a way that would honor and glorify Christ in the world.

326
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,020
 That's why he wrote the book of Ephesians.

327
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,860
 And I think so often as Christians, we open the book and we go to our favorite section

328
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,100
 and we read that little bit, but actually the whole letter was designed to be read in

329
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,580
 one sitting.

330
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,060
 It was designed to be heard just like you just heard it.

331
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,060
 And of course I changed it and paraphrased it to make it like Hong Kong because I think

332
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,500
 that's what Paul would want me to do.

333
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,220
 Because he wrote the letter to people in Ephesus for specific issues that were going on in

334
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
 Ephesus.

335
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,380
 I translated it for us in Hong Kong for the specific issues that we're seeing, but wasn't

336
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:37,580
 it glorious just to sit under the beautiful Word of God.

337
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:44,220
 This idea that there is so much that Christ is doing in our lives, so much that he's done

338
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,540
 that we have not earned.

339
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,820
 And when we understand the beauty of that, we're then able to walk out as his representatives

340
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,860
 in the world around us.

341
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,300
 That's what Ephesians is all about.

342
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,900
 And in the first two verses of the letter, just the first two verses, Paul actually introduces

343
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,620
 the two main pivot points of the whole book.

344
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,900
 So I'm actually now going to read you the actual book of Ephesians.

345
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,060
 I'm not going to read the whole thing.

346
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,620
 You'll be glad to hear it because I just told you the whole thing.

347
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620
 So let me read you just the first two verses.

348
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,620
 Is that okay?

349
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
 All right.

350
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,740
 Some of you were like, "What is Andrew doing today?

351
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,900
 Did he have a weird curry last night?"

352
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,460
 You were thinking like, "This is not like he normally does it."

353
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,140
 Anybody felt that way?

354
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,660
 Did I turn you off?

355
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
 Hopefully you stuck with me.

356
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
 Is that okay?

357
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
 All right.

358
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,620
 Ephesians 1, first two verses, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,

359
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:43,380
 to the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus, grace and peace to you from

360
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,220
 God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

361
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,420
 I love how Paul begins.

362
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,020
 He says, "Grace and peace to you."

363
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,400
 This was not just a standard greeting in those days.

364
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,500
 This was actually something that Paul formulated and used in almost all of his writings, in

365
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,100
 almost all of the letters that he wrote to the church, he would often start with this

366
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,380
 idea of grace and peace.

367
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,300
 And here in the book of Ephesians, the whole book is actually structured around these two

368
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,520
 themes of grace and peace.

369
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,780
 This is not Paul just going, "Hey, how are you?

370
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,300
 Good to see you."

371
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:23,100
 This is Paul trying to explain something that is central to the heart of God and something

372
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,580
 that should be central to every church community, not just in Ephesus, but I think for all time,

373
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,420
 grace and peace.

374
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,620
 Let me break these down real quick.

375
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:38,980
 Grace is the Greek word here, charis, which comes from the root word kario.

376
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:45,300
 And that word in the Greek essentially means this, an unmerited favor that causes you to

377
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,980
 celebrate, rejoice, or be glad, unmerited favor.

378
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,860
 In other words, what grace is defined is as a gift, something that you've never earned,

379
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,020
 something you don't deserve, even something that you've never asked for.

380
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:04,380
 It's like a surprise that is given to you out of the blue, and you're just blown away

381
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,380
 that somebody would be so generous.

382
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,660
 That's the idea of grace.

383
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,380
 And what's really important for you to grasp just right at the start of the book of Ephesians

384
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,820
 is that this word grace in the Greek comes in the passive form, which makes sense because

385
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,820
 it is a passive thing.

386
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,400
 Grace is not something you do.

387
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,220
 Grace is something you receive.

388
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,360
 Grace is not something you earn.

389
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,900
 Grace is something you understand.

390
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,540
 And as you receive and you understand it, it is something that comes into you, which

391
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:42,060
 causes you to do nothing other than to rejoice and be glad.

392
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
 That's grace.

393
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,860
 And that's why Paul spends all that time in this letter saying you need to understand

394
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,740
 that your salvation is not because you did something.

395
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,520
 Your salvation is a gift of grace from God to you, unmerited, because He loves you, and

396
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,520
 that should cause you to celebrate, to worship, and to praise Him.

397
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,860
 Grace is a surprise of the generosity of God.

398
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,440
 Peace is different.

399
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,400
 Peace actually has two words that are associated to it.

400
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
 In the Greek, it's this eriane.

401
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,800
 In the Hebrew, though, which is what it draws from, is the word shalom.

402
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,600
 When we think of peace in the modern context, we think peace is the absence of something,

403
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
 usually the absence of conflict.

404
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,480
 So we might say, "Oh, that home is very peaceful."

405
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,960
 What we're meaning is they're not throwing things at each other in that house, right?

406
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,540
 Or we might pray for peace in the Middle East, and what we mean is that war would cease there.

407
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,000
 But in the Hebrew thinking, peace is not about the absence of something.

408
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,600
 It's actually about the presence of something.

409
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,000
 And it's actually about working towards the presence of something, the presence of wholeness,

410
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,760
 of completeness, of fullness, of how something ought to be, the presence of safety, of security.

411
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,760
 Another word associated to it means shalom, which is reconciliation.

412
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,720
 There's another word, shalomat, that represents perfection.

413
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,120
 These ideas of wholeness, reconciliation, the way things ought to be, things flourishing

414
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,640
 and being just as God created them to, the presence of that is peace.

415
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,560
 So interestingly, grace is this idea of passivity, "I receive," but peace in the Greek and in

416
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,580
 the Hebrew is an active word.

417
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,200
 It's about a doing, it's about a being, and a way we are.

418
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,040
 We act in peace.

419
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,600
 So we pick up the phone and we call that person that we haven't spoken to for ages because

420
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,120
 we had an argument we never reconciled, and we get on the phone and we try to reconcile

421
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
 it.

422
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
 That's an act of peace.

423
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,800
 Or we send that email that we've been meaning to send because we saw somebody was mistreated

424
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,280
 by this company and we want to point that out and stand in the gap for someone who was

425
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,720
 mistreated.

426
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,000
 That is a work, an act of peace.

427
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,160
 Peace has action and movement towards it.

428
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,100
 And I love the way that Paul begins his letter.

429
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,640
 He says, "Here's the whole point of this.

430
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,960
 There is grace and there is peace."

431
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,080
 In other words, there is something for you to receive and there is something for you

432
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,240
 to do.

433
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,680
 There is something for you to understand in revelation, and as you understand what God

434
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,940
 has done in revelation for you, you then want to live a certain way in the world.

435
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,200
 There is grace and there is peace.

436
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,800
 Does that make sense to you?

437
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,640
 Does that make sense to you?

438
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,480
 Whoo, good, you're still there.

439
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,480
 So grace and peace is how Paul actually breaks down the whole of the letter of Ephesians.

440
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
 Let me show this to you.

441
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,160
 The first three chapters are all the focus on what Christ has done.

442
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,480
 So in there he talks about how all things are under Christ.

443
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,280
 We've been adopted into his family.

444
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
 Sin is being dealt with.

445
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,640
 We've been given a new self.

446
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,120
 We can know God now.

447
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,560
 We have a gift of salvation.

448
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,100
 We are his workmanship.

449
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,240
 We have this unity together.

450
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,080
 You probably heard me talk about that sort of stuff in the opening of this message.

451
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,400
 That's the first three chapters of Ephesians.

452
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,460
 That stuff that you are to receive, not stuff for you to do.

453
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,040
 But then in chapters four to six, he then speaks on this idea of peace.

454
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,440
 So because of all the grace on the left side, live a life worthy of this grace.

455
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
 Build one another up.

456
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,700
 Strive for maturity in Christ.

457
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,040
 Live as light of Christ in the world.

458
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,400
 Imitate Christ in everything.

459
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,600
 Build healthy marriages and families.

460
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,360
 Protect yourself from temptation.

461
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,240
 Live in the power of the Spirit.

462
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,880
 He's like, you've got grace, all this stuff Christ has done for you, now in peace, live

463
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,640
 this way.

464
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,840
 You should be inspired, he's saying to his church.

465
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,080
 Once you understand what Christ has done, how can you not then?

466
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,240
 I said this in my little opening bit.

467
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,520
 I said, here's what I plead with you.

468
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,920
 Don't waste your life.

469
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,680
 There's too many Christians that die in old age with a belief in Jesus who wasted their

470
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,860
 life.

471
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,320
 You haven't been saved just so that you can get to heaven.

472
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,560
 Ephesians is about being saved so you can live the new humanity in the world today so

473
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,040
 that others might see the light and be drawn to it.

474
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,640
 Ephesians is ascending gospel.

475
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,720
 Ephesians is about receiving and giving.

476
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,720
 And if there's one thing that we have as a leadership here at the Vine for you over the

477
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,200
 next 15 weeks, as we break down every little segment of this book, you're going to be so

478
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,060
 full of Ephesians by the end of it, trust me.

479
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:44,140
 As we go through it, my prayer for you right at the start is grace and peace.

480
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:50,460
 It was designed so that you would hear the whole thing in one go and see the wonder that

481
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,280
 there is in a God who has done all of this stuff and now calls us to live in a radical

482
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,080
 new way.

483
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,060
 So as I began, let me finish.

484
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:09,560
 This is from me, a disciple of Christ Jesus by the call of God to you, my family and friends

485
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,160
 who call the Vine their home church in Hong Kong, who are faithful and trying to live

486
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,100
 a faithful life.

487
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:23,100
 Grace and peace to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now and forever.

488
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,960
 And everyone says, "Amen."

489
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
 Let's pray.

490
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:35,960
 Father, I'm so humbled by the swept beauty of your Word, the grandeur of it.

491
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,020
 We thank you that Paul wrote a letter to a church that wasn't supposed to be just dissected

492
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:48,240
 line by line, but he created a letter that was to be read in the church in one sitting

493
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,400
 so that people could hear the glory of the gospel of Jesus.

494
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,620
 Lord, my prayer is that that is something that may have happened for some of us in this

495
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:03,560
 room here today, that as we hear the whole of the story in one, we would be people called

496
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,200
 to grace and peace.

497
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,200
 Father, I know that in this room there are some people in the season ahead of these next

498
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,180
 15 weeks who are going to need the grace.

499
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,200
 Maybe some of you in this room, you are new to the faith.

500
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,320
 Maybe you came to faith last week at Easter or maybe recently through an Alpha we've done

501
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,480
 or in other ways.

502
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,200
 And you're wondering, "What is it that Christ has really done for me?"

503
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,300
 My prayer for you over the next 15 weeks is that you would come into this beautiful understanding

504
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,760
 of the grace of God in your life, that you would truly know what He's done.

505
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,040
 And if you've been a Christian for many, many years, if you're anything like me, it's easy

506
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,080
 to settle into the habit of being a Christian and lose something of the wonder of what it

507
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,960
 is to be a Christian.

508
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,800
 So my prayer is if you've been a Christian for a long time, that as we open up Ephesians

509
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,200
 together you would also be blown away once again by His grace.

510
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,800
 His grace to you, not because you deserve it, but because He loves you.

511
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,080
 And Lord, I know that there'll be people in this room where peace is the season you're

512
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,140
 moving them into as we do this series together.

513
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,720
 That you're going to be calling them to pick up the phone, to write that email, to have

514
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:22,320
 a coffee, to actually stretch out and try to reconcile a broken relationship, or perhaps

515
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,840
 to stand in the gap where they see an injustice.

516
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,680
 There'll be some people in this room, Lord, that peace is going to be the season you're

517
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,240
 moving into, and they have a voice and an authority and an influence, and you want them

518
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,560
 now to use it in a new way.

519
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:44,080
 So Lord, for those in this room where peace, the bringing forth of the flourishing of Christ

520
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,200
 in this world, Lord, if that's their season, I pray you would empower them in the Holy

521
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,600
 Spirit to live that way boldly, Lord.

522
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,240
 Whether it's grace or peace, all of it we submit ourselves under the authority of Christ

523
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,440
 Jesus, and we look forward, Lord, to being that apartment building we spoke about, the

524
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:14,840
 lion dance that we talked about, being in the game, living life that matters.

525
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,640
 I pray you would release this over the vine in these weeks, and we thank you for this.

526
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,800
 In Jesus' name, everyone says, amen, amen.

527
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,440
 Would you stand with me, and we're going to respond together as a church in words.
