1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 This beautiful thing that we're doing here is we're singing this song about that your

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,120
 love is greater than anything I've ever tasted.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,800
 Just earlier in the service, I saw a picture of somebody who had walked a long way to get

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
 to a restaurant.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,320
 And they get to this restaurant and they sit down and they open the food menu on the table

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,640
 and they're really, really hungry.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,040
 And they're so desiring to eat.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,440
 And they open up this food menu and it's blank from start to finish.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,440
 There's nothing on the menu at all.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
 And I felt like that was speaking to some of us in this room where you've got this real

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
 hunger and this desire for maybe an answer from God.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,280
 Maybe you've been praying for a while about something.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,120
 Or maybe there's a circumstance or situation that you're dealing with in your life and

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
 you're looking for direction.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
 You want an answer.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,120
 You want to know what is the Holy Spirit calling you to do in that particular thing.

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,280
 And it feels like you're not getting any answer.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,120
 It feels like there's a hunger in you for the next step, a hunger in you for the achievement

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,720
 of something maybe, for a dream, for a breakthrough in a relationship.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,600
 But when you open the menu, it's just blank.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
 There's nothing there at all.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
 And there's a frustration in you.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,280
 And then I saw in this picture, the waiter approached the table and the waiter says,

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
 "Would you like the wine menu?"

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,440
 And the person sitting there goes, "Sure."

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,320
 And the waiter gives the wine menu and he opens the wine menu and it's bottle after

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,160
 bottle after bottle of the best vintage wine that could ever be drunk.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,800
 And I felt like the Holy Spirit was saying that for some of us in this room, like, we

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,600
 have this hunger for an answer and we're looking for the answer in a certain place.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,840
 And yet actually the answer is a love that is greater than anything we've ever tasted.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,760
 That maybe the thing that you're searching for in that menu, it's blank because that

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,680
 thing's never actually going to satisfy.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,480
 It's never actually going to achieve the thing that you really want.

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,720
 And the Holy Spirit's handing you a menu that He's written.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
 It's like the wine menu.

36
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,600
 The New Testament talks about the new wine of Christ.

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,080
 This new wine that has been poured out into new wineskin.

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,640
 That we can receive a refreshment from Him.

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,280
 Jesus does His first miracle at a wedding when the wine's run out.

40
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,280
 And He takes those six ceremonial jars and He fills them with water and He, when the

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,840
 master of the banquet tasted it, He said, "This is the best wine I've ever had.

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,200
 You saved the best for last."

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,040
 And I feel like Jesus is saying to some of us today, like, you've tried every other option,

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 but guess what?

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
 The best thing is right here at the end.

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
 I'm going to give you the best thing.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,560
 Some of you need to stop searching for what doesn't satisfy.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,240
 Just open your heart to the new wine of the Holy Spirit.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
 That will always satisfy.

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
 You'll never run dry.

51
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,360
 If that's for you today, I want to pray over us.

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,160
 Before we do anything else in this service, I want to speak that new wine of Jesus into

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 you.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,960
 If there's a question you're looking for, an answer you're desiring, there's some frustration

55
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
 there for you.

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,320
 I want to pray for you.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,840
 If that's you, just open your hands where you are.

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,280
 We're all got our eyes closed.

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,920
 We're just doing this privately between us and God, but it's a way of saying, yeah, if

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,400
 you're watching online right now and this is speaking to you too, just open your hands

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
 wherever you are.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,960
 And I want to pray, Lord, right now, here at the vine, both in this room and those that

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,200
 are watching online.

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,800
 Father, we pray that we are desiring this new wine.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 We've looked in the menu for long enough, staring at blank pages.

66
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,600
 We've looked for satisfaction in other things that are ultimately not Christ.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,280
 We've desired to find answers within ourselves or within others.

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,800
 But Lord, it is you and only you that can satisfy.

69
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,680
 You are this new wine that has been poured out in the new covenants.

70
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,860
 And Lord, I want to pray for each person here, whether that's relevant or important for them

71
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,240
 this morning, that your new wine would come by the power of your Holy Spirit right now.

72
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,000
 That you would fill and anoint and appoint, Lord.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,880
 That we would be like that firefly that Susanna saw in the darkness around us, holding out

74
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,600
 a light that is holding forth and holding fast to the gospel, Lord.

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,320
 Lord, we pray that you would pour out your wine on your dry and your weary people.

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,120
 It would be like an Ezekiel 39 moment, Lord, where the dry bones are brought together and

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,120
 your breath comes upon them and brings them to life.

78
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,920
 I pray that the wine of Jesus, the wine that never runs dry, the cup that always runs

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,680
 over would be upon you and through you and in you for his glory.

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,040
 And we pray this in Jesus' name, everyone says, amen.

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
 Amen.

82
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
 Awesome.

83
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,520
 Can we thank our worship team?

84
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,640
 Just amazing as always.

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,240
 So blessed by our worship.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,800
 Have a seat, have a seat.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 My name is Andrew.

88
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 I'm one of the drummers here at the Vine.

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,320
 It's great to be with you.

90
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,960
 I know if you're new, I'm relatively new, I'm Andrew, one of the pastors.

91
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,680
 And it's really nice to have you here.

92
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
 Welcome online.

93
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,960
 If you're tuning in with us, if you're just joining us, it's great to have you too with

94
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
 us.

95
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,160
 We're considering our series From the Heart today where we're really moving off the back

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,400
 of a sermon series through April and May into June called A Different Spirit.

97
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,040
 If you've been at the Vine for some time, for a season, you know we were doing that

98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,600
 series on Numbers 13 and 14, looking at the spies that went into the promised land, asking

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,360
 the question, maybe it's a Caleb spirit that we need in this season and in this hour in

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,520
 Hong Kong with all the changes that we're facing, July 1 coming up this coming week,

101
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,440
 the one-year anniversary of really a significant change in our city.

102
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,800
 And we're all still wondering how do we live now and navigate now as Christians within

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 this new context.

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,400
 And we've been saying that maybe there's this different spirit for us to carry in this new

105
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
 season.

106
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
 And the From the Heart series is really a chance for us to hear from some of our leaders

107
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,120
 that have been here at the Vine over many, many years, some of the founding pastors,

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,280
 some of the current leaders, and ask them a simple question.

109
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,720
 What's on your heart for the Vine?

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,800
 What's on your heart for us as Christians in Hong Kong in this hour?

111
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,400
 How we might begin to live out this different spirit that we feel the Holy Spirit is calling

112
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 us to.

113
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,600
 And today I couldn't be more excited to invite up someone who's been a long-term mentor to

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,400
 me, a friend, a father in the spirit.

115
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,760
 Would you put your hands together as we welcome Tony Reid.

116
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
 Let's put our hands.

117
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
 Welcome, Tony.

118
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
 Have a seat, my friend.

119
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
 Welcome to my living room.

120
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
 Thank you.

121
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
 We have 400 people.

122
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
 Music background as well.

123
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,760
 Yeah, yeah.

124
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
 Do you like my drumming?

125
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
 That's good, isn't it?

126
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
 Very good.

127
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:37,440
 Anyway, it is a real privilege to have you with us today, Tony.

128
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,920
 We don't say that lightly.

129
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,960
 You've been a part of this church for 25-something years.

130
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,440
 It doesn't show, don't worry.

131
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 But we are so grateful.

132
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,520
 And I recognize that there's probably a bunch of people maybe in this room, and particularly

133
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,140
 maybe those online as well, that don't know you as well.

134
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,400
 Maybe they're relatively new to the Vine in the last year or two.

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,000
 Maybe you could just tell us a bit, first of all, who you are, how you came to Hong

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,320
 Kong, your journey with this church.

137
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
 Thank you, Andrew.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,720
 It's a great privilege to be able to be with you and to just speak to you today.

139
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,160
 Well, I arrived in Hong Kong in 1986 with my wife and three children.

140
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,800
 We've since adopted a young Chinese girl, so we have four children.

141
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,340
 But I came not as a pastor, I came as an engineer.

142
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,360
 And that has always been my training to earn my living.

143
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,980
 But all my life, I have been involved in the church.

144
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,480
 The church has been on my heart.

145
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,600
 I've done many, many jobs in different churches.

146
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,640
 So as I came to Hong Kong, what was on my heart was thinking about why was God bringing

147
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,720
 me here?

148
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 What was that purpose?

149
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
 How could I serve in the church in some way?

150
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,040
 And so as we began looking around churches, we eventually ended up in Repulse Bay Baptist

151
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 Church.

152
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,560
 I think you might be familiar with it.

153
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
 I was there.

154
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
 I was like 14.

155
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
 14, yeah.

156
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
 A while ago.

157
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,440
 I don't think I was your Sunday school teacher, but never mind.

158
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,640
 No, you weren't.

159
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,800
 And that church, of course, then evolved by a number of stages into the Vine Christian

160
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,160
 Fellowship and then the Vine Church itself.

161
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,640
 And that church had a certain character to it which attracted a number of people.

162
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:37,800
 And it grew and it was run by a group of about four or five elders who ran the church as

163
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,720
 a sort of lay ministry, all doing different jobs.

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,400
 And as the church grew, it became apparent that we really needed someone to be able to

165
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,240
 look after and to minister to the church, to be the pastor of the church.

166
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
 And so we advertised.

167
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,560
 And at the same time as that was going around, both John Snellgrove and myself really felt

168
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,880
 God speaking to us.

169
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,120
 And I felt speaking to my heart quite late in life that actually, Tony, yeah, perhaps

170
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,720
 you should be a bit brave and step up and maybe this is a role that you should take.

171
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,880
 And so we both put our names forward to the elders and said we both feel that God's calling

172
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
 us.

173
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
 What a choice.

174
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
 And so to their great credit, they appointed both of us.

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,240
 And I must say, I treasure the faith which those pastors put in both of us at that time.

176
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,240
 And yeah, as the church has grown and as we've seen all that's been happening in the Vine

177
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:44,680
 and just sensing that God had asked us to grow a next generation church, the realization

178
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,520
 of course dawned that we were not next generation pastors.

179
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,600
 So we better start looking for one.

180
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,240
 And very fortunately, there was this young man in the congregation who was a brilliant

181
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,560
 speaker and able to really express the heart of the Vine being with it from the beginning.

182
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,800
 And so it was our great privilege to be able to hand over that leadership to Andrew.

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,960
 And at the same time for us, a huge privilege to be able to still serve in the church.

184
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,480
 And so that's my story.

185
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,680
 You know, can we put our hands together just to honor this man?

186
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,040
 I just think it's amazing.

187
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,920
 There's not a lot of churches that would allow two people to be senior pastor at the same

188
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
 time.

189
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,000
 There's not a lot of people that would be able to be a senior pastor alongside of another

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,680
 equal senior pastor at the same time.

191
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,520
 And there's not a lot of people that would stick around at the church after they've handed

192
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,320
 it over and continue to cheer it on and to believe for its best.

193
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,400
 You know, the Vine is incredibly blessed with Tony and John Snellgrove.

194
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,920
 You're going to hear from John in a couple of weeks in this series.

195
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,880
 I think it's an amazing thing that we should never take for granted that God has done.

196
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,660
 It's passing through into the next generation.

197
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,880
 And I admire you guys.

198
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,080
 All right, I'm going to stop loving on you, baby.

199
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,960
 It's going to be a love fest for like 30 minutes, so we'll stop that.

200
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,320
 You and I have been talking quite a bit about this different spirit series.

201
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,360
 And you know, the role that Tony plays at the Vine is our justice advocate.

202
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,840
 So Tony has a role here to help keep me and the other pastors and the church up to kind

203
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,640
 of date with all the stuff that's happening in terms of justice, social justice, God's

204
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,400
 heart for justice, the social political context of Hong Kong in the city, and much of what

205
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,200
 you perhaps have heard during a different spirit series coming from my mouth has really

206
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,080
 been birthed out of conversations that Tony and I have had around what we're sensing the

207
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 Holy Spirit is saying about Hong Kong and the social political context.

208
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,280
 And so that series was quite personal for both of us.

209
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,640
 And I know you wanted to share a few things.

210
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,200
 Yeah, I think it was.

211
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,920
 I think it's been really very significant for the church.

212
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,960
 You know, to me, this is not just been another series, another series, although, of course,

213
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,560
 all of these things are important for us.

214
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,320
 But I feel this is another chapter for the church.

215
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
 And I feel it's not only been significant for us.

216
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,160
 I think it's a significant word for the whole of the Church of Hong Kong, because it's allowed

217
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,600
 people to be able to reflect, not just to accept things that are happening around in

218
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,320
 a passive way, but to be able to, as you know, as Andrew has shown us how to live our lives

219
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,880
 with that different spirit.

220
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,600
 And so I think it's opened up for us a lot of possibilities, you know, thinking about

221
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,520
 the social and political circumstances that surround us and just appreciating and understanding

222
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,560
 what that means.

223
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,440
 Considering that in that context, what the gospel means for us today in those circumstances.

224
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,280
 And then lastly, I think, trying to work out what sort of community that we need to be

225
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
 in response to that.

226
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,600
 And I guess it's partly that that I want to talk about today.

227
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,480
 Well, so Tony and I have talked a lot about the gospel, and you might have heard in the

228
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,040
 different spirit series me talk a lot about the gospel and how this is a significant inflection

229
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 point for the gospel.

230
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,480
 And one of the things that I think has really resonated for us as we've conversed is the

231
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,920
 idea of, well, what is the gospel?

232
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,320
 And perhaps we don't embrace or grasp the beauty and the power of the gospel as much

233
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,720
 as it was originally intended to be seen and grasped.

234
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,960
 So I know you want to share a few things around that.

235
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,800
 So tell us, what is it for you that's really buzzing about the gospel at this time?

236
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,720
 Yeah, well, I think the important thing is that because of these circumstances, we're

237
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,400
 forced to sort of re-evaluate the value, the importance, the centrality of the gospel to

238
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,200
 everything that we're doing.

239
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,040
 Because if we're going to live in this different spirit, then we've got to be able to have

240
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,680
 some solid ground, we've got to have some solid things in which we are basing our lives

241
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,640
 and living our lives as well.

242
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,440
 And of course, we're called to be disciples of Jesus.

243
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:15,280
 And so I think there is a challenge to us in this, a challenge to me to look again,

244
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,680
 to see what it was that Jesus was saying and how he was living, and how this affects the

245
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,200
 global church as well.

246
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,960
 And so I want to start by focusing on two imperatives that I think are important as

247
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,960
 foundations of how we view what our perspective of the gospel is about.

248
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,480
 And the first one really is understanding and appreciating the initiative of God to

249
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,120
 save the world from destruction.

250
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,080
 You know, put yourself in the place of God when he created the world, you know, and all

251
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:57,520
 this process, all of his love, hard work and creative process goes into creating this amazing

252
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,400
 place, this cosmos, this planet.

253
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,360
 And then thinking about all the possibilities of what that might mean in terms of the glory

254
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,000
 of this place.

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,080
 But then afterwards, when seeing things going downhill, seeing the sin, seeing all the destruction,

256
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,520
 seeing idolatry, seeing all the desperate things that were happening in the world, imagine

257
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,240
 what his heart must have been thinking about.

258
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,720
 And he must have thought, either I'm going to get rid of this and we'll start again.

259
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 Let's do something different.

260
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,360
 Let's do something new.

261
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,800
 But God didn't do that.

262
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,480
 God was so intent.

263
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:44,360
 It was his imperative to save the world, to redeem it, to make out of the mess that we

264
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,240
 have made it something that would bring him glory.

265
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,480
 And of course, the key verses that we read in scripture that tell us about God's heart

266
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,920
 for this are really in John chapter 3, in the most well-known verses in the Bible.

267
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
 John chapter 3, verse 16.

268
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,960
 Let me read them to you again.

269
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:12,280
 It says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever

270
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,320
 believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

271
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:23,200
 For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world

272
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,040
 through him.

273
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,680
 Whoever believes through him, or in him, is not condemned, but whoever does not believe

274
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,080
 stands condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only

275
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,360
 son."

276
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,840
 And of course, normally when we read these verses, we think about the love of God, you

277
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,760
 know, in sending Jesus, but there's that little word "gave" that God gave his son.

278
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,800
 And in this giving, I think we get a sort of little picture into God's heart, a little

279
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:08,720
 sense of what God was doing here, that there is a sense of almost of desperation.

280
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,760
 You see, I don't think we see the risk.

281
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,640
 I don't think we see the commitment of God.

282
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,160
 I don't think we see the danger that was involved in what God was doing here in sending his

283
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,720
 son.

284
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:32,120
 I don't think we see the sort of drastic action that was required.

285
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:40,360
 And there is within this, I think, a reflection of God's, the necessity that he felt to save

286
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
 the world.

287
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
 That was imperative.

288
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,880
 That was his heart, and that he will go to any extent in order to redeem and save this

289
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,960
 world.

290
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,800
 And we also have to see the way God does this now.

291
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,480
 You know, he's not now condemning the world.

292
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,080
 He's not now thinking about destruction, but now we see a different face of God.

293
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,920
 We see the love of God.

294
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,440
 We see the embracing, the open arms of God, just like in that parable, that story of the

295
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,380
 lost son.

296
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:24,600
 We see the sacrifice and the love of God welcoming, embracing us, wanting us to have that relationship

297
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,760
 with him that would save us.

298
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,240
 I think what's really important for us to reflect on here is the reality of this dangerous

299
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,160
 gospel that in God giving, you know, we've made John 3, 16 such a bumper sticker, right?

300
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,640
 Like it's on the fridge magnet thing, and we kind of know that verse so well, and yet

301
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,400
 it actually contains this beautiful risk that you're talking about, this danger to it.

302
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,440
 And that risk really comes out in that second half of the verse, which I think is the second

303
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,280
 imperative you wanted to talk about, yeah?

304
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,040
 Yeah, it does certainly, because of course, you know, John 3, 16 goes on to John 3, 17,

305
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,680
 which says, "God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world."

306
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:11,120
 And so it's important for us to see Jesus' mission, not as a condemner, not as a judge,

307
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,160
 but Jesus was inviting us the opportunity to have this new relationship with him and

308
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,440
 with God.

309
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,520
 But there is a choice to be made.

310
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,080
 And this choice is significant.

311
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,600
 Whoever does not believe is self-condemned.

312
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:39,200
 And so we see the imperative of God, the urgency of God to save the world.

313
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,600
 There's a possibility that there may be an outcome that God does not want to see from

314
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
 him.

315
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,440
 And I think we see a great tension here.

316
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:55,880
 There is a tension between the immensity and the initiative and love of God on one hand,

317
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,760
 and on the uncertainty of the response on the other.

318
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:07,240
 And it's this tension that I see, which I find so interesting, that God is in a sense

319
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:14,080
 pleading with the world that he will do anything to save the world from itself, even to the

320
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:22,080
 extent of giving himself in this dangerous manner on the cross, this demonstration of

321
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 God's love.

322
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:32,240
 You see, he's not commanding obedience, but he's inviting us a response of love, a response

323
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,280
 over which he has no control.

324
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:44,400
 You see, God places such high value on saving the world, redeeming the world, bringing about

325
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,600
 his creation to what he intended, that he will risk anything, even to the extent of

326
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,520
 sending his son, even to the extent of giving us the free will to choose whether we will

327
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
 follow him.

328
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,480
 And the interesting thing is that we are planted in the middle of that tension as well.

329
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,880
 I think it really is a tension.

330
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,340
 I think my daughter Mia, she's 10 years old, and for most of her life I've been commanding

331
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,200
 obedience from that little girl.

332
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,160
 And she's been giving it by and large.

333
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,840
 But she's now at the age where obviously she's wanting more independence.

334
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,520
 She's wanting to express life and love, and she's wanting to make decisions.

335
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,600
 And I want her to make good decisions and good independent decisions.

336
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,120
 And so there's this stage, isn't there, in parenting where you have to kind of like let

337
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,560
 your children go a little bit, and you have that anxiety and that will they agree, will

338
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,600
 they continue on and follow well, or will they make mistakes?

339
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,080
 And if they make mistakes, I have to let them do that, learn from that.

340
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,000
 But my love is so strong.

341
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,160
 And I kind of feel like that with Mia.

342
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,800
 Now that analogy breaks down between me and God, by the way.

343
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,000
 But in some ways that's what God does in giving his Son.

344
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,280
 He's giving us the kind of freedom to choose to respond to the invitation of grace or not

345
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,560
 to, and that's incredibly scary.

346
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,640
 It is scary.

347
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
 It is scary.

348
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,080
 And the fact that God has entrusted us with this gospel, you know, I think we have to

349
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,640
 somehow take stock of what he has given us because there is a tendency, I believe, for

350
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,560
 us to undervalue it.

351
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,440
 And maybe it's a challenge that we don't always see.

352
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,840
 And so we get used to and very comfortable with our Christianity.

353
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,520
 You know, we come to church on Sundays.

354
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,160
 We learn the stories of Jesus.

355
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,560
 We read the Bible.

356
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,960
 We understand everything that happens there and all the community that we get praying

357
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,920
 together and the support and encouragement and the amazing sermons that we listen to.

358
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:57,600
 And somehow if we're not careful, this can be so comfortable to us that we can tend to

359
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:05,040
 mold it to the shape of our own lives instead of necessarily perhaps seeing the challenge

360
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
 to us.

361
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:14,040
 And I think that we don't always tend to see the radical transformation that God has made

362
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
 in our lives.

363
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,200
 You know, that he's given us this new life, this new opportunity.

364
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,780
 He's changed who we are.

365
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,680
 And sometimes I feel for myself personally that, you know, have I really devalued, have

366
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:35,120
 I really honored and understood the value of that thing which God has taken such trouble

367
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,440
 to give and make available.

368
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,000
 And I like the way that the Apostle Paul talks about the gospel.

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,480
 You know, he doesn't talk about it as a message.

370
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,680
 He doesn't talk about it as, you know, an inspirational word or something that is important

371
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,280
 for us to hear.

372
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
 This is what he says about this gospel.

373
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,080
 He says, "I'm not ashamed of the gospel."

374
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,000
 Now that's a word for us, I think.

375
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,760
 "I'm not ashamed of the gospel," he says, "because it is the power of God to salvation."

376
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,240
 The power of God.

377
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,120
 And so what I think we don't so easily and always appreciate that what God has given

378
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,760
 us in the gospel is the power of God.

379
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,080
 It's a mighty thing.

380
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,360
 It's a powerful word.

381
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,760
 And we somehow, you know, think that we've got so little to offer and that we, you know,

382
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,400
 it's so difficult for us to do or we will not be able to do this thing right or live

383
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
 right.

384
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,720
 But I think we have to understand that within the gospel, there is the power of God.

385
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,800
 And you know, God is so mighty and so powerful and so for us.

386
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,500
 You know, the Bible calls him the Lion of Judah.

387
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,000
 And sometimes I feel that I denigrate him.

388
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,020
 I treat him more like my domesticated cat that sits on my lap, you know.

389
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,120
 And he's the power of God, and that's so important for us to understand.

390
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,400
 So the gospel is perhaps more radical than we think it might be.

391
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,480
 It's perhaps more dangerous.

392
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,220
 It perhaps invites us into understanding life in fresh and new ways, maybe more than we

393
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
 even appreciate.

394
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,060
 And I think there is this power in the gospel that, you know, when we think about what it

395
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,300
 is to live with a different spirit, I think it's this reliance and trust on the power

396
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,860
 of the gospel to be at work, not just in us and through us, but in our city and through

397
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,800
 our city.

398
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,320
 And this is, I think, what's really on your heart, Tony.

399
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,200
 My question out of that, though, would be how do you hold all of this together?

400
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,680
 What sort of metaphor, like how do you actually live out and deal with this kind of type of

401
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
 gospel?

402
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,320
 How do you remember it in your day-to-day lives?

403
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,380
 Well, to do this, I tend to think more about, and I have recently been thinking more about

404
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,320
 the gospel as the kingdom of God.

405
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,580
 You know, that when Jesus came, he said, "The kingdom of God is near you," and all of his

406
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,040
 teaching was about the kingdom of God.

407
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,880
 It's not just a message.

408
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,060
 It's not just something that is spoken, but it's a kingdom that we live in.

409
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:20,260
 And I think that there are a couple of things over the past 50 years or so within the sort

410
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:26,900
 of life and history of the church that have tended to, in some ways, limit the scope,

411
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,020
 the intensity, and the broadness of the gospel.

412
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:37,140
 I think one of those is the sort of traditional message that much of the church has spoken

413
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:44,260
 out that, you know, Jesus came to die on the cross, to save us for our sins so that we

414
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,780
 could go to heaven when we die.

415
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,300
 And of course, there is a central truth about that message.

416
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,500
 But when we just limit it to that, then we miss, I think, something of the broader, the

417
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,020
 grander aspect of the gospel or the kingdom of God that he spoke about.

418
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:08,060
 And another of the trends has been that we have, over the last 50 years, we've modernized

419
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,340
 the gospel, which is good.

420
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,860
 You know, we've realized that we've got to use new language.

421
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,740
 We've got to be able to speak and connect with many people in different ways.

422
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,620
 And I think this communication has been good, and it has made the reality of the gospel

423
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,740
 more real in people's lives.

424
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:33,620
 But at the same time, because it has been molded around us, there's a tendency for it

425
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:39,940
 to become more about me and my life rather than the kingdom of God.

426
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,120
 And so here is the result of this.

427
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,900
 We have a tendency to personalize and privatize the core emphasis of Christianity at the expense

428
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:56,420
 of a broader and richer understanding of its implications, really, on so many aspects of

429
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,100
 our life, our work, our community, and the government, and how we live together.

430
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,340
 I think this is really important, Church, that we kind of really wrestle with this idea

431
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,660
 because I think the reality is, you know, when we think about Jesus and we think about

432
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,860
 His involvement in preaching and teaching in Galilee and the starting of the spread

433
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,380
 of Christianity, when we look at Christ, we think He's, you know, it's tempting for us

434
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,140
 to think that He's just in the world to give a new moral philosophy, or He's kind of in

435
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,940
 the world to tell you how to live your life better and live it in a way that pleases God.

436
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,700
 That's not what Jesus is doing in the gospels.

437
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,200
 He's not trying to tickle your ears and help you to live slightly more morally good or

438
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,540
 ethically better.

439
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,500
 He's actually inaugurating a new reign of the power of God on earth.

440
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,900
 It's the kingdom of God.

441
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
 He's bringing that.

442
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,220
 That's what all of His teaching was about.

443
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,420
 It was all of His parables was about.

444
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,060
 He was trying to help people to understand, you're now living in a new time, a new age.

445
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,380
 The kingdom of God has come, and in Jesus' teaching, His death, and His resurrection,

446
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,960
 that kingdom of God is now here on earth, the now, but not yet.

447
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,700
 We strive and desire for the fullness of that kingdom to come as Jesus returns for a second

448
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,260
 time, but we live in this moment now where we are a part of this radical, dangerous,

449
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:19,780
 incredibly subversive, beautiful, hope-bringing story of a new kingdom, a new way of living,

450
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,300
 and that's really what the gospel is.

451
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:27,860
 It is, and we have to remember that all of this, Jesus' teaching and Jesus' life, was

452
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:34,580
 lived out in a very tense social and political situation.

453
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,820
 Sometimes we like to view Jesus' life like we read in our Sunday school books and our

454
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:48,180
 picture books of green hills and sunshine and rainbows and the nice words of Jesus,

455
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,300
 but really it wasn't like that at all.

456
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:59,020
 When Jesus came, there was really quite a tense situation that was there, that firstly,

457
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:05,680
 in the Jewish social background and political background that He lived in, there was a great

458
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,380
 divide between the rich and the poor and the wealthy.

459
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:17,960
 Those who had power were those who were able to exercise their authority.

460
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,900
 But many of the people that Jesus went to first were those who were marginalised, they

461
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,380
 were the poor, they were the people in the villages around who were in desperate need.

462
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:36,620
 So there was a sudden sense of repression that was going on at that time in Judea.

463
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,140
 The other thing I think we have to remember is that when Jesus was having conversations

464
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,700
 with the rabbis and the people around him, he was not just speaking to the religious

465
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,780
 people, he was talking to the political leaders at that time.

466
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:58,180
 Because society, the leaders constituted the Sanhedrin, which was like their sort of government,

467
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:03,020
 their parliament by which they made decisions for the city and for the people, how they

468
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,020
 would live.

469
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:10,760
 And then of course there was the temple worship itself, which again had great restrictions

470
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,180
 on how people lived and on people's lives as well.

471
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:22,420
 And we see that there is that sort of quite difficult socio-political situation in which

472
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,060
 Jesus lived.

473
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:29,180
 And then if you put on top of all of that the Roman Empire, the Romans who had conquered

474
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:38,700
 them, then you see that they were intent on maintaining peace and stability at any cost,

475
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,580
 including brutal suppression and crucifixion.

476
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,660
 And all around them the sign of their conquest was the thousands of people that they just

477
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,380
 crucified.

478
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,800
 And so there was this domination that was around them.

479
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:01,120
 And so when Jesus spoke about the kingdom of God, it was already in a more immediately

480
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,380
 tense situation than perhaps we tend to think about or appreciate when we read the Gospels.

481
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,100
 I think a lot of that social-political context is lost.

482
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,140
 It's assumed because it's written to people of that day and of that era.

483
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
 They didn't need to explain it.

484
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,060
 It was already a part of the fabric of how people lived their lives.

485
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,100
 And we have to keep it in mind when we read the stories of Jesus.

486
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,180
 There's a moment where Jesus heals, for example, on the Sabbath.

487
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,700
 And on one level it's an amazing story of the miracle transformative power of God, and

488
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
 that's often how we only think of it.

489
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,480
 But actually Jesus does it on the Sabbath because He's also making a message about the

490
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:41,020
 controlling kind of situation of the day and how all the laws had restricted actually the

491
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,180
 work of this kingdom of God.

492
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,140
 And a lot of people were going to miss the power of the kingdom, the true power, because

493
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,940
 they're more conscious of the structures than they were of actually the liberating power

494
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,020
 of God.

495
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,500
 His parable ministry was very much like this as well.

496
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:03,120
 Much of his teaching was designed to say something to the Pharisees, to the rabbis, to the rulers,

497
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,220
 the Jewish rulers and religious leaders of the day, to help them to begin to think differently

498
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,380
 about what this Messiah and this kingdom is going to be all about.

499
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,780
 Yeah, that's true.

500
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:20,220
 And later on, of course, as Christianity developed, you know, we mustn't make the mistake of thinking

501
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:27,220
 that Christianity developed in this neutral, very appealing environment that allowed it

502
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,560
 to spread and to work amongst people.

503
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,580
 We have to appreciate that there were restrictions.

504
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:43,020
 And the truth is this, that God nearly always reveals himself in times of trouble or starts

505
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,520
 something when there is hardship.

506
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:54,120
 And Christianity is often most vigorous when the circumstances are difficult.

507
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,660
 And this is an interesting thing that we need to take on board, I think perhaps in our own

508
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,700
 circumstances as well.

509
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:06,020
 So when Jesus spoke about the kingdom of God, the people who would have listened to him

510
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,060
 would have immediately started connecting the dots to that sort of environment that

511
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,540
 they lived in and not to the religious ones or piety.

512
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:22,580
 And the gospel, of course, would have resonated most strongly with those who were marginalized,

513
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:30,340
 those who were at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum, and with those who were outcasts

514
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,340
 and sinners.

515
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:37,940
 It was them that would have received the freeing message of the gospel.

516
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:46,180
 And so it's not long, you can imagine, before tension started developing within the Jewish

517
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:50,580
 society with what Jesus was preaching and teaching.

518
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,140
 And so I think the challenge for us today and the challenge for many people around the

519
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,700
 world is, are we prepared to live in this tension?

520
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:05,220
 How do we deal with this sort of tension where we have Christians in May conflicting with

521
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,900
 different voices, different pressures around the world?

522
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,500
 And I think the challenge for us also here in Hong Kong is how do we respond to this,

523
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:20,220
 the political, social and political situations that we live in here in Hong Kong?

524
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,140
 I think this is a real challenge that I think Tony's bringing from his heart today, which

525
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,900
 is around how serious are we going to take the gospel?

526
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,540
 First of all, do we understand the gospel in the right context, in the right framework?

527
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,460
 And then how serious are we actually going to take that gospel?

528
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,740
 Are we going to embrace it?

529
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:43,820
 And I know for you, you see that seriousness really sitting in two primary areas, one about

530
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,780
 how we actually live our lives and one about how we actually see ourselves.

531
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,300
 Can you tell us a little bit more about that?

532
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
 Yeah, it is.

533
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:55,340
 And I think that there's a key word here is that we have to reposition ourselves.

534
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:00,580
 I think we have to look at, recreate the sort of mental and spiritual maps of ourselves

535
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,740
 and realise that our primary allegiance is to Jesus.

536
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,460
 That if we are going to be able to make any sense of what's going on, if we're going to

537
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:15,180
 be able to respond or think about how we live in this environment, then we've got to understand

538
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,860
 that our allegiance is firstly to Jesus.

539
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,580
 And you know, it was God's imperative to save the world, but it's our imperative, I think,

540
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:32,220
 to maintain our strong allegiance to Jesus, that he takes first priority in any questions

541
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,660
 or calls of our loyalty or on the things that we do.

542
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:44,300
 And secondly, it's not just about allegiance, but it's also how we see ourselves, our identity.

543
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:51,660
 And this, of course, we understand and know that the core of our Christianity is that

544
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,660
 God has, there's been that new birth.

545
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,460
 We've been reborn into his kingdom.

546
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,540
 We have a new life.

547
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,140
 We have Jesus, but we have the blood of the kingdom running through our veins, those thoughts,

548
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,220
 that spiritual life that we have.

549
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:14,260
 And I think we need to take it a step further and think about our identity, that we are

550
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,020
 not just children of God.

551
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,060
 We have to know which tribe we belong to.

552
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,220
 We are Christians.

553
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,060
 That is our tribe.

554
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:31,340
 And it's interesting that this word, this identity that we so often use to describe

555
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:38,260
 and think about ourselves was not coined by the followers, the disciples of Jesus themselves

556
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,500
 at all.

557
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:47,660
 But it was a name that was given to the followers of Christ in Antioch because of the way they

558
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,040
 lived their lives.

559
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,580
 It was in contrast to the society that was around them, that people were pointing and

560
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,680
 seeing them because they were not living like everyone else.

561
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,700
 They could see that their allegiance was to Jesus.

562
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,940
 They could see that their identity as a people was different.

563
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:13,340
 And so they were a people who were living in contrast to the people around them.

564
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:20,900
 And so the church in Antioch were creating, if you like, an alternative society because

565
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,500
 they believed an alternative narrative to the one everyone else believed and because

566
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,100
 they worshipped a different Lord to the rest of their world.

567
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,220
 And this meant that they were doing crazy things like they were taking babies, caring

568
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,780
 for babies off the street that were abandoned.

569
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,040
 They were looking after their widows.

570
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,920
 They were feeding the poor.

571
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,880
 They were treating their slaves like they were their brothers and sisters.

572
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,700
 Now that may not seem like much to us, but in those times in the Greek or Roman world,

573
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,760
 that was just like, "Whoa, you're doing that?

574
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,320
 How can you possibly do that?"

575
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,160
 So they stood out in the society in which they lived.

576
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:12,040
 And so in a way, their life was like a sort of criticism of the politics and lifestyle

577
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,520
 of AD40.

578
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,200
 And because of that, they became known.

579
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,040
 You are the little Christs.

580
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,520
 You are the people who worship Christ.

581
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,240
 You are the people who worship different gods, different God to us.

582
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,300
 And I think this is going to be so important for us as we grapple with what Christianity

583
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,800
 is going to look like, not just here in Hong Kong, but around the world with all of the

584
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,000
 changes that we're seeing globally happen.

585
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,560
 And I want you to think strongly about where is your allegiance?

586
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,920
 I mean, seriously, like is Jesus Christ your primary allegiance?

587
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,600
 And what is that going to mean for you in the years ahead?

588
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,920
 And do you identify yourself primarily as a Christian more than anything else?

589
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:05,560
 In other words, like you don't identify yourself primarily as Chinese or primarily as English

590
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,960
 or primarily as American or any culture as great as cultures are.

591
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:16,000
 You don't primarily identify yourself as a certain political persuasion, whether you're

592
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 yellow or blue.

593
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,080
 Though you don't primarily identify yourself in various ways, your primarily identity is

594
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,360
 a Christ follower, is Christian.

595
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,360
 And that becomes more important to you than anything else.

596
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,520
 And that drives who you are becoming in the world today.

597
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,400
 Fully committed to Christ, fully believing that you're a part of the tribe of God, this

598
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,360
 kingdom of God, you're a child of God.

599
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:49,320
 And that builds unity and strength and purpose amongst all the people around you.

600
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,880
 That's a different spirit, right?

601
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,440
 That's the gospel at work.

602
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,220
 And it's interesting that you speak of Antioch as an alternative society.

603
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,480
 One thing we're going to be doing in the second half of this year is a book study on Philippians.

604
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,560
 And we're going to be looking at primarily how the church in Philippi lived as an alternative

605
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
 society.

606
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,160
 Now, importantly, not in rebellion to everything around them.

607
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,960
 And it's really important you hear this.

608
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,960
 Not in rebellion.

609
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,640
 They weren't trying to be different to annoy the authorities.

610
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,000
 They were living as Christians, as Christ-like as they can, knowing that in doing that, their

611
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,480
 allegiance was now ultimately to Jesus.

612
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,600
 Knowing that in doing that, they're identifying themselves primarily as Christian before anything

613
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
 else.

614
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,880
 That brings them to helping those babies.

615
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,280
 It brings them to serving the poor.

616
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,760
 It brings them to living in a new way, to loving enemies and all these things.

617
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,360
 And in doing that, they create this alternative environment, this alternative society.

618
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,400
 Does that make sense to you guys?

619
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,560
 And I think that's the beauty of the gospel.

620
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,160
 And that's what we're going to look at in more detail in the second half of the year.

621
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
 Yeah.

622
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,480
 And really, this, I think, is such an exciting time, Church.

623
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,600
 I want to encourage every one of you to really try to think about and assess your own life.

624
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,480
 You know, try to challenge yourself.

625
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
 How do I live?

626
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
 And what's important to me in my life?

627
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,520
 And what are the things I should be doing?

628
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,520
 And how do I react?

629
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,720
 And how do I behave?

630
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:17,000
 And so this different spirit, as I said, I think is a new chapter that we're entering

631
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 as a church.

632
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,320
 And so I really encourage you to follow what we are doing.

633
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,200
 Listen to these series and things that Andrew is preaching.

634
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,080
 They are really important to us.

635
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,160
 And so there's a lot of work to be done.

636
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,240
 There's a lot of work to be done, Church.

637
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,840
 And so together, I think, as we sort of recalibrate, reevaluate what it is God is calling us to

638
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:45,480
 do, then please join us in this adventure and this exciting journey that the church

639
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
 is on together.

640
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,480
 God bless you as you do that.

641
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
 Tony, you are awesome.

642
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
 Could we give Tony a round of applause?

643
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
 What a man.

644
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,480
 What a ledge.

645
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,480
 So grateful.

646
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,640
 I wonder whether we could all just stand together.

647
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,120
 And Tony, I'm going to invite you just to pray for us and pray much of what you've been

648
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,400
 sharing and speaking over us as we respond as a church.

649
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,760
 So why don't we just bow our heads and allow Tony to speak again.

650
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,720
 Thank you so much for all that you have brought us.

651
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:20,600
 Thank you so much for that imperative that you have set upon to save the world, to redeem

652
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,320
 it, to restore the amazing creation.

653
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,240
 And Lord, thank you so much for allowing us to be part of this through Jesus.

654
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,720
 Thank you for your saving grace.

655
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,440
 And Lord, as we step into that place now, help us, Lord God, to step up.

656
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,640
 We ask you, Lord, by your Holy Spirit to encourage us, to give us the strength.

657
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,440
 Lord, as we examine our own lives, we see the opportunities around us.

658
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,040
 Lord, that you would make us brave servants, brave bearers of your gospel, that as we bring

659
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,960
 the good news, you will pour your blessing and the power of your Spirit upon us.

660
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,200
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

661
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
 Amen.

662
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
 Amen.

663
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
 I want you just to take a moment.

664
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,560
 We're going to go into a time just to respond with the Holy Spirit.

665
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,120
 I wonder whether you just close your eyes on me again and just let's allow the Holy

666
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,640
 Spirit just to continue to speak.

667
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,720
 I think Tony shared some real wisdom with us today.

668
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,080
 And perhaps there is something for you to sit in here about your allegiance right now.

669
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:29,640
 Maybe you recognize that there is a split in your allegiance and that you're hearing

670
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,180
 Christ calling you back to the centrality of Him to be primary in your life.

671
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:39,940
 Maybe you're wrestling with that identity as what it means to be a Christian.

672
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,460
 Maybe being a Christ follower is kind of number eight or nine on your list of how you would

673
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,180
 speak about your identity and who you are.

674
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,860
 Maybe the Holy Spirit wants to just challenge you a little bit and speak to you a little

675
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:57,380
 bit about that and remind you of that thing that Paul wrote, "I am not ashamed of the

676
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,380
 gospel to be called a Christ follower."

677
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,780
 Perhaps for some of you it's to just remember the radical nature of God who would send His

678
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:15,740
 only Son so that we would be invited in grace to respond, not by being coerced or forced,

679
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:21,080
 but in freedom to choose Him and to choose Him and to choose Him.

680
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,300
 Perhaps you want to just honor Him and worship Him and glorify Him for making that choice

681
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,300
 today.

682
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,340
 Whatever it might be and how you are to respond, allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in this

683
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,620
 time.

684
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:37,620
 Amen.
