[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760]   Good morning.
[00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.920]   Hey, we're growing, eh?
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.880]   I love it.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.320]   It's wonderful to be back with our family at Vine
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.280]   year long.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.680]   This is always one of my favorite places,
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.760]   quite possibly my number one favorite place.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.480]   Please don't tell everybody in Wanchai.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.360]   Sandra and I love you guys and rejoice what God is doing here.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.640]   We regard you as close personal friends.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:50.760]   But-- but what I'm going to say today actually pains me.
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.260]   Deeply.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:03.320]   I've been involved in church leadership for over 40 years.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.800]   And the biggest conflicts that I've
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.920]   witnessed in churches across the world,
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.560]   the one thing that has caused more arguments
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.480]   and done more collateral damage is worship in church.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.280]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.880]   Worship in church.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.600]   Ironically, the very thing that should be uniting us
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.240]   has often turned into what I call worship wars.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.280]   Did you ever hear the story about the pastor
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.400]   who wanted to move the piano from one side of the church
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.440]   to the other?
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.640]   He knew he couldn't move it just in one Sunday.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.440]   It wasn't a question of physical capability,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.720]   but he knew it wouldn't go over well.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.240]   Everyone was used to the piano being
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.920]   on this side of the stage.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.320]   So instead of a shock and awe approach,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.720]   the pastor decided to be patient.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.880]   Every Sunday, he moved the piano just one inch
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   until eventually it was on the other side.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.760]   When he finished, no one even noticed the change.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.160]   Now for me, growing up in, shall I say,
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.880]   more traditional churches, all my life
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   I've heard this issue brought up more times than I count.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.800]   I was told that rhythmic music, the pattern of sound, silence,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:55.440]   and emphasis in a song was wrong if it was in a minor key,
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.560]   if it was syncopated, or had a set of drums,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.080]   or any percussion instrument for that matter.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.680]   And of course, guitars, especially electric guitars,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.840]   were bad.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.480]   It seemed that every person told me
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.520]   something different about where I should stand with music
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.280]   and why it was all potentially evil.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.120]   I think it's time to hit scripture, don't you?
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.280]   Look at these verses.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.720]   This is Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.400]   You know it well.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.360]   Jesus is describing true worship.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.720]   But the hour is coming and is now here
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.080]   when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.840]   and in truth.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.280]   For the Father is seeking such people to worship him.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.640]   God is spirit, and those who worship him
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.320]   must worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:22.920]   But what is in spirit and truth?
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:30.240]   Is it a certain style of music, dress, and/or liturgy?
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.920]   Is it a proper religious heritage
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   or denominational affiliation?
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.040]   Is it a required volume of biblical knowledge?
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.560]   We just sang "The Heart of Worship" by Matt Redman.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.160]   And I want to tell you the story behind this song.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.960]   Soul Survivor Church in the UK began its ministry in 1993,
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   just outside of London in a place called Walthamstow.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.000]   In a place called Watford.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.760]   And was at the forefront of modern worship,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.880]   what we call modern worship.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.240]   They had innovative weekend services.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.840]   They had worship arts production and active use of multimedia.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.360]   And they were all incorporated to make the church relevant
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.200]   to people's lives.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.520]   But even with all of this, somehow, over time,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.800]   congregation members turned from active worship participants
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.880]   to silent connoisseurs.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.440]   Something amidst the music and the further was missing.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.880]   The lines got blurred.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.280]   And the heart of worship and praise was missing.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.680]   It was at this moment that Soul Survivor Church
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.800]   took drastic action.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.760]   They removed everything from the worship services.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.720]   No microphones, no drums, no guitars, no sound systems
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.600]   were left.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.560]   Sundays had no worship leader, instruments, or amplified
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.040]   sound.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.760]   Can you imagine that?
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.600]   Could you imagine if you came today?
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.200]   There was none of that.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.800]   The attendees of this UK church couldn't at first.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.120]   But this is the point.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.480]   They had much more than powerful sound systems
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.120]   and eye-catching multimedia.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.920]   And as soon as their voices were lifted together to God,
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.800]   as soon as their hearts were united in prayer,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.440]   the silence disappeared.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.280]   And the period of apathy was demolished.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.240]   Now, step by step, the equipment was returned.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.200]   But since then, it has never played a more important role
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.000]   than people's voices.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.600]   The worship pastor at that time, Matt Redman,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.120]   wrote the song "The Heart of Worship"
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.400]   during these unusual worship sessions.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.640]   It was just his personal reflection
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.120]   of what was happening around him.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.000]   All of the stuff that was forming
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.240]   the story behind the song and the result
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.440]   is the song we just sang.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:53.640]   When the music fades, all is stripped away.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.600]   I simply come longing just to bring
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.720]   something that's of worth that will bless your heart.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.440]   I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.640]   And it's all about you, Jesus.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.200]   It's all about you.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.960]   The heart of worship is about self-examination,
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.880]   not only in matters of worship, but in our lives.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.920]   I need to tell you this.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.000]   Jesus came into the world to build a people who
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.800]   would be true worshipers.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.000]   Let me say it again.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.680]   Jesus came into the world to build a people who
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.120]   would be true worshipers.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.000]   In the verses before our passage I'm
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.280]   going to cover this morning, we see the Pharisees--
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.120]   I love the Pharisees, don't you?
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.880]   The religious people rejecting the one who called out to them.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.600]   They were the religious people of the time.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.000]   Jesus said to them, these people honor me with their lips,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.720]   but their heart is far from me.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.840]   My goodness.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.000]   We wouldn't want him saying that about the Vineyard
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.400]   along this morning, right?
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.840]   Honor me with their lips, but their heart is--
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.640]   in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.360]   the commandments of men.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.800]   Even Simon Peter failed to grasp exactly
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.080]   what was the heart of worship.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.520]   And we read that Jesus said to him, Peter said to him,
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.480]   explain the parable to us.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:51.920]   And he, Jesus, said, are you still without understanding?
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.600]   You see, my friends, tradition is something external.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:09.040]   While God's truth is internal, it's in the heart.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.920]   People can obey tradition to please men
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:21.240]   and gain status, but we obey the words to please God.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.960]   Tradition deals with ritual, while God's truth
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.080]   deals with reality.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.400]   Tradition brings empty words to the lips,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.840]   but truth penetrates the heart and changes the life.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.320]   Actually, tradition potentially robs a person
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.280]   of the power of the word of God.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.240]   And this incident with the religious leaders
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.120]   and the disciples is particularly significant.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.440]   As it sets up, what happens next?
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:09.200]   Jesus takes radical action.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.920]   Let's read this.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:18.880]   And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.680]   of Tyre and Sidon.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.200]   I've put a map on the screen.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:32.160]   Jesus leaves the Galilee region, and he
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:39.960]   goes northwest to the coastal areas of Tyre and Sidon.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.120]   Now, they're in modern-day Lebanon.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.960]   And I just want to just pause for a moment there
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.000]   for a moment.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.440]   Lebanon is very much in the news today.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.400]   And really, just to ask you this week,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.960]   please pray for Lebanon and the situation in the Middle East.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:04.440]   Now, Tyre was about 35 miles from Capernaum,
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.840]   and Sidon was a 50-mile walk.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.960]   Maybe this took two or three days.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.560]   Now, this is actually very significant.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.640]   This is the only time in Jesus' public ministry
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.440]   that he steps into strictly Gentile territory.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.640]   Gentiles were the non-Jews, right?
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.580]   This is the only recorded time that we
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:38.920]   have that Jesus stepped into strictly Gentile territory.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:43.760]   Not only did Jesus teach that no foods were unclean,
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.280]   but he practiced this by going into Gentile territory.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.840]   He was also seeking to refresh himself
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.900]   from the increasing conflicts, especially
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.920]   with the religious people, and to withdraw a bit
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.040]   from the large crowds that were following him.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:10.080]   And as he withdrew to a place of solitude,
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:17.840]   he actually meets a woman with a true heart of worship.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:25.840]   He meets a woman with a true heart of worship.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.760]   Mark 7:24 tells us that Jesus was actually
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.000]   trying to remain hidden.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.760]   He was on sabbatical, right?
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:39.400]   But somehow, this Canaanite woman heard where he was
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.360]   and came to her with his need.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.100]   But she wasn't what you expect.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.340]   She didn't tick all the boxes.
[00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.280]   She wasn't baptized, confirmed, leading a small group,
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.920]   pillar of the church, studying for a theology degree,
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.240]   none of the above.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.520]   One writer has said, there is no incident
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.360]   in our Lord's earthly ministry more puzzling than this.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.080]   And so it begs investigation.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.200]   I mean, look at her entrance.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.440]   You've got it up there.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.160]   And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.400]   came out and was crying, have mercy on me,
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.800]   oh Lord, son of David.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.680]   My daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:43.600]   She begins with a plea for mercy.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.840]   The cry, Lord, have mercy, kyrie eleison in Greek,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.560]   has been described as the most prayed prayer in the Bible.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:01.080]   But notice, she also calls Jesus the son of David,
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:08.280]   a messianic term coming from the lips of a Gentile, a non-Jew.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.120]   She was clearly convinced about the person she was addressing.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   Now let's press in.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.840]   Note the significance.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.600]   Have mercy on me.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.400]   Have mercy on me, oh Lord.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:38.560]   It was her daughter that was demon possessed.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:45.760]   But it is the mom who feels the weight, the fear, the despair,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.040]   the hopelessness.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.880]   Any parent who's had teenagers would identify with this.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:02.000]   And of course, she was warmly welcomed by the disciples.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.080]   Not, no way, Jose.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.360]   Indeed, their response was underwhelming,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.160]   to say the least.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.480]   Let's read it.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.800]   "But he," that's Jesus, "did not answer her word.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:28.200]   And his disciples came and begged him, send her away,
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.360]   for she's crying out after us."
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.000]   Now this really throws us off balance.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   In Matthew 9, we read the story that Jairus was
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.820]   pleading for his little girl.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.480]   And Jesus immediately takes steps to come to her aid.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.280]   Now this woman comes to Jesus to seek mercy for her daughter.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.800]   And Jesus seemingly ignores her.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.280]   And the disciples began a hostile counterattack.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.240]   Send her away, she's not one of us.
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:13.920]   A marginalized woman becoming even more marginalized.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.880]   Van Yon Long, there is a practical outreach for us,
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.600]   an outworking of this.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.160]   When we come to church, we like to talk to our friends
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.600]   or with the dudes who are cool and popular.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:37.020]   But how do we react when it's a beggar, a street sleeper,
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:42.980]   a drug addict, or an LGBT member,
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.260]   or someone from another generation,
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.180]   or a different color?
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.540]   It begs a serious question.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.540]   How does it feel when you are talking to someone
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.720]   and that person ignores you?
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.760]   Let's take it up a notch.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.880]   How does that feeling change when
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:10.680]   you factor in the importance of the person you are talking to?
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.360]   When you talk to God about things,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.480]   does it ever seem like he's ignoring you?
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.120]   Does it feel wonderful?
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.720]   I think not.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:30.780]   This woman is not just passing the time.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.300]   She's not commenting on the weather.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.980]   Isn't it hard?
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.200]   She's not commenting on the weather or the Hang Seng Index.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.500]   She has a demon-possessed daughter.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.260]   I mean, she needs help.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.340]   And the person who can help her is standing right
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:49.940]   in front of her.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.560]   As Jesus' fame had grown, people from all over the region
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.320]   were drawn to him for help and rescue.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.880]   She'd obviously heard these stories.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.240]   And fueled by the anguish for her daughter,
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.520]   comes to Jesus and bears her soul to him.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.800]   I want you to picture the scene here.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.760]   The mom is shouting her head off.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.900]   The disciples were having their five cents worth.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:29.420]   On the other hand, Jesus was standing silently
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.900]   in the eye of the storm, rather like he
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:39.020]   was on the Sea of Galilee before he calmed the storm.
[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.180]   The Canaanite woman must have felt
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.060]   like she was being put on hold.
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.240]   No one likes to be put on hold, do they?
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.160]   I don't know about you.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.320]   I really detest these so-called hotlines,
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.920]   which are not so hot.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.800]   Our lines are very busy.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.720]   Your call is important to us, yeah, right?
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.960]   So please hold on, and one of our customer services
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.760]   representatives will be with you shortly.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.720]   That's a lie.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.660]   And then we're subject to either canned music or a barrage
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.580]   of advertisements.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:27.200]   The dialogue then becomes even more difficult to understand.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:34.360]   He, Jesus, answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.560]   of the house of Israel.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.660]   Did Jesus really tell her he wouldn't help her
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.080]   because of her ethnicity?
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.920]   I mean, we've had examples in the 20th century, haven't we?
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.080]   Churches in America, South Africa, no blacks allowed.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.400]   You know, we've had that.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.280]   And no doubt, the disciples were cheering in the background.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.360]   This is getting more puzzling by the moment.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.080]   But look at her response.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:10.320]   She came before him and knelt.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   She knelt before him saying, Lord, help me.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.360]   We cannot but admire the patience and the persistence
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.160]   of this Gentile mother.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   Lord, help me was her next plea.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.100]   This time, she avoided any messianic titles.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:38.000]   She came as a sinner needing help.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.320]   And she offered no argument.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.960]   Lord, help me.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.880]   Now consider this.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.520]   This woman appears to have been ignored, rejected, and insulted
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.120]   by Jesus.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.200]   And still she comes forward and offers her worship to him.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.560]   Surely, surely now Jesus will help
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.680]   this woman and her daughter.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.160]   But it gets even more intriguing.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.680]   If you can work this out, come and tell me afterwards.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.840]   And he, Jesus said, is not right to take children's bread
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.440]   and throw it to the dogs.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.760]   What?
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.120]   Just when you think things can't get any worse,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.920]   Jesus appears to call her a dog.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.480]   Now actually, in his reply, Jesus
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.080]   did not call her a dog in the way
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.720]   the Pharisees would have addressed a Gentile.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.840]   The Greek word here means a little pet dog and not
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.760]   the filthy disease-carrying mongrels that ran the streets
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.520]   and ate the garbage.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.400]   The children referred, of course,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   to the people of Israel.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.120]   But I need to tell you, Jesus wasn't
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.400]   playing games with the woman.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.960]   Nor was he trying to make the situation more difficult.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.520]   What he was trying to do is draw out of her
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   a growing response of faith.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:16.600]   And she didn't disappoint.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.280]   This is one of my favorite verses.
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.560]   She said, yes, Lord.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.280]   But even the dogs eat the crumbs that
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.360]   fall from their master's table.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.480]   She refuses to let go.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.280]   She immediately seized on the illustration
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.920]   about the children's bread, which was exactly what he
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.000]   wanted her to do.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.600]   We may paraphrase her reply.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:47.600]   It is true that we Gentiles do not sit at the table
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.560]   as children and eat the bread.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.600]   But even the pet dogs under the table
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.640]   can eat some of the crumbs.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.000]   Now, Sandra and I understand this.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.800]   Our pet husky, Lexi, parks herself under our dining table
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.240]   at dinner time, ready for the smallest
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.080]   crumb to drop from our plate.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.920]   But what a tremendous testimony of faith.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.640]   She was, in effect, saying, I'll gladly accept
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.360]   the crumbs under your table, but only if it
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.800]   is your table in your house.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.680]   I've got no desire to deprive your children.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:37.520]   Just let a crumb of grace fall to help my child.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   I accept your invitation, and I trust you to meet my need.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:51.280]   It was this faith that Jesus acknowledged.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.560]   And immediately, he healed a daughter.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.120]   Then Jesus answered her, oh, woman, how great is your faith.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.880]   Be it done for you as you desire.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.800]   And her daughter was healed instantly.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:17.000]   The question you might ask, why didn't he do that an hour ago?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.120]   It is worth noting that both of the people
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.200]   in the Gospel of Matthew who were described
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.480]   as having great faith were Gentiles, the Canaanite woman
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.000]   and the Roman centurion in Matthew 8.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.640]   In both cases-- get this one--
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:45.320]   in both cases, Jesus healed the one in need from a distance.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:49.200]   Now, why?
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.360]   Because spiritually speaking, the Gentiles
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.560]   were a far off until Calvary, when
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.360]   Jesus died for both Jews and Gentiles
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.640]   and made reconciliation possible.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.920]   This woman's faith was great because she persisted
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.960]   in asking and trusting when everything, everything
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.320]   seemed against her.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.160]   Certainly, her race was against her.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.080]   She was a Gentile.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.320]   Her sex was against her.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   For most Jewish rabbis paid little attention to women.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.760]   It seemed that the disciples were against her.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.080]   And Christ's words might have led her to believe
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.120]   that even he was against her.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.360]   All of these obstacles only made her persist further.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:47.320]   Now, I've got a theory here.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.360]   This was bizarre, right?
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   Totally bizarre.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.920]   This bizarre exchange was actually for the disciples.
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:08.180]   This bizarre exchange was actually
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.760]   for the benefit of the disciples.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.720]   They had been brought up in a particular religious system.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.760]   It needed them to be taken out of their comfort zone,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.240]   their comfort zone of Palestine, to find a new reference
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.080]   point for what the heart of worship looks like.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:40.680]   It was more than being fascinated by his teaching
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.400]   or impressed by his miracles.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:51.120]   The appropriate response was humble faith and worship.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.920]   And this Canaanite woman had demonstrated this heart
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.440]   clearly.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.760]   The next verse, verse 29, is very telling.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:09.000]   "Jesus went on from there and walked
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.440]   beside the Sea of Galilee."
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.100]   Now, most people would have missed this,
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.640]   because you would finish at verse 28.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.200]   Look at what's happened.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.760]   "Jesus turns his men around and heads back to Galilee.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.920]   Two to three days' walk, only to immediately walk back
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   another two to three days."
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   Let me put this in context.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.440]   It was the equivalent of getting out of here at lunchtime,
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:42.760]   walking to Guangzhou for dim sum lunch,
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.800]   because we all know it's better and cheaper there, right?
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.640]   Turning around and immediately walking back to Yuen Long.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:29:01.840]   My friends, I believe this was no random visit.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:08.720]   Jesus had come for this woman and her daughter.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   Why?
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.680]   Because he wanted to teach his disciples for them
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.280]   to encounter a heart of worship.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:27.920]   He reached across both geographical, ethnic, religious,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.720]   and cultural boundaries to reach her and to teach them.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.880]   And what I've come this morning to tell you is this.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.560]   I'll put it on the screen.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:49.720]   He wants to both reach us and to teach us.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.800]   He wants to both reach us and teach us.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.040]   The Father reached us by sending his Son.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:04.720]   Jesus reached us by entering into everything we face
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.080]   and struggle with in life.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:18.680]   Our response is to give him our worship and trust,
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:25.920]   to give him our lives totally.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.400]   We're going to sing a response song in a moment.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.680]   If the band will just get ready in a moment.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.720]   Going back to my first point about worship in church,
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.480]   this song was not written in the past couple of years.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.880]   It was written 1896, 128 years ago.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.120]   Look at some of the words we're going to be singing.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.840]   I'll put them on the screen.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.680]   All to Jesus I surrender.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.960]   All to him I freely give.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:15.520]   I will ever love and trust him in his presence daily live.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.600]   All to Jesus I surrender.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.840]   Humbly at his feet I bow.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.280]   Worldly pleasures all forsaken.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.480]   Take me, Jesus.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.280]   Take me now.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.080]   I surrender all.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.840]   All means all.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.800]   I surrender all.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:47.760]   All to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:55.480]   I'm going to invite you to do something different this morning.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.640]   I want to invite you to be like the Canaanite woman.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.880]   Come before Jesus.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.720]   And kneel before him.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.240]   We don't do that in church very often, do we?
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.880]   I'm going to challenge you this morning.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.480]   If you're unable to move physically to kneel, that's OK.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:20.480]   I'm going to challenge us to kneel and say,
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:28.400]   Lord, have mercy on me as we sing this song.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.440]   As we sing this song together.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.240]   And I want to speak to anybody here this morning who is not
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.720]   yet following Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:46.960]   This is your opportunity now to come and give
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.920]   your life to Jesus Christ.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.120]   And I'm going to invite you as we kneel,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.120]   as we kneel before the throne, as we say, Lord, have mercy,
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:06.160]   as we sing this beautiful old song to kneel and to give
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.360]   your life to Jesus Christ.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:12.480]   And if you do that, speak to somebody afterwards,
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.240]   and we'd love to pray for you.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   So church, year long church, this
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.520]   is a time of rededication for us.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.840]   If you're happy to do that, I'm probably
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.760]   one of the oldest here.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.920]   It's going to be more difficult for me than kneeling
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.480]   than anybody.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.040]   If you'd like to join me in kneeling,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.240]   we'll sing this song together.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
