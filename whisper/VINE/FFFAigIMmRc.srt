1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
 - Amen, hey, can we thank our worship team

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,800
 for just the way they serve.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,340
 Have a seat, have a seat.

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,600
 Welcome to the Vine.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
 If you're relatively new with us,

6
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,120
 my name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,860
 I'm so glad that you're a part of this.

8
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,360
 And we've been in a long series in the book of Exodus.

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,240
 And last week we got to the midpoint

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,440
 of the whole of the book of Exodus, chapters 19 and 20.

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,280
 And in chapters 19 and 20, we see a very important moment

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,480
 that Israel, who have been now set free

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,320
 from the slavery of their past,

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,400
 they now come to God's presence at Mount Sinai.

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,200
 And as they come to God's presence at Mount Sinai,

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,160
 they come into that presence and they realize

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,360
 that all that God has done for them

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,360
 is to bring them to himself.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,160
 And just like we've been experiencing in worship

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,400
 and just praying just a moment ago

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 that God has done all of that work of liberation,

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,080
 who's come and done the plagues and provided for his people

23
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,880
 and brought them into his presence,

24
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,680
 because in his presence, he wants to now speak to them.

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,920
 And what we saw last week was something fascinating

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,480
 that although Israel was now free

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,240
 and were at the presence of God in the mountain,

28
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,240
 at Mount Sinai, they had a serious issue.

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,480
 And their serious issue was,

30
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,860
 despite the reality that they were free,

31
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,600
 they had no idea who they were.

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,080
 And God comes to them and says, I've shown you who I am.

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,380
 Now it's time for you to discover who you are.

34
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,360
 And we saw last week that the primary thing

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,920
 that slavery does to all of us,

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,120
 whether that's slavery to sin, slavery to our brokenness,

37
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,800
 slavery to our past, whatever it is,

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,640
 whatever it is that is enslaving our heart,

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,400
 enslaving our minds, causing us anxiety and stress,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
 whatever that is,

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,100
 it is designed to strip your identity from you.

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,280
 The very definition of slavery,

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,840
 when people are trying to enslave people,

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,640
 what they try to do is strip the identity

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,040
 of that person away from them.

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,760
 So they have no choice.

47
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
 They have no freedom of expression,

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
 their freedom of thought.

49
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,280
 They're forced to do just what the other person

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,160
 tells them to do.

51
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,280
 And Israel has had that for 200 years.

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,800
 And now they've come to Mount Sinai.

53
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,040
 And they're like, we have no idea who we are

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,720
 because everything has been stripped from us.

55
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,680
 And we said last week that that's the reality

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,440
 for so many of us in this room as well.

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,960
 That just freeing ourselves from sin

58
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,280
 as Christ does on the cross

59
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,560
 means that we're now in a identity vacuum.

60
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,360
 And we're now trying to go, okay, who am I now to be?

61
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,480
 I know I'm free, but what am I being created free to do?

62
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,960
 And everything in chapters 19 and 20 of Exodus

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,640
 is God coming to his people and going,

64
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,800
 this is what you're free for.

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,160
 This is now who you are.

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,240
 This is how I now want you to live.

67
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,240
 And he speaks to them about his character

68
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
 that he's placed in them.

69
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,480
 And the first thing that happens, as we saw last week

70
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,720
 with Moses on Mount Sinai in chapter 19,

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,500
 is God says, here are two things

72
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,440
 that you need to know about yourself.

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,320
 You're a kingdom of priests and you're a holy nation.

74
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,160
 And this dual idea of being a kingdom of priests

75
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,840
 and a holy nation forms the foundation of Israel's identity

76
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,280
 but also our identity as well.

77
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
 When God speaks about being this idea

78
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,960
 of a kingdom of priests,

79
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,940
 the priest really had three functions.

80
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,780
 It was to connect God and the world together.

81
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,880
 They were the ones that interceded and stood in the gap

82
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,080
 between God and the world.

83
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,160
 All of the things that they could see happening in the world

84
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,680
 and they know of God's heart,

85
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,200
 they wanted to see those two things come together.

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,720
 The second thing that the priest would do

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
 is that they would invite people

88
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,200
 to come and experience the presence of God.

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,760
 They would create an environment

90
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,600
 by which people could encounter his presence,

91
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,280
 knowing that if they could just encounter

92
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,680
 the presence of God, they would be changed.

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,720
 And then the third thing that the priest did

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,580
 is to help them to understand,

95
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,480
 not only is it about being kind of invited

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,400
 into the presence of God,

97
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,000
 but now we're called to imitate God's character in the world.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,980
 The priests were imitators of the character of God

99
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,840
 so that they could show everyone in the world

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,440
 what God's character and his heart

101
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,420
 and his love actually looked like.

102
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,040
 So when God says to Moses, here's who you are,

103
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
 you're a kingdom of priests,

104
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,000
 he's saying, you're a bunch of people

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,360
 that can connect people to God,

106
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,240
 invite people into his presence,

107
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,040
 and actually come and do that in a way

108
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,160
 that imitates the life and the glory

109
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,800
 and the love and the character of God.

110
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,920
 And then he says, you're a holy nation.

111
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,600
 We saw last week that that meant two primary things.

112
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,240
 It's the idea of being transformed

113
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,560
 by the power of the spirit of God in us.

114
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
 And when we're transformed,

115
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,440
 we are able to deal with some of that slavery

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,260
 that we carry around with us.

117
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,200
 Some of the faulty thinking that is in our mind,

118
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,560
 some of the core false beliefs that we hold onto,

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
 we're transformed, as the scripture says,

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,800
 by the renewing of our mind.

121
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,080
 The spirit of God transforms us

122
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,240
 both personally and communally together.

123
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,180
 But being a holy nation was also about being set apart.

124
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,480
 It was about being set apart for the world,

125
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,080
 not set apart like be weird in the world,

126
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,040
 but set apart for the world.

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
 Not to be a monastery up on a hill that kind of goes,

128
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
 oh, I don't wanna be in that mucky thing called the world.

129
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
 Actually, God saves us, creates the church,

130
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,200
 'cause he wants the church planted in the heart of society,

131
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
 in the heart of the world,

132
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,940
 and that we would be a community of hope

133
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,280
 wrapped around a community of pain.

134
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,640
 That we would be ones who would say,

135
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,260
 yeah, we're set apart because we wanna offer the world

136
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,360
 an alternative narrative.

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,120
 That where things are stressed and anxious,

138
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
 we can offer peace and hope.

139
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,920
 When people are angry and violent, we can show another way.

140
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
 Where we can live in such a way

141
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,980
 that we take the character of God,

142
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,480
 we bring it down to this world,

143
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,880
 and we say there is another way to live.

144
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,160
 This is all chapter 19.

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,240
 And God says to Israel,

146
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,120
 this is who you need to know who you are,

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,160
 because I've set you free for a purpose.

148
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,980
 But the culmination of this comes in chapter 20

149
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,920
 that we're looking at today.

150
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,480
 Because in chapter 20, God takes it a step further.

151
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,000
 He's laid that foundation of priests and holiness,

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,020
 but in his presence, he takes it a step further.

153
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,200
 And what he basically says is, look,

154
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,940
 I've revealed myself through how I've acted amongst you.

155
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,340
 You've seen what I've done,

156
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,280
 and that helps you understand who I am.

157
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,480
 Now I'm gonna speak to you about your actions.

158
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,360
 I'm gonna speak to you about

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,760
 how you should interact with one another,

160
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,980
 how you should walk with each other,

161
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,160
 how you should be in relationship with me,

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,440
 relationship with yourself,

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,520
 relationship with others, and relationship with the world.

164
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 And God comes to Moses

165
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
 and does something on the top of Mount Sinai

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,980
 that up until that point,

167
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,840
 he had never done before for his people.

168
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
 And the thing that he does changes them forever.

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,200
 The Jewish people today, as well as us Christians,

170
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,600
 we take so much of who we are

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
 in this one moment right here in Exodus 20.

172
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,920
 And to show you what happens in that moment,

173
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,600
 let me take you back once again

174
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
 to the top of Mount Sinai.

175
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,480
 (gentle music)

176
00:06:48,480 --> 00:07:03,540
 Last episode, we journeyed together

177
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,240
 from the foothills of Mount Sinai

178
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,440
 right up here to the summit.

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
 And we saw Moses's journey in a different light

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
 and how difficult it would have been

181
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,120
 for him to actually make that ascent,

182
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
 but also the call that God had on him

183
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
 to come up here and meet him face to face.

184
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,920
 But something also happens on the top of the summit

185
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,760
 that actually reshapes not just Moses's life,

186
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,240
 but the life and the character of Israel itself.

187
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,480
 And to help you to understand that a little bit more,

188
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,520
 I wanna introduce you to a chapel,

189
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,720
 a chapel that sits on the top of Mount Sinai here,

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
 and tell you a little bit

191
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,740
 about the thing that reshapes God's people.

192
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,320
 In the fourth century, Julian of the Euphrates

193
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,840
 built a chapel at the peak of Mount Sinai,

194
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
 so worshipers would have a place to shelter

195
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,680
 and perform religious ceremonies at the very place

196
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,760
 where God's presence was thought to have been revealed.

197
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,360
 Later in that same century,

198
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,740
 the Emperor Justinian ordered the construction

199
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,440
 of a three-aisled basilia here at the same site.

200
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,720
 The present chapel of the Holy Trinity,

201
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,540
 a private Greek Orthodox church,

202
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,000
 was completed in 1935,

203
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,920
 and now rests at the eastern end of the original complex.

204
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,100
 It amazes me that right here at the top of Mount Sinai,

205
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,060
 worshipers can actually gather in a church building

206
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,980
 around a priest who is able to perform religious services.

207
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,780
 The chapel itself is truly breathtaking,

208
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,940
 and is a powerful reminder of something

209
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,280
 that we see right in the text of Exodus 19 and 20.

210
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,960
 When God gives Moses the law here on the top of Mount Sinai,

211
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,440
 it's because he desires to be

212
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,640
 an intimate relationship with his people.

213
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,960
 He wants his people to come into his presence,

214
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,040
 and he wants to bring his presence to them.

215
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
 And that's what I love about this Greek Orthodox chapel

216
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,600
 right here on the summit,

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,240
 because people are still gathering

218
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,920
 to worship God right in this place.

219
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,600
 This is still the intimate presence of God,

220
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,680
 and it truly is special just being in here.

221
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,760
 You know, often we think of the Ten Commandments

222
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,120
 as rules, as boundaries, as a strict law

223
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,680
 that we're afraid to break, but it's not like that at all.

224
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
 The Ten Commandments was God's way of saying,

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,760
 "I want you to know who I am, and I wanna be your God.

226
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,880
 "I wanna be connected intimately with you."

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,200
 And the chapel here today is still a living legacy

228
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,440
 to that very moment.

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,840
 And here is what is fascinating about all of that.

230
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,600
 You see, while God had placed some stringent laws

231
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,880
 about who was allowed to ascend up into his presence,

232
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,820
 the giving of the law to Moses was God's way of saying,

233
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,940
 "I want to now descend down the mountain

234
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,600
 "and be with my people."

235
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,920
 It was God saying, "Here is my character,

236
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,120
 "here is my nature, and I don't want all of your life

237
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,480
 "to be about some mountaintop experience."

238
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
 You see, the Christian life isn't always about ascending

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
 up to the top of the mountain with God.

240
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
 Actually, the beauty of the Christian life,

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
 seen through the story of the Exodus,

242
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,680
 is that God has descended the mountain.

243
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,620
 God has come down with us, and he now meets us

244
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,400
 in the power of his presence in the everyday,

245
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,660
 even in the mundane things that we struggle with in life,

246
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,040
 God is there.

247
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,880
 And that is why this moment on the top of Mount Sinai

248
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,280
 for Moses, receiving of the law, is so critical,

249
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,840
 not just for them in history, but right here now.

250
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,420
 (gentle music)

251
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:39,600
 It was a real privilege to be able to get into that chapel.

252
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
 It's not actually generally open for tourists.

253
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,360
 It literally is at the top of Mount Sinai.

254
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,400
 And it's strictly reserved for those

255
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,480
 of the Greek Orthodox tradition,

256
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,920
 and they gave us permission to film in there,

257
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,560
 which I was very grateful for,

258
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,360
 'cause I wanted to show you something of that presence,

259
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,400
 that holiness, that awe of God in that place.

260
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,720
 And it's in that moment where God draws Moses

261
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,760
 into his presence, that out of that place of awe

262
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,560
 and holiness, he speaks these words.

263
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,660
 Let me read you Exodus 20.

264
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,080
 And God spoke these words.

265
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,120
 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt,

266
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,920
 out of the land of slavery.

267
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,240
 You shall have no other gods before me.

268
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,040
 You shall not make yourself an idol

269
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,560
 in the form of anything in heaven above

270
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,160
 or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

271
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,600
 You should not bow down to them or worship them,

272
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,280
 for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God,

273
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,080
 punishing the children for the sin of their fathers

274
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,960
 to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,

275
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,040
 but showing love to a thousand generations

276
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,080
 of those who love me and keep my commands.

277
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,640
 You should not misuse the name of your Lord, your God.

278
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,040
 The Lord will not hold anyone guiltless

279
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,120
 who misuses his name.

280
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,000
 Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,920
 for on the seventh day it's a Sabbath to the Lord your God.

283
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,560
 On it you shall do no work at all,

284
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,280
 neither you nor your son or your daughter,

285
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,540
 nor your manservant, your maidservant, nor your animals,

286
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,000
 nor the alien within your gates.

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,680
 For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth

288
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,560
 and the sea and all that is in them,

289
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,320
 but he rested on the seventh day.

290
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,000
 Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,280
 Honor your father and your mother

292
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,720
 so that you may live long in the land

293
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,940
 that the Lord your God is giving you.

294
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,000
 You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,680
 and you should not steal.

296
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,400
 You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor,

297
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,600
 and you shall not covet your neighbor's house.

298
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
 You shall not covet your neighbor's wife

299
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,640
 or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey,

300
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,920
 or really anything that belongs to your neighbor.

301
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,840
 These words are perhaps some of the most famous

302
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,160
 that we have in scripture.

303
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,640
 And whether you've been a Christian all your life

304
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,840
 or you're relatively new to faith,

305
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,000
 you've probably heard something of these words.

306
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,880
 We call them the 10 commandments,

307
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,320
 but actually that word is not in the Bible at all.

308
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,040
 The biblical context to these words in the Hebrew

309
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,040
 means literally the 10 words, the decalogue, the 10 words.

310
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,120
 And what's fascinating about these words

311
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,880
 is that they are central to both the Jewish

312
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,540
 and the Christian faith.

313
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,800
 But because they're so familiar to us,

314
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,300
 it's really easy for us when it comes to God's law,

315
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,420
 the 10 commandments, for us to assume

316
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,960
 that we understand what they're about

317
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,600
 and therefore take a certain posture towards them.

318
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,920
 And what I wanna do with you today

319
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,080
 is actually open up a fresh perspective for you

320
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,120
 about what these laws are all about.

321
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,520
 I want you to understand and to hear God's heart behind them

322
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,440
 'cause what's critical is not necessarily

323
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,840
 just what they're saying, but it's the character

324
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,040
 and the identity both of God and ourselves

325
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,480
 that God is trying to communicate through them.

326
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,880
 Let me start by telling you

327
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,480
 what the 10 commandments are not.

328
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,980
 They are not a bunch of legalistic rules

329
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,160
 that are designed to basically constrain you,

330
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,600
 hold you back, and make your life miserable.

331
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,200
 These are not rules that are created

332
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,840
 so that you're suddenly in a whole bunch

333
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,100
 of red tape with God, okay?

334
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,100
 Remember that God has just set his people free from slavery.

335
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,980
 The last thing God wants to do

336
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,720
 is put his people back in slavery.

337
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,840
 But so often we look at these laws

338
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,680
 and we think they're designed to basically shackle us

339
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,200
 and hold us back and strip all the joy out of life.

340
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,260
 These are not prison bars.

341
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,800
 They're really just traffic laws.

342
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
 And traffic laws are important.

343
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,240
 See, when you drive a car,

344
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,200
 you have the freedom to drive wherever you want.

345
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,000
 You can drive down the wrong side of the road

346
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,080
 if you want to.

347
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,340
 No one's actually gonna stop you in the moment, right?

348
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,640
 You have freedom.

349
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,040
 But we have traffic laws,

350
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,560
 and those traffic laws are created with lines on the road

351
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,420
 and lights and signs to help you

352
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,440
 to safely arrive at the destination that you want to go to.

353
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,920
 And if everybody stays within their lane

354
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,340
 and within those traffic laws,

355
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,680
 we're able to operate as a successful society

356
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,060
 and get efficiently to where we want to go.

357
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,280
 The law, these 10 commandments, they're kind of like that.

358
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,680
 No one's gonna shackle you.

359
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,360
 They're not designed to hold you back.

360
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,260
 No one's gonna force you to do them either.

361
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,620
 They're God's path of life.

362
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,940
 It's like God saying, "I have a destination for you.

363
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,720
 "I have somewhere where I want you to go."

364
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,980
 And within this structure, there is life.

365
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,580
 Within this structure, there is flourishing,

366
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,460
 there's safety, there's health.

367
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,600
 If we live this way, there is a certain flourishing

368
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,100
 that comes not just for us, but also for those around us.

369
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,740
 Did you get that?

370
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,280
 The second thing is that the 10 commandments

371
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,460
 are not a bunch of rules that you follow

372
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,380
 in order to gain your salvation

373
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,100
 or to gain more love of God.

374
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
 And I think so often we think of these in that way.

375
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,080
 We think, "Oh man, if I can just be a better Christian,

376
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,900
 "if I could just try to live with the law

377
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,000
 "a little bit better, if I could try to adhere

378
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,180
 "to the 10 commandments more,

379
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,480
 "I'm going to either earn my salvation

380
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,360
 "or I'm gonna get more of God's blessings.

381
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,720
 "I'm gonna get more of His favor.

382
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,400
 "I'm gonna get more of His love."

383
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 Salvation and God's love is not the reward of God's law.

384
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,640
 It's the reason why we wanna live out God's law.

385
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,240
 Are you following this, church?

386
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,640
 It's not the reward.

387
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,080
 We don't follow the law and then check a box

388
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,260
 and God goes, "Well done."

389
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,660
 And He puts a medal over us and says,

390
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,340
 "Congratulations, I love you now."

391
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,920
 We do the law because it comes out of a place of grace,

392
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,320
 out of a place of love,

393
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,440
 out of an intimate relationship we have with God.

394
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,140
 Remember, Moses comes into God's presence

395
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,460
 and God speaks to him about how he should live.

396
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,560
 In fact, Jesus Himself said this.

397
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,160
 He says, "If you love me, you'll obey my commandments."

398
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,740
 He doesn't say, "If you obey my commandments,

399
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,360
 "I will love you."

400
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,040
 He doesn't say, "If you obey my commandments,

401
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,920
 "I can tell that you love me."

402
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,720
 He's saying, "If you love me."

403
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,280
 If we're in a relationship together,

404
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,960
 if there's this relationship of love that we have together,

405
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,880
 out of that will flow a new way that you'll want to live.

406
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,560
 You'll wanna do things that honor me.

407
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
 You'll wanna do things that connect

408
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,560
 the world and me together.

409
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,080
 You're gonna wanna live that character

410
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,480
 of the kingdom of priests and as a holy nation.

411
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,820
 Those things will naturally desire to come from you

412
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,280
 because they come from a place of love.

413
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,240
 This is why it was great in worship

414
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,880
 that we spent that time in that place

415
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,360
 of understanding our love of God and His love of us

416
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,280
 'cause from that flows everything we're about to do.

417
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,640
 And there's many of us who think

418
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,840
 if we can just do this list better, God will love us more.

419
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,280
 And I wanna break that slavery from you.

420
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,680
 Anybody here?

421
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,560
 I wanna break that slavery from you.

422
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,300
 You've been set free by Christ Jesus

423
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,840
 'cause He loves you so much.

424
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,440
 And out of that love comes the glory of life.

425
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,240
 Here's the third thing that the 10 commandments are not.

426
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,400
 They're not irrelevant for today.

427
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,040
 They're not to be cast aside.

428
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,800
 Oh, that was God in the Old Testament.

429
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,280
 And now that we have Christ

430
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,920
 and now that we are a kind of a regeneration,

431
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,240
 I have new covenant and this old stuff,

432
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,480
 it doesn't really matter anymore.

433
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,520
 I can live how I want because I have the grace of Jesus

434
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,680
 and He forgives me.

435
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,620
 That's not what's happening here.

436
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,640
 In fact, Jesus in His own ministry, He said this,

437
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,560
 "I didn't come to abolish the law.

438
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
 "I didn't come to wipe it away.

439
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,740
 "I didn't come to just say,

440
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,760
 "Hey, this doesn't matter anymore.

441
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,960
 "No, I've actually come to fulfill it.

442
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,800
 "I've actually come to show you in my life

443
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,980
 "how it is actually a blessing.

444
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,000
 "I wanna show you what the law does

445
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,320
 "and the heart behind the law.

446
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,440
 "And I wanna show you how I am the only one

447
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,040
 "who could ever fulfill the law."

448
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,000
 This is the fascinating thing.

449
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,120
 You see, the law itself was always designed

450
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,040
 to move people to Jesus.

451
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,960
 And so when Jesus says, "I am the fulfillment of the law,"

452
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,160
 what He's saying is the law is designed to draw you to me

453
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,960
 so that when you find me, you can then live out the law.

454
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,260
 Are you seeing the flow?

455
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,240
 So let me tell you a little bit

456
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,680
 about what the commandments actually are

457
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,920
 and how you might be able to live them out.

458
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,640
 And I wanna do that by breaking them down for you

459
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,520
 in a way that perhaps you've not heard before.

460
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,240
 But I hope in doing this,

461
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,840
 it'll really help you to understand

462
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,280
 how God has created you to be.

463
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,600
 Most people, when they look at the law,

464
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,840
 most scholars, when they talk about it,

465
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,760
 they break it into two sections.

466
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,960
 The first four being about our relationship with God

467
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,080
 and the next six being about our relationship

468
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,920
 with one another.

469
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,120
 And that's absolutely a fair way of looking at these.

470
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
 In fact, Jesus Himself pretty much saw it that way

471
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
 when the lawyer asked Him in the Gospels,

472
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,080
 "Hey, how do you summarize the law?"

473
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,160
 He says, "Love the Lord your God

474
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,760
 "with all your mind, heart, soul, and strength

475
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,060
 "and love your neighbor as yourself."

476
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,840
 There it is, the Shema, as it's known in the Torah

477
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,600
 in the Jewish faith.

478
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,000
 The Shema points us to the culmination of the law.

479
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
 We are to love God and out of that,

480
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,920
 we are to love one another.

481
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,560
 So it breaks quite neatly down

482
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,260
 into this kind of two sections.

483
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,360
 But I think what's really important to understand

484
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,640
 for the Jewish people as they've arrived at Mount Sinai,

485
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,760
 their context is not necessarily this kind of idea

486
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,840
 of the Shema, of pulling it all together in two easy ways.

487
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,840
 Their concept is still slavery and brokenness.

488
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,920
 And their concept is identity vacuum.

489
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,640
 And I need to know who I am.

490
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,600
 And it is the context of Egypt and slavery

491
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,160
 that God brings the law into that.

492
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,480
 So I think actually the 10 commandments

493
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,760
 break down into three sections

494
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,360
 that are all about how we love.

495
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
 'Cause God is calling His people now to live in a new way,

496
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
 to live in a place of love,

497
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,360
 not a place of slavery and fear.

498
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,560
 The first three are about how we love God.

499
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,800
 The fourth is about how we are to love ourselves.

500
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,360
 And the final six then are about

501
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,800
 how we are to love one another.

502
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,440
 And they flow in that order really well.

503
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,360
 Now, as I unpack these for us,

504
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,480
 I also wanna do it in three specific categories

505
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,400
 to help you to understand the heart behind

506
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
 what the 10 commandments are all about.

507
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,080
 I wanna talk to you about three identities

508
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,380
 because that's what God is trying to communicate.

509
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,880
 The first identity is what I'm calling Pharaoh's identity.

510
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
 I'm not speaking specifically about Pharaoh,

511
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
 the actual person and his identity.

512
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,180
 I'm talking about a summary identity,

513
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,740
 this idea of what humanity is like

514
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,600
 in its brokenness and sin.

515
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,640
 What we see in the whole of the Exodus journey

516
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,920
 is Pharaoh becoming this kind of picture,

517
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,400
 this metaphor, if you will,

518
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,720
 of what humanity is like apart from God,

519
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,200
 what humanity acts like

520
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,440
 when it isn't in relationship with God.

521
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
 So that's Pharaoh's identity.

522
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,080
 Does that make sense to you?

523
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,240
 Then I'm gonna tell you about God's identity,

524
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
 how God reveals Himself in the 10 commandments.

525
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,160
 And then finally, I'm gonna tell you about your identity,

526
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,800
 our identity, how that relates.

527
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,460
 So there's gonna be the identity

528
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,220
 of broken, sinful humanity,

529
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,680
 the identity of God, and then our identity.

530
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,860
 Making sense?

531
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,940
 Okay, let me give you some examples.

532
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,900
 Let's start with the very first one.

533
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,260
 The very first one is, of course, when God says,

534
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,460
 "You will have no other God than Me."

535
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,700
 No other God but Me.

536
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,660
 It's very important that that's the first one

537
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,640
 because, of course, Israel's come out of a pantheon

538
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,720
 of religious understanding when they were slaves.

539
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,420
 The Egyptian cultural religion had over 60 different gods.

540
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,740
 So God says, "No, we're leaving that behind.

541
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,060
 "That's not the way things are.

542
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,480
 "There is just one God, and you are to worship God.

543
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,440
 "You worship Me.

544
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,540
 "You're not to have any other gods."

545
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,280
 But actually, God is saying something else

546
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,780
 about identity here that's really important.

547
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,340
 It's easy to miss this.

548
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,020
 Remember, the context is slavery

549
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,540
 and coming out of that Pharaoh identity.

550
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,640
 The reality is, so much for many of us,

551
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,100
 is that we actually put ourselves in the place of God.

552
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,100
 It is so easy to make life all about yourself.

553
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,260
 It's so easy for us to begin to think

554
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,500
 that actually we are the center of the world.

555
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,180
 I remember raising my daughter.

556
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,060
 There were many years where everything revolved around Mia.

557
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,480
 Now I'm still wrapped around her finger

558
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,980
 a little bit too much, but she still knows now

559
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,560
 that the world does not revolve around her.

560
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,840
 Are you with me?

561
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,540
 But there is something in our identity,

562
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,420
 in Pharaoh's identity, where we would basically express it

563
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,980
 like this, "I am God, and I rule."

564
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,820
 And I want you to be honest with yourself

565
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,760
 'cause you'll hear that, and you'll be like,

566
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,320
 "No, no, I don't believe that."

567
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,280
 But then our actions, Monday to Friday,

568
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,400
 suggest that we are God and we rule.

569
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,420
 Are you with me?

570
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,780
 Am I preaching to anyone?

571
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,180
 Getting a little uncomfortable?

572
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,860
 Good, I'm just warming up.

573
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,900
 But the Pharaoh identity of this idea,

574
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,700
 "I am God, and I am rule,"

575
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,500
 and there's so much of that in us,

576
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,920
 and God knows He needs to break that.

577
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,000
 So God, with His first commandment, is saying,

578
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,880
 "I am God alone.

579
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,500
 "It is just me.

580
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,660
 "I am the only one.

581
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,100
 "I have all authority in my hands,

582
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,440
 "all control and authority sits me."

583
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,720
 Because when we declare that we are God and we rule,

584
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,340
 we're basically saying we're in control.

585
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,500
 God's saying, "All authority is in me."

586
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,100
 Our response to that then,

587
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,020
 our identity now as free people,

588
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,620
 is to say, "We are worshipers.

589
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,020
 "We are worshipers of God."

590
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,860
 And that's really important

591
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,980
 because when you're in that Pharaoh's space

592
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,500
 of saying, "I am God and I rule," you worship yourself.

593
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,700
 And God is saying, "I'm the one who holds all authority."

594
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,300
 Our response is to say, "I will worship God."

595
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,700
 Are you with me?

596
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,260
 Here's the second one.

597
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,100
 The second one is you will make no image.

598
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,540
 You will make no other idol.

599
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,660
 Now, this is really important again

600
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,340
 because they've come out of their slavery

601
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,420
 and out of that pantheon of 60 gods,

602
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,940
 there's lots of idols that are created

603
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,980
 that they can worship.

604
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,820
 And here's the fascinating thing.

605
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,940
 Pharaoh would use those idols as a way of controlling

606
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,580
 and manipulating his people.

607
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,700
 He would oppress them under a system of image worship,

608
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,620
 idol worship.

609
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,420
 And this is really important to understand

610
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,180
 because I think all of us struggle to some degree

611
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,420
 with a deep-seated Pharaoh identity

612
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,740
 of basically worship my image.

613
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,380
 Now I'm really preaching.

614
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,060
 Worship my image.

615
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,180
 Follow my social media.

616
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
 Follow my ideas.

617
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,060
 Do what I say.

618
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,380
 I wanna control.

619
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,660
 I wanna influence.

620
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,820
 I wanna be the focus.

621
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,420
 Worship my image.

622
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,340
 One of the things that we're seeing

623
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,620
 in the social media space right now

624
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,700
 is all these apps and all these AI tools

625
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,060
 that can take a really not attractive person

626
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,900
 and turn them into a stunning person.

627
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,100
 You no longer had to be like incredibly hot.

628
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,220
 You could be ugly and still hot today.

629
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,980
 And all of this is creating for us

630
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,020
 this idea of like worship my image.

631
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,860
 And God is saying, "Hang on,

632
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,460
 we need to break the back of that slavery."

633
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,660
 And he's saying, "You have me."

634
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,340
 He's basically saying, "I am all you need.

635
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,180
 And if you have me,

636
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,580
 you don't need to worship anything else,

637
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,980
 whether that's anything in the world

638
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
 or whether that's yourself, you have me."

639
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,580
 Our response to that is to say,

640
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,260
 "My identity therefore is I am undivided."

641
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,660
 Because one thing that image worship always does,

642
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,740
 it divides your heart.

643
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,660
 And you end up worshiping a whole bunch

644
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,780
 of different things all over the place.

645
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,420
 Pharaoh's identity is come and worship me, I'm the best.

646
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,060
 God is saying, "You don't need anything else other than me."

647
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,780
 We're going, "I am undivided in my heart."

648
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,980
 Are you seeing this still so far?

649
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,020
 Anyone?

650
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,420
 Are you alive?

651
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,500
 Okay, here's the third one.

652
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,740
 By the way, we're not doing this for all 10, don't worry.

653
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,700
 This would be about a four hour sermon.

654
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,300
 But I'm gonna do it for a few.

655
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,660
 The third one is this idea of not misusing my name.

656
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,540
 He says, "Don't misuse my name."

657
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,020
 When I grew up, I thought this was all about swearing.

658
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,900
 Don't swear.

659
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,540
 If somebody beats you to the lift and the door's closed,

660
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,740
 don't use Jesus's name out loud, right?

661
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,060
 Now, that is very important.

662
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,980
 And please don't misuse God's name in that context.

663
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,500
 But I don't think that's actually what God is saying here

664
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,420
 in this moment.

665
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,940
 He's drawing his people to him out of a place of slavery.

666
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,700
 And he's saying, "I've saved you.

667
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,980
 "I have redeemed you.

668
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,060
 "I have set you free.

669
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,860
 "Now don't misuse my name."

670
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,380
 Name in biblical context means character,

671
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,340
 your good name, my character.

672
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,620
 He's saying, "Don't misuse my character."

673
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:44,420
 In other words, if you're gonna say that you're a Christian,

674
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,420
 but your life is leading a very different picture

675
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,100
 to my character and who I am, stop doing that.

676
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,140
 Don't misuse my name.

677
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,340
 Don't claim to be a Christ follower

678
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,660
 and do all this other stuff that everybody else is doing,

679
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,300
 because that's just not gonna do any priestly function

680
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,140
 in the world at all.

681
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,860
 You're not helping people connect God together.

682
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,300
 People just think you're just like them.

683
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,980
 Don't misuse my name.

684
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,220
 Are you with me?

685
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,860
 And then there's this other thought as well

686
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,780
 that I think is in God's heart here.

687
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,300
 And that is for us as Christians amongst each other.

688
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,500
 Because I tell you one of the things that's at work

689
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,020
 in the global church right now

690
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,300
 that we have to be really, really careful of,

691
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,220
 and we need to stand up against is spiritual abuse.

692
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,020
 And spiritual abuse happens when somebody takes

693
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,500
 God's authority to manipulate people

694
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,300
 within a church context.

695
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,100
 The number one, I'm just gonna be honest with you.

696
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,940
 The number one thing that Chris and I constantly pray about

697
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,580
 is that I would do my utmost to avoid the temptation

698
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,980
 to use God's name to get you

699
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,500
 to do something I want you to do.

700
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:53,220
 That's every pastor's greatest challenge.

701
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
 But it's not just the pastor's challenge.

702
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,580
 It's also your challenge too.

703
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,500
 That we wouldn't misuse the name of God

704
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,740
 for our own personal gain.

705
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,940
 Pharaoh's identity is basically this, God serves me.

706
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,700
 Like I'm gonna use God to get what I need to get.

707
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,660
 God serves me.

708
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,740
 God is basically saying, I serve no one.

709
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,860
 Our response is to say, we are servants.

710
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,500
 We are servants of God.

711
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,860
 You follow the flow?

712
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,700
 So I want you to see what God's doing

713
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
 just in this first section of loving God.

714
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,660
 He's trying to uproot some of this broken Pharaoh identity

715
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,300
 that so many of us still hold onto,

716
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,260
 that I know I still hold onto,

717
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,900
 where I say, I am God and I rule.

718
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,180
 Where I say, worship my image.

719
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,980
 Where I say, God serves me.

720
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,300
 God says, I alone have all that authority.

721
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,900
 You don't need anything else other than me.

722
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,460
 And I serve no one.

723
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,020
 And our response then in the reality of that

724
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,900
 as free people is to say, I am a worshiper.

725
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,100
 I am undivided.

726
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,540
 I serve God.

727
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,620
 Follow it?

728
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,940
 Isn't it great?

729
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,900
 This is the path to life.

730
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,860
 This is not shackles to bind you.

731
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,700
 It is something to set you free.

732
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,580
 This is why the fourth one is the most, I think, important.

733
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,660
 Keep the Sabbath.

734
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,740
 Keep the Sabbath.

735
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,740
 Have a day off, God says, and we all ignore it.

736
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,340
 And he binds this in creative history.

737
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,700
 He says, in the same way that God himself

738
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,460
 rested on the seventh day, you should also rest.

739
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,340
 And God is not doing this

740
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,820
 because he thinks everybody needs a yoga retreat.

741
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,300
 He's doing this because he's speaking about their identity.

742
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,260
 Notice this, when you're a slave,

743
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:44,980
 you are never resting or free to rest.

744
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,380
 Slavery by its very definition is you go, go, go, go, go

745
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,220
 all the time.

746
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,500
 They work seven days, 365 days a year.

747
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,980
 That's what it meant to be a slave.

748
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,660
 So when God comes and he says,

749
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,500
 this is not about how you love me.

750
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,340
 This is also about how you love yourself.

751
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,580
 And if you don't rest, you are not proclaiming the freedom

752
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,980
 I have paid the price for for you.

753
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,060
 'Cause when you fail to rest,

754
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,140
 you're basically adapting the identity of a slave.

755
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,100
 This is why this is so key for Hong Kong.

756
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,500
 Because every single one of us, we all work too much.

757
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,220
 We all drive ourselves so much.

758
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,420
 That song we sang earlier, there's so many times

759
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,580
 where Chris says to me,

760
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,580
 "Even when I don't see it, you're still working.

761
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,700
 "Even when I don't feel it, you're still working.

762
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,740
 "You never stop, you never stop working."

763
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,260
 (congregation laughing)

764
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,100
 She's right.

765
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,740
 I need this more than anything.

766
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,220
 And here's what the identity is.

767
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,500
 The Pharaoh identity is, I will provide for myself.

768
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,220
 I will consume and provide.

769
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,820
 I'm in control.

770
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,900
 And we drive ourselves because we're fearful

771
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,140
 of not being able to provide.

772
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,100
 And God is saying, I'm your provider, rest.

773
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,500
 Take a breath.

774
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,820
 You can't do it all in your own strength.

775
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,180
 You can't drive yourself to success like that.

776
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,860
 You can try, but you're just gonna reach burnout.

777
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,700
 You need to rest.

778
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,700
 And in that place of rest, we say, I have faith in God.

779
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,980
 I have faith and I have trust in Him that He will provide.

780
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,820
 And that means that I will stop my work.

781
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,180
 I will turn my email off.

782
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,260
 I won't respond to WhatsApps or whatever it is.

783
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,340
 I'm gonna break away.

784
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,900
 I'm gonna spend time with my loved ones.

785
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,220
 I'm gonna get away from all of that stuff

786
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,700
 that's draining all my energy.

787
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,340
 I'm gonna refill it by being in relationship with God.

788
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,300
 And that's the way I'm gonna find life.

789
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,820
 That's the path to life for me.

790
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,180
 It's really interesting because we think Sabbath

791
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,100
 is about coming to a church service.

792
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,860
 Sabbath itself is worship.

793
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,020
 Come on church.

794
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,780
 I like it when you come to church services.

795
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,380
 Please keep coming to church services.

796
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,780
 But I need you to know that Sabbath itself is worship.

797
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,100
 Because when you Sabbath,

798
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,260
 you're saying I'm no longer a slave.

799
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,380
 I have freedom to rest.

800
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,620
 And when you rest,

801
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,100
 you proclaim a different narrative to the world.

802
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,140
 Rest my friends, rest.

803
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,740
 Now, here's the other important thing about Sabbath

804
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,340
 and why I think it's here, right here, number four,

805
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,820
 and why it's about ourselves.

806
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,060
 Because here's the reality.

807
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,700
 When we fail to rest, we're really bad at loving others.

808
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,700
 When you're exhausted and tired and worn out and burnout,

809
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,820
 your patience with people goes like this.

810
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
 At least mine does.

811
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,580
 I know when I need a Sabbath

812
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,460
 is when I don't like you guys anymore.

813
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,980
 (congregation laughing)

814
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,620
 That's when I need a break.

815
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,500
 That's when I need to get away.

816
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,540
 Because I love you guys.

817
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,780
 I really love you guys.

818
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,940
 But there are times when I don't,

819
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,500
 and that's because I've gone and I've gone

820
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
 and I've worked and I've worked

821
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,980
 and I'm exhausted and in pain.

822
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,820
 This is why God says you have to keep the Sabbath.

823
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,140
 And it's about loving yourself because out of that,

824
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,420
 then you can keep the next six.

825
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,300
 'Cause the next six are really hard if you're exhausted.

826
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,300
 The next six are really difficult if you have not rested.

827
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,900
 But if you're resting in me, abiding in me,

828
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,140
 finding your presence in me,

829
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,500
 then you will flow to your love of others.

830
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,260
 Now I'm not gonna break these down one by one for you

831
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,140
 'cause it will take ages, but let me put them up on a slide.

832
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,260
 This is the next six of them.

833
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,340
 You don't need to take a photo of this

834
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,700
 'cause I'm gonna give you one slide in a moment

835
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,580
 that I have all 10.

836
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,020
 So, but you can look at this.

837
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,780
 I want you to see this because here you see,

838
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,300
 God has a heart for family.

839
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,980
 God has a heart for people.

840
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,580
 God believes in life over death,

841
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,940
 that God is non-violent,

842
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,900
 that God wants us to treat each other with respect

843
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,940
 and honor and peace and love.

844
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,860
 This is a manifesto of how we should be walking together

845
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
 with one another.

846
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,420
 And yet that Pharaoh identity so easily strips us

847
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,880
 of the freedom that God has created us for.

848
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,220
 Are you with me?

849
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,100
 And all of this is his invitation.

850
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,220
 It's like, come to me and out of me,

851
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,300
 come and live this stuff.

852
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,820
 Now, if you're anything like me, let me put up all 10

853
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,660
 and you can take a quick photo of that.

854
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,260
 And we're actually gonna make a social media post

855
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,620
 about it later this week.

856
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,860
 So you can keep an eye out on our Instagram

857
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,140
 and Facebook for that.

858
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,300
 But you can take a photo of that.

859
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,340
 You can put it up somewhere where you can see it regularly

860
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,980
 because this is the path of life.

861
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,420
 Now, you're all taking a photo.

862
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,760
 (congregation laughing)

863
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,780
 Serious, I'm gonna finish with this.

864
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,260
 I don't know about you, but when I look at that list,

865
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,700
 my time is spent looking at Pharaoh's identity

866
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,020
 because I relate to it.

867
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,780
 I look in here and I can see so much of Pharaoh in me.

868
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,660
 I can see so much of the broken is still there in me.

869
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,360
 I can feel the temptation to make myself a God.

870
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,840
 I can feel the temptation to make people worship my image.

871
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,540
 I can feel the temptation to wanna steal

872
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,040
 other people's creative ideas.

873
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,140
 I can feel that brokenness in me to look with my eyes

874
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,660
 upon others in ways that I shouldn't.

875
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,700
 So much of Pharaoh I know still sits in me.

876
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,140
 And part of that is absolutely right

877
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,900
 because the law is to drive us to Jesus.

878
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,500
 And when we see this broken Pharaoh-ness in us,

879
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,920
 it should compel us, drive us towards Jesus.

880
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,820
 But here's what usually happens.

881
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,060
 When we find the Pharaoh stuff in us,

882
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,780
 it doesn't drive us to Jesus, it drives us to ourselves.

883
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,460
 And we try to work harder to achieve everything

884
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,420
 on the right hand side here in our own strength.

885
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,860
 The worst thing you can do off of a message like this

886
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,700
 is to go home and go,

887
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,500
 "Andrew told me to pull my socks up

888
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,260
 and try to be a better human being."

889
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,060
 It's not what I'm telling you today.

890
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,880
 If you try this in your own human strength,

891
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,100
 you will be exhausted.

892
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,180
 The most exhausting thing on earth

893
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,420
 is being religious and not saved.

894
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,660
 Oh, the most exhausting thing is being religious

895
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,280
 but not having a saving relationship with Jesus.

896
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,340
 You cannot achieve this on your own, in your own strength.

897
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,180
 And that's what the law is all about.

898
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,260
 The whole point of the law

899
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,980
 is to bring us to somebody who can do it.

900
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,620
 This is why Jesus said, "I didn't abolish it,

901
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,780
 but I fulfilled it."

902
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,300
 Paul writing in Romans 10, he put it this way.

903
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,980
 He said, "Christ is the culmination of the law

904
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,420
 so that there may be righteousness

905
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,380
 for everyone who believes."

906
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,820
 But notice this, who believes?

907
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,980
 Who has relationship?

908
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,200
 Who is in a relationship?

909
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,100
 Not righteousness for everybody who works hard,

910
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,020
 tries hard, strives hard, does stuff on their own strength.

911
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,860
 Righteousness for those who believe

912
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,980
 'cause Christ is the culmination of the law.

913
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,500
 And as the culmination of the law,

914
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,340
 our belief and relationship with him

915
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,700
 releases the law in and through us.

916
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,540
 This is why Paul would write

917
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,060
 that we no longer have the law on stones or tablet,

918
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,540
 but they're written on the flesh of our heart.

919
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,860
 'Cause the spirit of God now is in us

920
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,460
 to help us to live in the way that would bring God glory.

921
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,220
 We don't do it in our striving, we do it in our abiding.

922
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,740
 We do it in our relationship with Jesus.

923
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,420
 As we're drawn into him

924
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,340
 and intimately in relationship with him,

925
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,400
 we are then drawn out to the world.

926
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,280
 The last thing I want you to do

927
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,560
 is just try to work harder.

928
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,440
 What I wanna invite you into

929
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,720
 is to be so inspired by the path of life

930
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,220
 that you just wanna be more with Jesus.

931
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,840
 The very central passage of the vine is John 15, five.

932
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,720
 I am the vine, you are the branches.

933
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,560
 If a person remains in me and I in them,

934
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,060
 they will bear much fruit.

935
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,280
 Apart from me, you can do nothing.

936
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,040
 Apart from me, it is useless.

937
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,160
 It is just religion without salvation and that's painful.

938
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,080
 But in me and with me, it is the path of life.

939
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,440
 Abide in me, he says.

940
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,600
 Don't try to go through that list

941
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,000
 and make it all work for you.

942
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,940
 Use that list to propel you to Jesus

943
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,040
 so that in relationship with him,

944
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,140
 you are propelled to the world.

945
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,240
 That's the path of life.

946
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,900
 And that is Exodus chapter 20.

947
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
 Let me pray for you.

948
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,720
 Father, I am so grateful for everybody here.

949
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,640
 I'm so grateful for your presence with us

950
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,400
 and your call to us.

951
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,720
 Father, we sit in the beauty of these 10 commandments,

952
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,240
 these 10 words.

953
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,540
 And Father, they invite us into reflecting

954
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,060
 on our Pharaoh identities,

955
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,480
 on the brokenness that we carry so easily amongst us.

956
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,280
 And the law reveals the Pharaohs in us,

957
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,700
 not so that we would feel bad about ourselves,

958
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,660
 so that we'd feel alone in that field,

959
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,360
 so that we would beat ourselves up.

960
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,760
 The law reveals our brokenness

961
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,620
 so that we are drawn to Christ,

962
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,640
 that we are drawn out of ourselves to him,

963
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,140
 the one who can save,

964
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,080
 the only one who's the fulfillment,

965
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,180
 the culmination of the law.

966
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,980
 So Father, for every person here

967
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,240
 who is recognizing some of the Pharaohs in their identity,

968
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,020
 I pray that in this moment, they would come to you.

969
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,200
 I wanna give you space to be able to do that,

970
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,000
 just in the quietness of your heart.

971
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:35,540
 We've seen today God's identity,

972
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,940
 who he is, what he stands for,

973
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,300
 and the way that he is the opposite

974
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,640
 of all that slavery that we experience.

975
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,060
 And out of his identity and who he is

976
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,960
 and how he's made himself known, we then respond.

977
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,680
 And so I wanna pray for each one of you

978
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,220
 as you abide in Christ,

979
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,440
 as you come to Jesus in a beautiful place of grace,

980
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,860
 I pray that you would feel him transforming and changing you

981
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,500
 as a priest and as someone who is holy.

982
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,640
 And I feel that out of that, I pray that you would know

983
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,600
 the joy that it is to live in this world

984
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,920
 in a way where we love our neighbor,

985
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,640
 where we don't commit adultery, where we don't fight,

986
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,020
 where we don't seek brokenness and slavery,

987
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,440
 but a world where we long to love and honor and respect

988
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,680
 and see peace come on earth as it is in heaven.

989
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,920
 Father, would you inspire us by you

990
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,760
 and by how you are all of the law

991
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,880
 in a person and in your spirit.

992
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,840
 So I wanna pray for the release of the Holy Spirit

993
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,940
 of every person here.

994
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,880
 I wanna pray, Lord, that you would,

995
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,880
 by your spirit, write on our hearts your path of life.

996
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,640
 In Jesus' name we pray.

997
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,960
 I'm just gonna respond together in worship.

998
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,200
 Would you stand with me?
