[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:14.480]   The Father would remind you this morning
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.480]   that His mighty right arm,
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.580]   His mighty right arm is stretched out towards you.
[00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.360]   Always is a symbol of strength, of victory.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.360]   It's the arm that a warrior would have the sword in.
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720]   And the Lord is saying,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.580]   "I see the need that you have at this time."
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.880]   And I feel like for many of us in this room,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.400]   it's an emotional need.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.240]   And the Father would say,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.920]   "My mighty right arm is extended towards you now."
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.680]   And there's this beautiful moment in Nehemiah
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.900]   as he's rebuilding the wall
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.640]   and he's come under such attack from those
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.200]   that were trying to resist the rebuilding
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.500]   of the walls of Jerusalem.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.560]   In chapter six, Nehemiah turns to the Father
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280]   and he says, "Lord, strengthen my hands."
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.920]   And I feel just in the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.140]   for you here this morning, that that's a prayer for you.
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.920]   And so if your hands are open
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.500]   and if you're in need of the mighty right arm of God
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.540]   to do battle for you,
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.180]   I wonder whether you would just pray that prayer
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.680]   in your heart now.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.540]   Lord, strengthen my hands, strengthen my heart,
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.900]   strengthen my mind, strengthen my emotions,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.660]   strengthen my relationships, strengthen my business,
[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.220]   strengthen the things that I don't have the ability
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.680]   to strengthen, Father, would you strengthen me?
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.640]   Father, you've put a task,
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.520]   you've put something before each one of us,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.280]   just like you put before Nehemiah a noble task.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.600]   And Lord, I wanna pray for anybody in this room
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960]   that's wanting to shrink back,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.800]   that perhaps opposition or perhaps word spoken
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.040]   or perhaps resistance is causing people in this room
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.560]   to wanna put the tools down
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920]   and to give up on the building that God has called you to do.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   We just say in the name of Jesus over you,
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.780]   that the Father's mighty right arm is here to save,
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.720]   it's here to move on your behalf,
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.880]   and he will strengthen you for the resilience
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   and the hope and the life that he wants to fill you in.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.960]   The Lord would say, I see you.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.200]   I see you, the wholeness of you.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.260]   I see your coming and your going.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.220]   You have nothing to fear, for you are in my gaze.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.920]   My light shines upon you.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.300]   You have nothing to fear.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.640]   So as I called to Joshua, so I called you,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.200]   be strong and courageous.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.880]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.060]   Allow my spirit to fill you, to strengthen your hands.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.800]   Do not give up, for it is your time to rise.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.660]   It is your time to wake.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.100]   It is your time to move.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.560]   Don't hold back.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.620]   For the same spirit, the Bible says,
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.420]   that raised Christ from the dead is now in you.
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.460]   And so I wanna pray that you would feel
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.260]   as we open God's word together here this morning,
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.320]   you would feel the calling of Christ upon you again.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.200]   For those of you that have been feeling weak,
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.340]   you will feel strong.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.380]   For those that have been overwhelmed, you'll be comforted.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.660]   For those that have felt to shrink back in this season,
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.400]   you will feel the Holy Spirit's wind behind your back.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.820]   Lord, I pray for a releasing of your people
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.020]   as we open your word together here this morning.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.800]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.720]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.080]   We thank you for this, Lord.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.320]   And to you be the glory, we pray, in Jesus' name.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.520]   Everyone says, amen, amen.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.200]   Hey, can we thank our worship team?
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.700]   (congregation applauding)
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.880]   Well, welcome to the Vine.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.600]   If this is your relative first time with us,
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.480]   we're so glad you're here.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320]   And we know that we got a full overflow as well.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.520]   Outside and people joining us online from around the world.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.480]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.720]   And isn't it wonderful to be in a crazy city like Hong Kong
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   and just have a moment where we can go,
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.520]   just me, just me?
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.360]   Thank you.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.080]   Or we can just take the foot off the gas for a moment
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.800]   and just kind of go, thank you, Lord.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.080]   Thanks for being with us.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.880]   I wonder if you've ever experienced
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.080]   the absolute blackness of the darkness of night.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.920]   I wonder if you've ever been in a situation
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.760]   where you've been in the complete darkness of an evening
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.640]   or a complete darkness of a night.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.960]   If you're anything like me and you grew up here in Hong Kong
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.360]   then chances are you haven't.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.760]   Because we live in a city, don't we, that's 24/7?
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.600]   A city that is filled with the ambient neon light pollution
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.760]   that it is.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.640]   Whenever we go to bed at night,
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.720]   we may draw the curtains and turn off the lights
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.880]   in our house, but it feels like there's this other big light
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.800]   glowing out there.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.000]   And I grew up in this city
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.320]   and I've always had ambient light around me always.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.680]   And I've never really known the trueness
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.840]   of what darkness is like.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.880]   I've just gotten used to sleeping with the glow of a city
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   that is 24/7, that never sleeps.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.080]   But this all changed when my wife invited me
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.440]   to come and visit her and her family
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.760]   in their small little town in New Zealand.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.200]   New Zealand that doesn't have any neon lights.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.760]   And I remember that first night I had gone to bed,
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.360]   I was exhausted, I mean, traveled down and was tired.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.160]   And I got into bed and I had a little side lamp on
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.280]   and I was reading my book,
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.800]   but I couldn't read for very long, I was super tired,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.000]   put the book down.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.040]   I turned the light out and I freaked out.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.320]   Because for the first time,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.840]   literally probably the first time in my life,
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.640]   I was finally in a place
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.000]   where there was no light pollution at all.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.760]   And suddenly I was in darkness, like complete darkness.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.560]   It was like, (screams)
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.840]   like I really didn't like it, it filled me with fear.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.200]   There was actually no difference in that room
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.640]   as I'm lying in that bed
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.320]   between having my eyes open or my eyes closed.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.120]   It was completely black either way.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.920]   I remember lying there,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.080]   putting my hand in front of my face like this
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.760]   just to make sure I still had limbs on me.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.280]   'Cause I could not literally see my hand
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.480]   right in front of my face.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.240]   And I remember lying there thinking,
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.200]   I'm glad I'm here visiting my beautiful wife and her family,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.320]   but I can't sleep in darkness.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.720]   It's like I needed like some ambient light somewhere
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.200]   to kind of lull me into a place of being able to sleep.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.760]   The darkness was total and the darkness was uncomfortable.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.640]   I needed some light.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.640]   As Paul continues this incredible letter
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.520]   to the church in Ephesus that we've been going through
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.360]   as a church over the last number of weeks,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.640]   he comes to a section of it, chapters five and six,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.760]   where he has some of the strongest things
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.120]   that he wants to say to his church community.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.080]   Stuff that's actually gonna be kind of difficult
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.520]   for them to hear.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.920]   Stuff that's gonna shake up a few things amongst them
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.120]   and stuff that's gonna sober them
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.400]   in terms of how they think about church
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.760]   and life and community.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.160]   And Paul's doing this off the back
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.560]   of what Pastor Tim shared with us last week
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.760]   about this idea of taking off the old self,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   which is being corrupted by a deceit
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.320]   and our deceitful desires and putting on the new self
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.640]   that is filled with freedom and love
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.080]   and the glory of God and holiness.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.120]   And Paul's just taught them,
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.360]   look, I want you to take off the old stuff,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.440]   put on the new stuff.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.160]   And then from chapters five and six,
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.840]   he basically unpacks what it is
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.640]   that he wants them to take off
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.920]   and what it is that they can now put on.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.720]   And the passage that we're looking at here this morning,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.120]   I think is perhaps the hardest things
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.360]   that he has to say to his church.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.200]   He's got some pretty tough stuff to say to them
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.680]   in these verses that we're looking at.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.800]   But everything we've seen of Paul so far in this letter
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.320]   is important for us to remember.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.160]   Paul has an incredible pastoral heart.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.800]   I mean, he loves the people of his church so much.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.360]   We've seen this throughout the letter, haven't we?
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.120]   He's just spent three chapters, chapters one to three,
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.920]   unpacking Christ and what Christ has done
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.800]   and the grace that Christ has done
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.200]   to pay the price for our sins
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.000]   and to bring us into new life.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.400]   He's then at the end of chapter three,
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.520]   prayed that beautiful prayer of love.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.160]   Oh, church, I wish that you would be strengthened
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.560]   from within you with the power of the Spirit,
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.640]   that you would know the height, depth, and width
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.080]   and the length of love,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.960]   that love that surpasses understanding
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.320]   would be inside of you.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.760]   He said, I want you to know love.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.560]   And then he started chapter four with,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.080]   hey, I want you to now live a life that's worthy
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.680]   of all the things that we've just talked about
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.200]   in the first three chapters.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.600]   And I want you as a church body,
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.040]   as a Christian community to find unity together
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.880]   in the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.760]   He's just poured all that out.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.520]   And now he's getting to the point
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.280]   where really the rubber hits the road.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.400]   And he's saying to the church,
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.600]   but there's still this going on inside of you.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.120]   Despite all the stuff that we've seen,
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.800]   there's still this, but his pastoral heart is like,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.560]   how do I explain this in a way
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.960]   that number one, sobers you
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.000]   and helps you to understand the sin
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.200]   that is still at work in you
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.480]   and leads you to deal with that,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.960]   but equally inspire you,
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.480]   lift you up so that you're living better.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.240]   You're desiring to live in a way
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.320]   that you're not currently living.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.400]   He's like, how do I do this?
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.680]   Sober you, inspire you.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.280]   And so here's what he decides to do.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   He decides to dig into the rich history,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.360]   biblical history of the metaphor of darkness and light
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.680]   in order to help his church to understand
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.040]   how they need to take off.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.200]   But actually Christ has already done
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.080]   and placed upon them so much.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.880]   And as I unpack this metaphor that Paul brings us
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.800]   of darkness and light with you today, here's my prayer.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   I feel in my spirit that many of us here, myself included,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.880]   where it doesn't make a difference
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.720]   whether our eyes are open or our eyes are closed,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.880]   we're still seeing darkness.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.320]   We're really struggling to see the future for ourselves.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.720]   We're struggling perhaps to see the future for our city.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.160]   We're struggling perhaps to see anything good at all.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.320]   And when we look around the world, we see so much darkness
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.960]   and it's almost like there's a hand in front of us,
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.840]   but we cannot see it.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.680]   Some of you right now are currently
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.400]   in a posture of blindness.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.200]   And my prayer as we open up these passages today
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.360]   is that something would click for you.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.680]   Something would shift in your spirit
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.200]   and you would go from darkness to light.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.000]   Let me read this to you from Ephesians 5,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.280]   starting in verse three.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   Listen to these strong words of the Apostle Paul,
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.000]   but from a pastoral heart for his church.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.160]   He says, "But among you, there must not even be a hint
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.080]   of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity or of greed
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.880]   because these are improper for God's people.
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.360]   Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.920]   or coarse joking, which are out of place,
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.040]   but rather thanksgiving.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.160]   For of this you can be sure, no immoral, impure
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.320]   or greedy person, such a person as an idolater,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.800]   has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.480]   So let no one deceive you with empty words.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.360]   And because of such things, God's wrath comes
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.320]   on those who are disobedient.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.840]   For you were once darkness,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.200]   but now you are light in the Lord.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.200]   So live as children of light,
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.400]   for the fruit of light consists in all goodness
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.760]   and justice and truth.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.840]   And so find out what pleases the Lord.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.360]   Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness,
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.640]   but rather expose them.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.600]   For it is shameful to even mention
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.400]   what the disobedient do in secret,
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.440]   but everything exposed by the light becomes visible
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.040]   and everything illuminated becomes a light."
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.640]   This is why it says, "Wake up, O sleeper,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.480]   rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you."
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.560]   So be very careful then how you live,
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.240]   not as unwise, but as wise,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.480]   making the most of every opportunity
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.360]   because the days are dark, they are evil.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.840]   It's really majestic what Paul does here.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.560]   He's not trying to win friends.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.440]   He's trying to be really honest
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.760]   and direct with his community.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.720]   And there's this beautiful flow in what he's teaching here.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.600]   He starts out by addressing some of that deep stuff
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.240]   that he can see still at work with his people,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.000]   but then he moves them to think about this metaphor
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.080]   of darkness and light.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.040]   And in that, he calls them to now live in a new way,
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.280]   to live, and I love this phrase, as children of light.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.400]   So he's got some strong things to say
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.040]   about the sin and their brokenness,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.000]   but he's speaking to them as children
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.880]   and he's giving them a new perspective
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.480]   on how they can now live their lives.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.400]   I wanna take you through this flow
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.680]   and hopefully as we do so,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.600]   something will speak into your soul here.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.960]   Notice the sin list that he provides.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.640]   It's not an exhaustive list,
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.000]   but I think he's chosen specific sins
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.760]   that were relevant for this particular community.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.600]   Things like the sexual immorality, the greed,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.080]   there's a whole bunch of them that I've highlighted
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.680]   on the screen there for you to see.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.160]   What I want you to see most importantly
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.000]   is that Paul is talking about not just general things.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.320]   Hey, don't do these things.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.040]   He's saying, these things are at work within you
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.200]   and I'm pointing them out for one very important reason.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.640]   These particular sins that he's highlighting,
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.440]   that he sees at work in his body,
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.880]   these sins, he's saying basically,
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.280]   are sins that don't just break your relationship
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.720]   with your father, with God,
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.680]   but it also breaks your relationship with one another.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.880]   Every single one of these is about breaking that community
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.120]   that he's just prayed for them
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.920]   at the end of chapter three that they would have
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.600]   and he should have said at the beginning of chapter four
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.120]   that unity that they can find
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.680]   in the knowledge and the faith of God.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.320]   These things he's saying breaks everything
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.560]   that we've been talking about in the letter so far.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.240]   Every single one of these are basically selfish acts
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.720]   that you do at the expense of the other.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.320]   The sexually immoral,
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.480]   those that are sexually in immorality, he says,
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.000]   what you're doing is you're seeking pleasure for yourself
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   even at the expense of the people around you.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.520]   He talks about greed.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.800]   Greed by its very definition is the hoarding of resources
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.280]   so that you gain, again, at the expense of the other.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.080]   He talks about harsh language, coarse joking.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.520]   Again, it's all around this idea
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.360]   of we shouldn't be slandering each other.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.200]   We shouldn't be gossiping about each other.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.040]   We shouldn't be making fun of one another.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.320]   That just breaks disunity, but God's called us to unity.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.080]   Do you see this?
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.480]   And the reason why this is important
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.880]   is because he actually does something
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.760]   incredibly theological.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.240]   Let me show you this from verse five.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.400]   He says, "For this you can be sure,
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.720]   no immoral, impure, or greedy person,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.160]   such a person is an idolater,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.840]   has an inheritance in the kingdom of God
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.080]   or the kingdom of Christ."
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.920]   It's really important you see something here.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.040]   Paul says, look, when you're doing sins,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.360]   that breaks the unity and community
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.440]   that you can have as the body,
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.120]   here's ultimately what you're doing.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.120]   You're doing idolatry,
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.800]   and it's idolatry not worshiping other gods.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.160]   It's idolatry making yourself God.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.920]   Come on, church, this is super important
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   that you track with this.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.280]   'Cause what he's saying, something that's very deep here,
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.640]   this is the original sin that happened in the garden.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.280]   If you go back to Genesis chapter three,
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.480]   and you see Adam and Eve there,
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.080]   and you see Satan coming in that form of the snake
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.760]   and speaking to Adam and Eve,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.320]   he basically says this, Satan, he said,
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.920]   God told you not to eat of this fruit.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.440]   Well, that's because God doesn't want you
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.320]   to become like him.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.760]   But if you eat of that fruit, you'll become like him,
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   knowing good and evil.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.360]   And Adam and Eve take the fruit
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.640]   because they've decided, here's the temptation,
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.360]   they've decided they're not comfortable anymore
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   being made in the image of God, Genesis one and two.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.800]   They now want to be like God.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.960]   They wanna be equal to God.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.760]   So at the heart of the very first sin
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.120]   is this desire to be a peer with God.
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.840]   And what Paul is saying is that the ultimate purpose
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.360]   of all sin is to exchange your identity
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.480]   from being a child of God to trying to be a peer with God.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.800]   That's ultimately what all sin does.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.000]   It's trying to shift you away from your right relationship
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.440]   with your father in heaven and cause you to think
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.480]   that you can be on the same level.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.960]   So when we place ourselves at the center of our world
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.680]   through whatever acts we might do in order to do that,
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.320]   we become greedy.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.360]   When we say my pleasure is more important
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.560]   than anyone else's.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.680]   What Paul's saying is you're idle worshiping yourself
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.920]   and that is the roots of all sin.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.200]   And when you do that,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.000]   you're breaking the unity amongst yourselves.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.560]   Are you tracking with this?
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.320]   This is why he uses the word in verse five,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.120]   the word inheritance.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.960]   He says, if you live that way, if you act that way,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   you will lose the inheritance that you have in Christ Jesus.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.240]   You have no inheritance.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.520]   Now that's a very interesting word he uses here.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.840]   He uses this word on purpose because notice it,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.520]   if your original perspective and relationship
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.640]   and identity is a child, so you're here,
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.080]   you're a child of God.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.720]   And if sin causes you to try to become a peer of God,
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.880]   what he's saying is you no longer see yourself
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.840]   as his family.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.240]   You never see yourself anymore as a son and daughter.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.200]   You think you're equal with him.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.600]   Well, you're gonna lose your inheritance
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.200]   because inheritance is a family thing, isn't it?
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.520]   Inheritance happens when you're within a family.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.760]   And he's saying, look, you've decided through your sin,
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.200]   through the way you're acting to try to be a peer of God.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.920]   So you're gonna lose out on your inheritance.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.000]   And Paul is crying out to his church,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.880]   don't lose the inheritance that Christ has paid
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.960]   an incredible price for on the cross.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.480]   Your salvation, your hope, your forgiveness,
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.480]   your mercy, your grace, your flourishing, your shalom,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.600]   be made now into his image
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.120]   so that you can become the fullness of him,
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.120]   as he's just said in chapter four,
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.720]   the wholeness of the fullness of Christ.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.560]   He's like, you'll lose all of that
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.520]   if you think you're no longer part of God's family,
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.000]   but you wanna try to be God himself.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.920]   And he's like, that is not the way to go.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.760]   And as Paul's unpacking this,
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.680]   he's inviting his church to shift something within them,
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.760]   just to say, I don't want to lose my identity
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.560]   as a child of God.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.160]   That is the primary thing,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.360]   because in that perspective of being a child,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.080]   it is not me-centered, it is other-centered.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.080]   Christ, first and foremost, I submit myself to him.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.360]   And Paul said, that's how we flourish.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.720]   That's our inheritance in the kingdom of Christ.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.320]   And as your pastor here,
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.080]   I wanna pick up a little bit of Paul's pastoral heart
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.560]   for his community in Ephesus.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.920]   And I wanna say over you,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.600]   I do not want you to lose the inheritance
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   that you have in Christ.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.560]   And so here's what I implore of you.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.120]   Enjoy the role of repentance.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.800]   When we think about repentance in the church,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.400]   so often we make it such a heavy topic.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.120]   We make it such a weighty thing.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.680]   We make it such a like, oh my gosh,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.120]   I've gotta confess and repent.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.680]   And Paul's saying, you should find joy,
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.400]   joy in coming before Christ and offering your life
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.520]   and saying there's some things inside of me
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.560]   that I'm not proud of, and I repent, I confess.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.880]   I ask for your forgiveness,
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.480]   because I'm tired of trying to be like you.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.240]   I don't wanna disqualify myself
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.280]   from the inheritance that comes in Christ.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.200]   My repentance is my ticket to my inheritance.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.680]   And as I repent and confess and bring it to you,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.520]   I don't do so in a heaviness, I do so in a soberness.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.280]   There's a sober reality to the brokenness in me.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.920]   I bring that to you, but I do in the joy
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.240]   of knowing that you've already forgiven me on the cross
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.040]   and the joy to know that you're now gonna fill me afresh
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.360]   with your spirit and your love,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.200]   and that I'm gonna become your child again,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.440]   and the inheritance of your goodness is mine.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.400]   So I wanna encourage you.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.480]   This message speaks to you at all today
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.400]   about some of the stuff that's involved in you.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   May I invite you to the joy of repentance
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.800]   that brings you back into right relationship with him.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.320]   It is this movement of repentance
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.640]   and the shift of our identities
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.120]   that brings Paul to the part where he starts to talk
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.680]   about the metaphor of darkness and light.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.160]   Paul's of course not the first person
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   to speak about this metaphor.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.000]   In fact, it's a biblical metaphor
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.840]   throughout the whole of redemptive history.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.360]   The Bible in fact starts Genesis 1, verses 1 and 2
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.280]   in a perspective of darkness and light.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.160]   But we learn there that God created the world,
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.000]   the heavens and the earth,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.120]   and it says that the world was formless and void
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.960]   and darkness covered its depths.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.880]   So there is the starting point of darkness in scripture.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.760]   And then in verse 3, we have the first moment
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.600]   where God speaks.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.320]   And the very first word God says is,
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.160]   "Let there be light."
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.120]   Four words, one command, and everything changes.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.920]   And so in the first three verses of the Bible,
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.720]   you get the gospel.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.400]   You get a world that is dark, separated, formless and void,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.080]   and you got a God who decides to make a difference in it.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   A God who says, "I don't want you to remain in darkness.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.000]   "I don't want what I've created to be in darkness."
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.480]   And he says, "Let there be light."
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.240]   And then in the light of that creative moment,
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.560]   the rest of creation happens,
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.360]   all the way up to the culmination of us as human beings,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.880]   created in his image,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.720]   made in the light of Christ and God himself.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.080]   Which is really interesting because then in Genesis 3,
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.880]   Adam and Eve decide to go back into darkness.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.240]   Note that, we decided to go back into darkness.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.200]   In taking of that fruit that we've just been talking about,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.760]   in becoming a peer with God,
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.000]   or thinking that they can become a peer with God,
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.400]   shame comes on them.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.160]   And what does darkness do?
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.680]   Sorry, what does sin do?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.040]   Sin drives Adam and Eve back into darkness.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.760]   They cover themselves.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.200]   They retreat from the presence of God,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.360]   the light of God's presence,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.720]   as God walks in the corners of the evening in the garden.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.160]   They're so afraid of the light of his presence now,
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.200]   that they now retreat,
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.880]   and they go back into a place of darkness,
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.840]   covering their shame.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.160]   And for the rest of the biblical narrative,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.920]   the story is basically this,
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.360]   can humanity ever know what it is
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.920]   to be in the presence of light again?
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.840]   Can we ever know what the light of God is for us?
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.280]   Can we ever have that relationship like Adam and Eve had
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.240]   before they fell in chapter three?
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.160]   Can we know what Genesis 1 and 2?
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.360]   Can we find that place of Shalom,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.440]   the beautiful Jewish concept,
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.400]   of what it is to know that everything is right
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.600]   as it should be, completeness, wholeness, perfection?
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.680]   Our soul writes before God again.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.840]   Towards the end of the Old Testament narrative,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.680]   the prophets begin to speak,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.040]   and to use this metaphor of darkness and light,
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.880]   to basically begin to speak into Israel,
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.840]   and say a time is coming in the future,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.080]   where God will step in,
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.720]   and this messianic hope begins to build
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   towards the end of the Old Testament.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.000]   The prophets begin to speak into this metaphor,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.960]   perhaps most famously, Isaiah,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.480]   and I want you to have a look at some of the passages here
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.920]   that Isaiah begins to speak.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.840]   The people walking in darkness have seen a great light.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.520]   The Lord will turn the darkness into light before his people.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.560]   In the future, the Lord will be your everlasting light,
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.360]   and your days of sorrow will end,
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.360]   and Isaiah starts to point forward
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.880]   to this messianic hope that one would step in,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.960]   one of God, not of us,
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.480]   one who would step in into the fullness of that,
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.360]   and take what is dark right now,
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.120]   like in Genesis verses one and two,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.680]   take that darkness and say, let there be light.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.600]   And of course, for us Christians,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.040]   as we consider who Christ is in the light of this,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.960]   we understand Christ as the messianic fulfillment
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.360]   of that moment,
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.640]   and indeed, the whole of the New Testament
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.760]   picks up that idea,
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.400]   and actually drives the metaphor forward even more.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.920]   So the gospel writers speak of it.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.200]   Look at how John speaks about it here.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.760]   He shines in the darkness,
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.600]   and the darkness has not overcome it.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.480]   He is the true light that gives light to everyone.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.480]   And then Jesus himself takes on this metaphor from Isaiah.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.880]   Have a look at John 8, 12.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.920]   I am the light of the world,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.400]   and whoever follows me will never walk in darkness,
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.840]   but will have the light of life.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.360]   I love this one over here from later on in John.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.680]   You are going to have the light.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.760]   This is Jesus speaking.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.800]   You're going to have the light just a little while longer
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.720]   while you have the light.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.160]   Walk while you have the light
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.960]   before darkness overtakes you.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   Believe in the light
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.160]   so that you may become children of light.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.200]   Jesus has taught this to his disciples.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.160]   Paul picks up on this idea of being children of light,
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.480]   and he brings it into his church as well.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.560]   And so all of this redemptive history
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:03.120]   of biblical understanding of darkness and light
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.760]   comes to its fulfillment in Christ,
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.200]   and then Paul takes that,
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.000]   and he brings it into the very lives of his people.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.520]   Notice how he does this in verse eight.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.360]   I love this.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.240]   He says, "For you were once darkness,
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.560]   "but now you are light in the Lord."
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.720]   I want you to see something really important in this verse.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.760]   Paul does not say, "For you were once in darkness,
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.840]   "and you are now in the light of the Lord,"
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.360]   which I think is so often how we think of it
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.000]   when we hear this passage,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.040]   and I think how we think about our Christian faith,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.120]   as in like, I'm just sort of like neutral,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.000]   and sometimes I find myself in darkness,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.280]   and sometimes I find myself in light.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.480]   As Christians, we think we're neutral,
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.600]   but if life happens, or if I drink a little bit too much,
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   or if I stumble onto that website,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.040]   I'm in darkness for a while.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.760]   But if I have a good week, and I pray well,
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.800]   and I try hard, and I come to church regularly,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   I find myself in the light.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.120]   And we think that we are neutral,
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.840]   and it's just about the place that we're in
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.800]   in terms of our faith.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.920]   Paul looks at that thinking,
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.840]   and he says, "That's faulty thinking."
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.960]   "You're not neutral," he's saying.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.880]   And it's not about the place you're in.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.080]   You need to understand you were darkness.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.360]   The totality of darkness was who you were.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.680]   It wasn't like you were neutral,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.800]   and you just happened to be surrounded by darkness.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.520]   "You were darkness itself," he says.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.360]   Strong words.
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.640]   Because he's wanting you to understand what sin does.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.520]   The wages of sin is what?
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.760]   Death.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.640]   And he's spoken to his church, hasn't he,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.240]   already in chapter two, and he says,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.840]   "When you were in your sins, you were what?
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.680]   "Asleep?"
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.240]   No, he didn't say that.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.320]   He said, "When you were in your sins, you were dead."
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.400]   Like, literally dead.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.280]   So he sees sin in that way.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   So you are not in sin, you were sin, he's saying.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.200]   You were not in darkness, you were darkness.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.720]   You were the separation, you were the death.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.400]   And that's a sobering thing for him to teach his church.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.680]   It's a hard thing for us to think
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.080]   because we like to remain neutral.
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.720]   We like to think that we're neutral people,
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.680]   and it's just whether we're in one thing or in the other.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.600]   And Paul says, "No, no, no.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.720]   "If you think sin is that way,
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.520]   "you will never have a sober understanding
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.640]   "of the power of sin."
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.760]   Come on, church.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.920]   If you think that way, you will always think,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.800]   "Well, if I just try a little bit harder,
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.360]   "or if I get a little bit more faithful,
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.880]   "or read a little bit more of my Bible,
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.920]   "I'm gonna be okay."
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.360]   And Paul's like, "Sin is death.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.400]   "Sin is darkness.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.040]   "And when we're in sin, we are actually darkness."
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.360]   We're not in it, we are the darkness.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.280]   Now, as sobering as that is, he then says,
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.760]   "But guess what?
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.040]   "Now that you're in Christ, you are the light."
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.400]   In other words, it's not a temporary location for you,
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.880]   and you're moving in and out.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.520]   He's saying, "Now you are light.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.080]   "You are the light of the world."
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.720]   It's funny 'cause Jesus calls himself the light of the world,
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.440]   but then later on, he says to the disciples,
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.560]   "You're the light of the world."
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.000]   And this is what Paul's picking up on here.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.120]   He's saying, "You were darkness, now you are light,"
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.480]   which is why he says this.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.160]   He says, "Live as children of light."
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.520]   He says, "Live a life like this.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.320]   "Live with boldness and courage.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.840]   "Live with hope and faith.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.680]   "Live as if the light really is in you,
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.480]   "that you are this light in the world."
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.920]   He's like, "I want you to live like that."
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.000]   And the question that the church in Ephesus
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.680]   should have asked, and I think we need to ask, is this.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.080]   How do I live as children of light
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.720]   in a world that continues to be so filled with darkness?
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.960]   That's an important question for us at the Vine.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.880]   How do we want to, how are we able to live
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.880]   as children of light in a world
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:58.240]   that is still so filled with darkness?
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.640]   Paul offers two answers to that question.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.920]   It's found in verses 13 and 14.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.040]   Let me read these verses.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.600]   These are beautiful to me.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.480]   He says this, "But everything exposed
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.800]   "by the light becomes visible,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.000]   "and everything illuminated becomes a light."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.960]   I'm gonna read that again.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.720]   "But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.920]   "and everything illuminated becomes a light."
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.840]   He's like, "Do you want to know how it is
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.320]   "that you're able to walk as a child of light?
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.600]   "First of all, you have to understand
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.080]   "that you could not do anything because you were darkness.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.680]   "God had to step in and do it, first of all, for you.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.360]   "Everything that is exposed by the light becomes visible."
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.440]   Light's this fascinating thing.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.760]   If you look at it scientifically,
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.960]   essentially a definition of what light is
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.800]   is it's electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.480]   that is visible to the human eye.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.560]   Write that down in your notes.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.560]   That's very important.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.080]   And here's the crazy thing.
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.240]   It is about 400 to 700 nanometers in size.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.880]   Very, very, very, very small.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.840]   And it travels at one of the fastest things it can travel.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.840]   It travels at 182, 868 miles per second.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.640]   Not miles per hour, miles per second.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.200]   So what light does is it goes out
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.800]   and it bounces off of the surface of the thing.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.160]   Look around you right now.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.120]   Okay, you can see the people in this room
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.760]   because there is some light in this room,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.280]   and that electromagnetic radiation is bouncing
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.240]   off of the people around you, enabling you to see them.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.520]   But here's the reality.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.360]   We're blind or we're in darkness
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:36.040]   when actually that electromagnetic radiation
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.600]   of a wavelength is removed.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.640]   When light is removed, we have no ability
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.560]   to bounce off of one another
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.400]   to actually look at each other and see.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.600]   So Paul, when he's talking about those sins
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.560]   of sexual morality and greed and brokenness,
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.640]   what he's basically saying is you've got all this stuff
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.920]   that's at work in you, and what that's causing you to do
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.080]   is become blind to one another.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.320]   You can't see each other, nor can you see God
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.720]   because you're now in an environment
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.920]   where you are completely in the dark, he's saying,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.200]   because it has cut out all of the light,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.600]   and you cannot see anymore.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.520]   And this is a sobering thing.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.960]   I want you to feel this.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.080]   I know that there's still a little bit
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.920]   of ambient light in here.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.520]   We can't make this place completely dark
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.240]   because of the exit signs and a whole bunch of other things,
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.440]   but I want you to kind of look around as well.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.640]   We can't see each other as clearly anymore.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.080]   And basically what Paul's teaching is,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.360]   this is what sin does.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.600]   It causes you to become blind.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.200]   It's like you can't see your hand in front of your face,
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   and there's nothing you can do to change that.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.600]   But then, because God so loved the world,
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.120]   here's what he does.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.240]   In Christ, he basically says this,
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.880]   "Let there be light, and there was light."
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.040]   So the light, yeah.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.520]   (congregation applauding)
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.560]   I love this.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.400]   I love this.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.480]   Half of you were sitting there
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.440]   throughout the whole service going,
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.160]   "Why have they not fixed that horrible thing
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.920]   that's hanging in the middle of the room?"
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.560]   That's Jesus right there.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.120]   But the light comes.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.320]   God brings this light.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.720]   Now, I want you to notice the room again.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.360]   Like, we can begin to see each other again.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.120]   Not only that, but we can begin to see ourselves.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.920]   See, Paul says everything is exposed by the light
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.000]   that makes everything visible.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.880]   So Jesus makes everything visible.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.200]   Everything inside of me that is broken and dark,
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.520]   the darkness, my darkness, the fact that I am darkness,
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.560]   I can only tell that when the light shines.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.000]   Otherwise, I'm ignorant.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.920]   Otherwise, I'm blind to it.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.400]   I've got the hand in front of my face, and I can't see it.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.040]   But Christ, as he comes with the light,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.760]   it changes everything within me,
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.400]   and I can begin to go, "Hang on a sec.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.520]   There is the brokenness.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.640]   There is the darkness.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.000]   There is the sin, and I need to somehow deal with that."
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.320]   The light, Paul says, makes everything visible.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.880]   It exposes it, he says.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.960]   But then he says something that is really key.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.320]   He then says, "Not only does the light of Christ
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.680]   enable you to begin to see yourself
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.360]   as you should see yourself,
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.120]   and see one another as we should see one another,"
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.680]   he then says, and this is really important,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.760]   "Everything that is illuminated becomes a light."
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.120]   He uses this wonderful word,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.280]   this idea of something being illuminated.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.960]   It's a beautiful phrase for salvation.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.400]   It's one of the only times Paul uses it
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.440]   to speak of our salvation.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.000]   He says, "Everything that becomes illuminated,"
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   in other words, everything that becomes illuminated
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.720]   by the light, he says, "It's not just," note this,
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.720]   "It's not just so that you can see the darkness, finally,
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.080]   and do something about it.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.320]   It's not just so that you can kind of connect
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   with one another."
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.320]   What he's also saying is, you've got to understand
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.440]   that there's something else also at play here, right?
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.360]   And what else is at play is that every one of us
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.680]   has the potential to become this kind of light
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.240]   that Christ has, and that light that Christ wants to give us.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.600]   We have this potential sitting within us.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.920]   But when we're in darkness, when we are the darkness,
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.480]   that potential is not there at all.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.160]   And we're walking around like this, are you with me?
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.040]   But Paul says, first of all, Jesus' light illuminates
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.360]   everything for us so that we can realize
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.000]   that there's nothing going on here.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.040]   But then he says, "Everything, though, that is illuminated
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.640]   becomes a light."
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.880]   In other words, in our relationship with Christ,
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.200]   we then become the light.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.480]   It's like Paul is saying, you've got to understand
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.920]   that Christ illuminates everything,
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.040]   but everything that becomes illuminated becomes a light.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.840]   (congregation exclaims)
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.680]   Right?
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.360]   (congregation applauds)
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   And because it's a light, it's not our light, remember?
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.480]   Our light, it would be like this, right?
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.640]   Our light, we have no light, but when we come
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.120]   into relationship with the light, we bring his light now.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.560]   And Paul says, "You were once darkness, now you're light."
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.240]   So then he says, "Live as children of light."
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.160]   Like take the light into the darker places around you
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.360]   and begin to shine that light so that the darkness
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.280]   in people and the darkness around can be seen,
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.440]   not in a way of judging them.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.520]   He uses this word exposed.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.600]   I love this word exposed.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.080]   It literally means to prove with evidence.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   Paul's saying, "Your job is not to go to the dark places."
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:40.160]   I'm gonna go to the really dark places out here somewhere.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.960]   This is real, these guys are very, I'm coming here.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.160]   "Your job is not to go to the really dark places
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.960]   and start bashing people with the light."
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   You know, start like kind of slandering them
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.600]   and, "Oh, you guys are terrible.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.760]   Can't you see how you're living your life?
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   Oh, you guys suck."
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.040]   (groans)
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.800]   He's saying, "Prove with evidence that your light shines."
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.120]   What does that mean?
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.240]   Well, he actually defines it.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.520]   He says, "For the fruit of those who are light
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.280]   is goodness, justice, and truth."
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:15.080]   The things that we do and the ways that we live
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.520]   reflects the light of Christ that is within us.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.440]   We don't have to go wagging our fingers.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.400]   We just go, "Check this out.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.000]   Like, wouldn't you wanna be a part of this?
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.360]   Wouldn't you want that dead thing
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.600]   that's in you to be alive again?
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.760]   Like, if it got dead, wouldn't you wanna make it?"
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.600]   Oh, darn it.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.680]   Okay, okay.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.560]   So, but wouldn't you wanna make it alive again, right?
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.240]   And he's like, "That's the invitation in this passage."
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.000]   Paul is not saying, "Hey, wag your finger in judgment."
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.640]   He's saying, "Invite people to redemption.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.840]   Live your light like that."
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.560]   I love this.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.480]   Jesus says it this way in Matthew.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.760]   I love this passage from Christ.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.600]   He says it this way.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.760]   He says, "Let your light shine before all people
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.840]   that they may see your good deeds
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.360]   and praise your Father in heaven."
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   Not praise you.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.320]   Praise your Father in heaven.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.880]   They will see your good deeds.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.480]   I think church history has shown us this beautifully.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   I think of people like John and Charles Wesley
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.440]   who took the light of Christ that was within them
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.680]   to the darkness of London in the mid 1700s
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.400]   and brought revival to that land.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:27.040]   I think of William Wilberforce and the Clapham sect
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.920]   in the late 1700s,
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.120]   who took the light of Christ that was within them
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.000]   and brought it to the darkness of slavery
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.080]   and over a 25 year long journey and battle
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.200]   was able to see that abolished in the British empire.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.040]   I think of Amy Carmichael,
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.880]   who took the light that God had given her
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.040]   in the early 1900s and traveled to India,
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.440]   to the North of India
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.360]   and actually stood against the darkness
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   of child exploitation and child abuse
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.240]   in the Hindu temples of that time.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.360]   I think of Martin Luther King Jr. in the 60s,
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.640]   more closer perhaps to us,
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.800]   who saw the darkness of injustice and decided,
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.760]   and racism and decided to make a difference about it
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.160]   and brought the light that was in him
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.920]   to bear on a whole nation.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.720]   And Paul is writing this and he's saying,
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.560]   "I want you to live as children of light
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.800]   because you're not darkness, you are light,
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.160]   but there is still darkness.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.840]   And I want you to go in the goodness
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.520]   and in that justice and in that truth
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.560]   that is placed inside of you because of the light
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.720]   and shine that light brightly."
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.800]   This is why he says this beautiful thing right here.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.320]   He says this beautiful thing here.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.920]   He says, this is why it says,
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:38.360]   "Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.720]   and Christ will shine on you."
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.680]   This is like Paul, by the way,
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.480]   this is not a quote from scripture.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.800]   This is not Paul kind of basically saying something like,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.480]   oh, by the way, it says in Jeremiah this.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.960]   Actually, scholars think what he's doing here
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.640]   is quoting from an early Christian hymn
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.360]   that was active in the church at the time.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.880]   So this is like him quoting a worship song.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.000]   And he stands before the church and goes,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.280]   "Don't you know that we sing this?
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.680]   Don't you know that we say this to each other?
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.760]   Wake up, O sleeper."
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:05.840]   That's exactly what he's saying.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.200]   He's saying, "You've got the light of Christ in you.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.000]   Live as a child of the light.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.160]   Wake up."
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   He's saying, "Wake up, church.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.280]   How can you live like you are living right now
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.520]   in all that brokenness that dims your light
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.960]   and causes separation?
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   No, deal with your sin, come into repentance,
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.360]   receive the light that you truly are in Him,
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.400]   and then live in that light."
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.160]   It's like Paul is kind of saying,
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.560]   "Where are those who are willing to stand up
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.520]   for goodness, justice, and truth?
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.480]   May your good deed shine before all people
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.360]   and may they come to know Him."
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.680]   And I stand before us today.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.640]   And I think about this so often.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.720]   I'm like, "Where are the Amy Carmichael's of our time?
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.680]   Where's the Martin Luther King Jr.?
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.560]   Where's the John and Charles Wesley?"
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.880]   Like, where is it within the church in Hong Kong?
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.600]   Where is it within us?
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.960]   Well, in our little bit,
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.600]   maybe we're not gonna change the world or change society,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.800]   but maybe there's a relationship
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.280]   that's broken in our workplace.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.600]   Maybe there's someone that we know who needs forgiveness.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.360]   Maybe there's someone who's desperately lonely
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.200]   and we could befriend them.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.760]   I don't know how it might look for you,
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.840]   but you've got the light.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.680]   So live as a child of light.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.840]   Wake up.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.520]   Take a hold of what it is that Christ has placed
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.280]   inside of you, goodness and justice and truth,
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.280]   and be that in whatever darkness He has placed you in.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.040]   And when we do this,
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.400]   we come to see light like we've never seen it before.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.480]   May you let your light shine.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.920]   May you do it proudly with courage and boldness.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.320]   And may we see the darkness around us become light.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.160]   Amen.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.580]   (congregation applauding)
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.560]   I wonder if you could stand with me
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.200]   and I would love to pray for you.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:08.560]   And I wonder whether you just,
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.040]   as you quieten your eyes,
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.160]   quieten your eyes, that's a bit weird.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.960]   As you close your eyes, quieten your heart.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.360]   I know we're running a bit long, but I just wanna,
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:24.400]   there's so many of us who have been called
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   to shine our light and it's not always an easy thing to do.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:33.880]   I wanna just invite you just to quieten your heart now.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.460]   (gentle music)
[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:40.360]   For some of you in this room,
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.080]   what is really important for you today is repentance.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.320]   And like I've said in the message,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.440]   this is not something you have to fear.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.840]   It doesn't have to be heavy.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.840]   But that recognition, I'm trying to become a peer of yours,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.480]   even though maybe I've never said it that way,
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.740]   but I'm actually really self-centered.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.520]   Actually, everything is kind of about me.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.320]   And I think the Lord wants to break self-centeredness
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.880]   out of us as a community.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.320]   And that will require repentance.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.400]   But it's the joy of that,
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.880]   knowing that our relationship has been shifted
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.280]   from that peer of God to a child of God again.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.760]   And I think for some of you here,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.880]   that's a really important response for you.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.280]   To respond in that openness
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.680]   of what it is to bring your confession
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.840]   and repentance to Him.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.160]   Some of you just need to say,
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.480]   "I don't wanna be your peer.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.520]   "I don't want the universe to revolve around me.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.520]   "I don't want my self-centeredness
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.360]   "to be the main thing in my life.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.160]   "I want you to be the main thing in my life.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.200]   "I need to repent."
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.120]   And I can see that that's manifesting
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.240]   in the way I treat others.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.600]   It's manifesting in my sexual immorality.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:43:59.880]   It's manifesting in my greed.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.280]   It's manifesting in my coarse language and my jokes.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.320]   It's manifesting in my joking and my gossiping
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.720]   and slandering or whatever it is.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.320]   But Lord, I recognize it's manifesting itself
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.880]   in these ways that are actually bringing division
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.800]   and not unity.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.240]   Lord, that's not what I want.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.320]   I'm a child of light.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.440]   So I wanna just encourage some of you now.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.600]   That's the work Christ is inviting you into.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.120]   But for maybe many of us,
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.160]   it's this work of recognizing that our light
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.680]   has been hidden for a while.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.200]   Turn your light before all people
[00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.160]   so that they would see your good deeds.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.080]   Not see how cool you are,
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.880]   not see how gifted or talented you are.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.480]   They would see your heart,
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.240]   the goodness and the justice and the truth
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.800]   that sits within you, the fruits of light.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.680]   They would see those things and they would change
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   because they would see.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.560]   Remember, everything that is light exposes
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.320]   and makes things visible.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.960]   And so I wanna just pray an anointing over you here
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.800]   this morning
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.360]   to be able to shine the light of Jesus
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.920]   without any sense of doubt,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.200]   without any sense of apology,
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.640]   without any sense of being ashamed.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.080]   For Paul says, "I am unashamed of the gospel,
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:22.400]   "but to do so in love, to do so in grace,
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.440]   "to do so seeking the good of others,
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.080]   "to do so by laying your life down
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.400]   "and picking up your cross,
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.600]   "doing so by putting others before yourself,
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.800]   "doing so by revealing goodness and justice and truth."
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:38.720]   And so Lord, I pray you would release your people in this.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.920]   And Father, we thank you so much for this.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.080]   We're gonna just take a moment to respond in worship
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.000]   'cause I think it's really important
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   that you take this time.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.240]   If you need to repent, you take the time to repent.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.040]   If you need to ask God to strengthen your hands
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.880]   like we talked about earlier, pray that.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.400]   If you want your light to shine more,
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.880]   ask him to show you how you can do that
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.960]   in your sphere of influence.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.560]   But every single part of it,
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.760]   let's bring it to him now in worship.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.360]   (gentle music)
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.940]   (gentle music)
