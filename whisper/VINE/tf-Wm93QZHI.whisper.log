[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:14.560]   - Imagine with me for a moment, a church.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.600]   This is not a church in the singular,
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.260]   on its own and distinct, but a church in the plural,
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.480]   united across a nation, joined in purpose,
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.240]   focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.800]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.360]   the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.760]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.600]   that such a story brings.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.680]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.400]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.880]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.760]   and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.960]   A church that sees salvation as holistic,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.780]   transforming God's people for God's work,
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.800]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.600]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.520]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.860]   as integral to all that it's called to be and do,
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.240]   involving intentional, committed,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.120]   and authentic relationships across all levels.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.000]   It is the sort of place where both the young
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.420]   and the old feel cared for, supported, and equipped.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.720]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.000]   come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.680]   that honors and embraces a richness in diversity
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.920]   that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.480]   It is a church that is willing to innovate
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.000]   and express faith creatively,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.200]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.560]   as glory to him.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.880]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.600]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.440]   where they seek to develop an intelligent spiritual faith
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.880]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   A church that does not make its Sunday services
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.200]   the exclamation mark of its existence,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.420]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.000]   a time of service, love, and engagement
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.080]   that inspires and emboldens all equally
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.260]   for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.400]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.720]   This is our city.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.240]   This is our church.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.520]   This is our home.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.460]   - Good morning, how's everyone doing?
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.460]   Welcome to the Vine Yunlong.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.720]   I'm not Tim, but my name is Justin.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.560]   I'm one of the pastors at the Vine Wan Chai.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.220]   You're probably wondering, where is Tim?
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.840]   Where is our pastor?
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.460]   Actually, he's not feeling quite well,
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.260]   so he asked me whether I could service lead today,
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.280]   and I gladly said yes.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.820]   Even behind the scenes, Tim, Ivan, and I,
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.800]   we have a lot to talk about,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.160]   and we often support each other,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.560]   so it's great to be here.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.200]   (soft piano music)
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.240]   Yeah, just grab a seat, have a seat.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.600]   It's good to see everyone.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.280]   You know, every Saturday morning,
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.820]   or every Saturday before Sunday,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.640]   I ask myself, you know,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.680]   what's gonna happen tomorrow on Sunday?
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.360]   You know, Lord, what are you gonna do?
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.200]   And yesterday morning on Saturday,
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.080]   I did not know I would be here,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.820]   I would get to spend time with you in Yunlong,
[00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.400]   and I'm just, I think it's God's thing, you know,
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.020]   just to, yeah, just really, just to bring us places,
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.520]   and I think all of you are here for a reason.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.260]   I know a lot of you, this is your home church,
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.560]   and so, church, I just wanna ask you,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.400]   what is your expectation as we come here
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.600]   to worship together today?
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.800]   And I just want you to think about that.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.920]   What do you expect today?
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.720]   What are you expecting God to show you, to reveal to you?
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.280]   And so, as you think about this, church,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.320]   can I ask you to stand?
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.740]   I'm gonna pray, and we are gonna spend this time
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.340]   in God's presence together on this beautiful Sunday,
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.840]   and so would you pray with me?
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.740]   Jesus, yeah, we just, yeah,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.240]   we think about why we're here this morning,
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.420]   and it's not just because this is our church,
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.800]   but we are here because we want to encounter the living God.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.620]   We want to spend time as church family
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.460]   to worship you, to hear your word today,
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.580]   to give you glory, to be reminded that you are God,
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.880]   we are your children, and so, Father,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.080]   for those of us that we've had a tired week,
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.620]   we had a crazy week, Lord, we ask you to revive us today.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.620]   We ask you to restore onto us peace and joy and rest,
[00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.860]   and Father, above all, we ask that you reveal yourself
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.940]   to all of us today, from the youngest
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.500]   to just all of us in this room.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.920]   And so, Father, we thank you, and we just give you glory.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.740]   We love you, in your name we pray, amen.
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.540]   Let's worship him together, church.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.260]   - Thanks, Lord, thanks, Lord, send God is.

[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   Father, we are here because we believe in our hearts
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.200]   that you are God and that you are worthy
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   and that in your hands is life and life abundant.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.440]   It's eternal life.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.520]   And to you, Father, we look to you in adoration,
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.000]   in humility, in surrender.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.680]   And this morning, Lord, we yield to you
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.800]   and we say, Lord, lead us in the seasons that we're in,
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.600]   in the valleys that we're in,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.760]   in the mountains we are overwhelmed by.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.200]   We look to you and we yield to you knowing, Lord God,
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.560]   you will lead us one step at a time, one day at a time.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.720]   You'll lead our families, you'll lead our communities.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.520]   And today, Father, we put aside everything
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.600]   that's happened this week and we ask you, Lord God,
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.560]   to have us and to lead us.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.560]   And just as we sang this morning, you don't owe us anything,
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.120]   but we love you and we look to you.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.520]   And so, Father, hear our prayers this morning.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.960]   So, church, I just want to ask you
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.760]   just to let your prayers rise.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.160]   The things that you've been praying this week, this morning,
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.240]   the things that you know the Lord has heard you,
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.280]   just give that up to him.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.400]   This is an act of faith for us as a community
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.320]   to know that together we come together
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.240]   because we know he hears us, he loves us.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.600]   And there's something that we cannot attain
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.880]   on our own by ourselves.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.440]   And that's why we gather like this every Sunday,
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.920]   as regular as much as we can.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.000]   And so, Father, you see us, you hear our prayers.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Together we now pray, Jesus, we love you, amen.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.360]   Amen, amen.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.760]   Let's give him a clap of offering, we can do that.

[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.880]   Father, we just pray that you encounter them,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.080]   you pour your love,
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.600]   and you pour your everything into them, Father.

[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.280]   (audience cheering)

[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.520]   This is actually my first time in this venue.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.240]   And so it's so good to finally imagine

[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.040]   and so you can't get rid of me yet.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.360]   So, hey, this morning I have a few announcements
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.680]   for us as a church family
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.720]   and I'd like to begin to actually invite Denise up first.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.160]   She is our church administrator.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.680]   You see her every week.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.560]   And so, she's gonna share something
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.480]   and then, yeah, we'll go from there.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.320]   Thank you.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.080]   Thank you.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.000]   Today, I stand before everyone with a happy heart
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.600]   as I have made a difficult decision
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.280]   to depart from my role as church administrator
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.520]   of the Vine Church.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.040]   I want to take this opportunity
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.400]   to express my deepest appreciation to every one of you.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:51.480]   Serving as this role has been an incredible privilege
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.680]   and a true blessing in my life.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   The Vine Church, Yundong,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.440]   has not only been a place of worship,
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.440]   but also a community and a family
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.280]   that has touched my heart in countless way.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.520]   The Vine Church, Yundong,
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.520]   has always hold a special place in my heart
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.480]   and I am confident that
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:26.080]   our path will cross again in the future.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:32.440]   I firmly believe in the continuous success
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.920]   and growth of this church
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.000]   and I have no doubt that
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.360]   the Vine Church will continue to make a profound impact
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.760]   on the life of many.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:59.000]   May God's grace continue to guide and abundantly
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.880]   bless the Vine Church, Yundong.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.720]   Thank you.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.520]   - We're gonna pray for Denise together as a church.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.520]   Actually, I don't know if you know,
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.040]   but Denise has been here for a long while.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.160]   Denise and I used to be on the same team
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.680]   and every week we would have our weekly catch-ups
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.360]   and I would secretly, selfishly ask Denise,
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.520]   Denise, you're not going yet, right?
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.440]   You're not going yet, right?
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.960]   It's like, no, no, it's not my time yet,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.800]   it's not my time yet.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.200]   And then this week as a church family,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.440]   we heard about Denise's announcement
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.720]   and I just, I don't know, just to be here right now,
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.480]   it just means a lot, I think, for all of us.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.560]   And so, church, can I ask you to stand?
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.600]   You can stretch out your hands
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.920]   and we're just gonna pray for you,
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.400]   we're gonna bless you, okay?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.520]   Father, we pray as Denise's church family,
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.580]   even though she's stepping down from her role, Lord God,
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.280]   we are still family and she is still our sister
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.640]   and we just wanna first off thank you
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.560]   for bringing Denise to the Vine Wan Chai in Yundong
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.560]   and she's done so much, the things that can be seen
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.100]   and she's done even more behind the scenes.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.640]   And she's such a humble person, Lord God,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.320]   that she just does not draw attention to herself
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.080]   and she's done so much and you know that.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.920]   And so, Father, we just thank you so much
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   for the gift that Denise is.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.520]   We thank you that she's always asking us how we're doing,
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.020]   she's bringing coffees, she's just caring for us,
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.160]   she's prayerfully just around, Father,
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.100]   and we just thank you so much.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.920]   Thank you for, you know, the fact that we're here today,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.320]   Denise has poured in so much into Vine Yundong.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.660]   And so, Father, we just right now wanna just,
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.640]   as a church, gather around her
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.260]   and pray your blessing over her in the next season.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.100]   Whatever it looks like, wherever she's gonna be, Father,
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.620]   whatever she puts her hands and minds and hearts to,
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.460]   Father, we pray that your gospel
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.720]   would be preached through Denise,
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.560]   that in her quiet but courageous, bold spirit,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.180]   that you would be proclaimed.
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.860]   And so, Father, though we will miss her,
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.780]   we just are excited what she is gonna do
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.580]   and what you're gonna do with her and through her.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.700]   And so, Father, we just celebrate Denise today
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.540]   with a heavy heart, but our heart is that
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.780]   you would pour your heart and your spirit over her
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.160]   for as long as, yeah, just for the days ahead, Jesus.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.420]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.320]   >> Thank you.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.300]   >> All right, so do take her out for coffee
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.220]   and do say hi to her, and yeah, have a seat.
[00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:32.040]   Thank you, church.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.220]   I just have a few important announcements
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.140]   that I am tasked to bring to you,
[00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.300]   and two of them pertains to what's happening
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.360]   this coming up in March,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.500]   and another one pertains to this Sunday.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.980]   Pastor Tim told me that it is your culture
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.460]   that after service you would bring your own lunch
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.180]   and fellowship and have lunch together,
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.260]   and I think that is such a beautiful expression,
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:59.380]   and it's just the best way to spend Sunday afternoon.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.500]   So if you don't have anywhere to go
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.940]   and you wanna get to know people,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.140]   you want to reconnect, you wanna just hang out,
[00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.140]   so just ask you to, after service,
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.060]   go and grab lunch somewhere, come back,
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.680]   and we're gonna eat together,
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.700]   and Pastor Tim also reminded me
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.260]   of the special thing that you guys do,
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.500]   and during this lunch the goal is to talk
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.320]   to at least two people you don't know
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.940]   as well as catch up with everyone else,
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.180]   so I'm really happy to hear that.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.540]   I hope you can come.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.980]   I'm gonna join you later in March for this one
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.140]   if you have it on the 24th, so I'm excited for that.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.340]   So two more announcements that pertains to March,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.500]   and one of the big announcements is,
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.800]   do you guys know what's happening next Sunday?
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.260]   Yes, it's Vision Sunday, and so whether it's
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.120]   the wine, wine chai, or wine yunlong,
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.340]   March is our Vision Sunday, and this is a special time
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.100]   where Pastor Tim, Pastor Ivan is gonna bring
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.020]   a specific vision of what they are sensing,
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:58.120]   what the leadership is sensing for us as a church
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.120]   in terms of maybe God is calling us into something,
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.180]   he's calling us to think about something
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.900]   and work out something, and so this is a Sunday
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:09.820]   where we ask everyone coming to bring their tithes
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.940]   and offering that is beyond their normal giving
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.100]   because this is a time for us to, in faith,
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.340]   sow into the vision of what is happening here,
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.840]   and so in previous Vision Sundays, a few years ago,
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.300]   we had a vision to plant a church in Yunlong,
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.260]   and the Sunday, Vision Sunday after that,
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.860]   we started getting funds and fundraising
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.920]   for the Vine Church Yunlong, that was last year,
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.680]   and church, here we are.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.440]   Right now, we are sitting in the generosity of God,
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.700]   the leading of God, and also the giving of everyone here
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.600]   and those in wine chai because we're a church,
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.440]   and so I just want to humbly ask you to come in faith,
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.780]   and if you say, hey, Justin, all I can give is a dollar,
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.420]   that's fine, you know, I think what's more important,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.680]   I think what's on Tim and Ivan's heart and my heart
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.080]   and our heart at Divine Leadership
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.680]   is that you come in faith, and together,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.960]   we hear what Pastor Tim and Ivan have for us
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   as a Cantonese congregation as well as English congregation
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.880]   and how God is gonna ask us to grow, okay?
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.640]   So that's next Sunday, please come in faith,
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.480]   and then another thing that I wanna announce
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.680]   is the Sunday afterwards, which is March 9th, okay,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.860]   from three o'clock to five o'clock,
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.540]   we are going to actually have
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.420]   a parenting workshop in Cantonese.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.820]   So if you're a Cantonese speaker, you're a parent,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.640]   or you know someone who could benefit
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.240]   from a parenting workshop,
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   we'll have two special guest speakers
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.240]   who I'm curious to know who they are,
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.440]   and really, actually, the heart of this from Tim and Ivan
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.400]   is, you know, we are here to share the gospel,
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.040]   we're here to invest in this city,
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.280]   and one of the ways we do this
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.360]   is by hosting parenting workshops so that, as parents,
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.700]   those who have children, those who want to grow
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.280]   in our identity and role and responsibility as parents,
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.000]   we can come and support one another,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.800]   and this is a tangible way
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.100]   in which we can support this neighborhood.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.020]   And so if you speak Cantonese, once again,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:14.980]   please, you're interested, you can get more information.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.800]   Now, I know you're like, "Yo, Justin, I speak English."
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.440]   We're planning something in June, okay,
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.500]   for a parenting workshop in June, so stay tuned.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.180]   Tim and Ivan will bring more news on that.
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.460]   Yes, thank you, it's a Saturday.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.440]   Yes, thank you.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.260]   So with that, I think I'm gonna,
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.120]   I'd like to ask the offering team to,
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.100]   we're gonna take up our weekly offering,
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.140]   and yeah, once again, there's many ways to give.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.540]   You can give through the envelopes,
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.940]   you can also digitally give,
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.740]   and I think just on behalf of Tim and Ivan
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.780]   and the leadership, just want to continue
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.020]   just to thank you for your generosity.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.800]   And really, once again, we are all sitting
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.260]   in each other's offering, the offering
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.720]   and the generosity of the church.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:06.180]   And so, yeah, let's pray, and then,
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.180]   actually, I'm gonna ask Pastor John to come up first,
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.100]   and we're gonna pray for Pastor John
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.260]   as well as we're gonna pray for our offering.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.500]   And so Pastor John is gonna give the word today,
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.500]   and you're a regular here, right?
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.780]   - Yeah, I am. - Yes, so.
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.060]   All right, let's pray. - I'm a regular boy.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.340]   Father, we give you our offering, we give you ourselves,
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.940]   and we just ask that you continue to grow your bride,
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.180]   your church, your body.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:33.380]   We ask you to grow you in long church.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:37.740]   Together, we just, in faith, so every Sunday
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.940]   in our worship and in our relationships,
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.740]   knowing that you are leading us,
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.540]   you are preaching and proclaiming the gospel
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.940]   through each one of us.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.100]   And so, Father, remind us how much you've given us
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.020]   so that we can be generous.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.860]   And so, this morning, we thank you for Pastor John
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.700]   that he has prepared a word for us,
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.120]   that he's gonna preach this in faith,
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.880]   and we receive this in faith,
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.900]   knowing that you are speaking to each of us
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.620]   through Pastor John.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.640]   So we make room in our hearts for you now, amen.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.060]   - Thank you, Justin.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:25.000]   Thank you, Justin, that was amazing.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.480]   It's good to be with you this morning
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.460]   on this little cooler morning.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:36.600]   I am a Hong Konger.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.400]   Hong Kong is Sandra and I's adopted home
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.340]   and has been for the last 37 years.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.100]   Its people are my family.
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:55.040]   My sons, their wives, and five grandchildren
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.540]   are also Hong Kongers.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:02.280]   The grandchildren were all made in Hong Kong,
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.880]   well, to my knowledge, anyway.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.580]   And they were born here, of that I can be sure.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.940]   Don't be put off by my face.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.420]   Yes, I am a guai lou.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:23.180]   Don't be put off by my lack of Chinese.
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:28.100]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:33.100]   Well, to be truthful, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.320]   I love Hong Kong.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.660]   Tim told us last week that it doesn't matter
[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.820]   whether we are an expat, a local,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:51.160]   a domestic helper, or an asylum seeker.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.580]   It doesn't matter whether we are a street sleeper
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.340]   or we're chairman of HSBC.
[00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.200]   This is home.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:09.140]   And Tim used a famous passage in Jeremiah 29 to tell us.
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.380]   And yes, as he said, it does contain the famous
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.720]   2911 fridge magnet bookmark photo frame verse.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:23.640]   To seek the peace and prosperity of the city.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.020]   He reminded us that this word of God
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.760]   was given to a people in exile,
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:36.700]   the Israelites, who spent 70 years, yes, 70 years,
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:42.040]   as strangers and aliens in Babylon.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.060]   Tim used this to challenge us
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.860]   to become engaged in our city.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.860]   That there was no excuse for apathetic disengagement.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.020]   But if that was the what,
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.580]   today I want to look at the how.
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:13.060]   How can I, as an expat, a domestic helper,
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.220]   asylum seeker, street sleeper, or chairman of HSBC,
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.300]   how can I, as a member of Vine Yuen Long,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.580]   contribute, contribute to the peace
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.420]   and prosperity of our city?
[00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:32.900]   You see, whereas in the first message,
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.860]   we looked at how we relate to Hong Kong and Yuen Long
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.040]   from a big picture perspective,
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.200]   this time we want to look in more detail.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:50.300]   What does it actually mean to love the place we're in
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.060]   and to work for its welfare and peace?
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.140]   More especially, how can we use
[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.780]   the church's resources, our faith resources,
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.300]   to bring flourishing to Yuen Long?
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:09.420]   How can we use our difference to serve people?
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   Today we will think about our spheres of influence
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.100]   and how we can contribute to the flourishing
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.300]   and well-being of Yuen Long and its people.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.300]   So that people will see our good work
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:33.720]   and praise God in heaven.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.660]   And I'll tell you something.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:42.220]   I'm gonna make it simple.
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:47.980]   So embarrassingly simple.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   To demonstrate, I'm turning to two household items.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.940]   They're actually all in this one thing.
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.420]   How can you talk about salt and light
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.260]   and have it in one thing?
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.020]   Look at that, salt and light.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.740]   Press it again.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:12.300]   Yes.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.240]   Salt and light.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.260]   It's for you, Byron.
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.340]   Let's look at scripture.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.940]   Let's turn to Matthew 5.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.180]   Let's start at verse 13.
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:34.860]   You, yes you.
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.500]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.140]   But if salt's lost its taste,
[00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.340]   how shall its saltiness be restored?
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.500]   It is no longer good for anything
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:54.180]   except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:59.540]   You are the light of the world.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:04.300]   A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.860]   Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.860]   but on a stand so it gives light to all the house.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:18.740]   In the same way, let your light shine before others
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:23.460]   so that they may see your good works
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:28.300]   and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:34.580]   Let me start by giving you some background.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:39.140]   This section is from the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:41.640]   Matthew 5, 6, 7.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.940]   Amazing chapters.
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:48.940]   Jesus' audiences were the disciples of Jesus
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:55.100]   and the crowd who were the future disciples of Jesus.
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.600]   And what they were doing,
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   they were weighing the cost of following Jesus.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.580]   And the background to my teaching this morning
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.580]   can be found in Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.620]   And particularly his teaching on the kingdom of God
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.100]   also described as the kingdom of heaven.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.760]   Jesus had told them in Matthew 4
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.320]   that repentance is the key to entering
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.240]   the kingdom of heaven.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.360]   I've put it on the screen.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.520]   From that time, Jesus began to preach,
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:35.520]   saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.440]   As the Sermon on the Mount continues,
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.760]   Jesus answers the important question.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.520]   Who, who can enter the kingdom of heaven?
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.860]   Who can enter the kingdom of God?
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:56.920]   He answers it with what we call the Beatitudes.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.200]   I heard that Billy Graham
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.280]   had actually called them beautiful attitudes.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.120]   I love that.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.140]   I heard a story of a Chinese Christian
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.100]   who came to a missionary one time and said,
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.720]   "I've learned to quote the Sermon on the Mount by memory."
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.800]   He stood before the missionary
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   and perfectly quoted the sermon word for word.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.440]   The missionary said, "That's wonderful.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.820]   How did you do it?"
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.360]   The Chinese Christian said this,
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.220]   "I spent the last year trying to live it."
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:37.580]   Matthew 5, three to six tells us,
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.880]   "It is the poor and spirit, those who mourn, the meek,
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.160]   those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.020]   who can enter the kingdom of God."
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.600]   In verses seven to nine,
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   he then describes the attitude of a kingdom person
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:57.500]   as merciful, pure in heart, a peacemaker.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:02.020]   "We are told we will be called children of God."
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.820]   All this seems good.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   But Matthew 5, 11 tells us how the world,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.120]   how the world out there treats a kingdom citizen.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:22.180]   Jesus said, "We will be insulted, persecuted,
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:27.540]   falsely bad mouthed, but that we would be blessed."
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.740]   Jesus then takes it a stage further.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.980]   I put this one on the screen, Matthew 5, 12.
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:38.980]   "Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven.
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:44.860]   For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.460]   who were before you."
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:51.460]   My friends, we are citizens of heaven.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.820]   We are ambassadors of Christ.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.100]   We are heirs of the kingdom of God.
[00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:03.740]   That is because of the work of Jesus on the cross
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.060]   and our faith and belief in Jesus.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.980]   And this brings us to our message for today.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:17.300]   How can I, as a member of Vine Yuan Long,
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:21.380]   how can I, as a citizen of heaven, an ambassador for Christ,
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.460]   an heir of the kingdom of God,
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.500]   contribute to the peace and prosperity of our city?
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.940]   I will tell you.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.960]   I will tell you in 14 words.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:42.660]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:48.020]   You are the light of the world.
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:53.220]   You are salt and light.
[00:50:53.220 --> 00:51:00.340]   This is about our identity in Jesus.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:06.340]   It's not about you trying to be something,
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.100]   but it's about what you are,
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:14.520]   what you already are in Jesus and in his kingdom.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:22.640]   The beauty of the gospel is that God makes us his people
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:28.580]   and he gives us a new identity and a new purpose.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:32.580]   And God calls us to figure out how to work out
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:34.200]   that identity in the world.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.540]   So our identity is in Christ.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:44.380]   Christ, who is the salt of the earth
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.220]   and the light of the world.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:53.220]   And we, in our identity, become that in the world.
[00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:59.620]   Jesus told his disciples that despite the difficulties,
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.840]   despite the persecution,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:05.760]   you are to be the salt and light of the world.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:10.380]   When times are tough, we tend to quit.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:14.220]   We tend to withdraw into our shell.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.740]   We tend to go into our small community
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.360]   and be self-sufficient.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:23.820]   Jesus said, "No, the citizens of my kingdom
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:27.220]   "have an important role to play in this world,
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.980]   "contributing to the peace of our city,
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:35.200]   "even in a world where there can be things
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.020]   "that are against our principles and ethics."
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.880]   Our mission, if you choose to accept it,
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:49.840]   is to be like salt and light in the world.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:53.360]   So let's see this passage in two parts.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.920]   The first one is salt.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.840]   I'll repeat Matthew 13.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.000]   You are the salt of the earth,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.760]   but if salt has lost its taste,
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:07.520]   how should its saltiness be restored?
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.000]   It's no longer good for anything
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.420]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.420]   The first metaphor that Jesus uses
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.420]   for our connection with the world
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.200]   or our engagement with the world
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.800]   is that we are to be salt.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:35.620]   Salt has been used by humanity for over 6,000 years.
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:39.940]   What was the idea of salt
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:43.060]   in the thinking of the ancient world?
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.820]   Well, salt was a very valuable commodity
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:46.660]   in the ancient world.
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:47.740]   It was like money.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.960]   There are records that sometimes at some places,
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.880]   Roman soldiers might receive their pay,
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.020]   their wages, their salary in salt.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:02.020]   That's where the word salary comes from, see?
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:02.860]   Salt.
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.800]   You go to a pay table
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.260]   and they give you a little pouch with a salt.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.160]   That's how valuable and sellable salt
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   was in the ancient world.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   I can think of three major uses of salt.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.200]   Salt as a preservative agent,
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.640]   as a flavoring agent,
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.520]   and as a healing agent.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.020]   Let's take them one at a time.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.920]   Firstly, a preserving agent.
[00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.660]   In the ancient world and even today,
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.500]   salt is used to preserve meat.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.200]   Salted meat and fish became a necessity
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.720]   in the day before the refrigerator was invented.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.800]   The refrigerator's only 200 years old, right?
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.800]   The very basic way is that you could pack it with salt
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.340]   and dry it up so that you could preserve the meat.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.280]   And the idea behind salt
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.160]   is very much about preserving influence.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:17.360]   Christians are to serve as a preserving influence
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:19.500]   in the world against decay.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.440]   That's what Jesus is saying to his disciples.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.940]   You are to be like a preservative in the world.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:34.000]   If the world around you is wicked, arrogant, and sinful,
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.280]   the believers in its midst must act like a preservative
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.880]   and make it slow down in its progress to decay.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.620]   We should make the world better.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:53.620]   There's something distinct about us.
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.960]   God's goodness in us
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:02.200]   protects us against the decay of the world.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:08.960]   At the cross, Jesus defeated death
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   and the system of the world.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   Now we become a preserving factor for goodness.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.400]   I mean, take a look around you.
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.080]   Do you see the growing trend
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:27.760]   towards dishonesty, corruption, immorality,
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.360]   violence, pornography,
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.160]   and the diminishing respect for human life?
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.900]   Whose fault is it?
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.920]   Let me put it this way.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.460]   If meat goes bad,
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.300]   it's no point in blaming the meat.
[00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:48.520]   That is what happens when bacteria
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.680]   are allowed to breed unchecked.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:55.040]   The question to ask is, where is the salt?
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:57:00.380]   My question to you this morning,
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:04.400]   where is the salt?
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:11.100]   Salt is also a flavoring agent.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:14.180]   Salt is used to season our food.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.700]   Some of you, I've seen you,
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:20.400]   you love your salt like anything.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.540]   I see people salt their food
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.400]   before they even taste it, right?
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.700]   I'm British, right?
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.980]   We love fish and chips.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.880]   But the best bit of fish and chips
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.420]   is actually the salt and the vinegar.
[00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:36.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.780]   Of course.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:43.700]   Salt greatly enhances the flavor of the food.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:47.000]   We're supposed to be there to make society better.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.100]   The world is supposed to be better
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:52.400]   because of the fact that the disciples of Jesus are in it.
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.740]   Sometimes the world doesn't understand that.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:57.920]   It often persecutes believers.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.460]   My friends,
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:05.120]   there is no area of your life
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.480]   that Jesus doesn't come into.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.360]   He comes into your personal life,
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.360]   your family life, your professional life,
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.360]   your relationship with others,
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.360]   and in all those relationships,
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:22.260]   you are a preservative against corruption of the world.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:27.640]   You must be a flavoring in your workplace.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.480]   You must be a flavoring in your schools and colleges.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.840]   Christians must be the salt in hospitals
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.320]   and other workplaces.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:43.880]   But lastly, salt is a healing agent.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:49.560]   Universally, salt is seen as a healing agent.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.400]   The use of salt and salt water
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.160]   can be traced right the way back
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.640]   to Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians,
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.560]   all of whom used it to treat cuts,
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:03.040]   wounds, and skin irritations.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.140]   Today, thousands of years later,
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:11.140]   a concentrated form of salt water is called saline, right,
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:15.640]   and is routinely used in medical.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.220]   Saline is sterile.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:21.940]   Oh, there's so much hurt, you know.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:24.420]   Mistrust in our world today.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.660]   Our world is polarized, right?
[00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:31.080]   Democrats or Republicans.
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.220]   Even here, right, yellows and blues.
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.840]   Even in churches,
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:42.680]   division between Protestants and Catholics.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.120]   Local and international churches.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:49.720]   Denominations, charismatics and evangelicals,
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.020]   whatever those words mean.
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:54.720]   I wanna make a declaration today.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.040]   I'm declaring it over this church.
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.680]   I declare that the Vine Yuen Long
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.080]   is a bridge-building community.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.080]   Can I hear amen?
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:03.920]   - Amen.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.640]   - A tearer down of walls.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:13.280]   God's healing agent.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.560]   Salt.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.040]   We serve as the preserving agent,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:24.220]   the flavoring agent, and the healing agent to the world.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.260]   Now let's move from salt to light.
[01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.620]   It's interesting.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.120]   We are the light of the world.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.780]   Go right to the beginning of your Bible.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.340]   I mean, people don't carry Bibles so much these days,
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.940]   but you look, you know, go right to the beginning.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.380]   Genesis chapter one.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.520]   You know, iPhones are safe.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.220]   Genesis one, in the beginning.
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.420]   Right, first words.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:50.420]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.580]   Now the earth was formless and empty.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.340]   Darkness was over the surface of the deep,
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:59.180]   and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.140]   And God said, the first thing we see recorded
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:07.820]   that God said was this, "Let there be light."
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.020]   And there was light.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.260]   And God saw that the light was good,
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:18.940]   and he separated the light from the darkness.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.100]   Can I read some more verses
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.500]   to show you where I'm heading with this?
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.620]   2 Corinthians 4, 6.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:29.620]   For God said, "Let your light shine out of darkness."
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.260]   Made his light shine in our hearts
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.500]   to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.520]   displayed in the face of Christ.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.700]   1 John 1, 5.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.960]   God is light.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.580]   In him, there is no darkness at all.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.380]   And then Jesus, in 8, 12, said this.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.500]   "I am the light of the world."
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.340]   One of the seven I am's, right?
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.740]   I am the light of the world.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.140]   So God is the light.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:02.300]   Jesus is the light of the world.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.980]   Now Jesus looks at his followers.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.900]   He looks at you.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.420]   You are the light of the world.
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.900]   Jesus is saying, "Just like I shine in the world,
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.020]   now I want you to shine in the world."
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.460]   And Matthew 5, 14, which we read earlier,
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:25.100]   you are the light of the world.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.860]   Believers are the light of the world.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.900]   This is hard to imagine.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.880]   Like Jesus said these seven I am's, right?
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:37.700]   But the only I am that he said you are is light.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:42.340]   Jesus don't say, "Hey, Kieran, you're the good shepherd."
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.740]   Or, you know, "You're the way, the truth, and the life."
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:52.740]   But he does say, "I am the light of the world."
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:56.340]   And he then says, "You are the light of the world."
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.460]   This is a great compliment,
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:01.640]   but also a great responsibility.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:07.720]   That is a powerful declaration of the individual worth
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.260]   and mission of every believer.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.420]   Can we just stop and reflect on that a moment?
[01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.580]   It's just so important.
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:20.380]   Jesus who said, "I am the light of the world,"
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.500]   then says, "Chapman, you are the light of the world."
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.140]   That's a responsibility and a privilege, I tell you.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:33.120]   Light is visibility and radiance.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.220]   Let's go back on these verses again.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:40.460]   You are the light of the world.
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:46.580]   A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.700]   Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.420]   Instead, they put it in the stand
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.260]   and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:59.260]   In the same way, let your light shine before others
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.620]   that they might see your good deeds
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.740]   and glorify your Father in heaven.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.100]   Just four things in that verse is,
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.140]   we are the light of the world.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.260]   We are a city on a hill.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.460]   We are to be visible.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.260]   And our visibility is done by action.
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.420]   Good deeds.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:24.220]   To come into the light means to come out of hiding.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.300]   We are to be visible in society
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.060]   with the light of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.780]   The light is the gospel.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:36.900]   The gospel has to radiate from our lives.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.820]   When your light shines,
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.020]   some will accept and turn to the Father,
[01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:43.660]   but some will reject us.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.140]   But if we're neutral,
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:50.900]   something is wrong with our Christian effectiveness.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:55.420]   Our good deeds must radiate from us.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:05:01.980]   What great responsibility has been given to us?
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:05.820]   There is not another light
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:08.180]   that Jesus is shining in the world.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.500]   You.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.620]   You.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.740]   Are the light of the world.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.020]   Jesus said, "I want you to be my light.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.380]   "I want you to be my instrument.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.380]   "You are like my body, my hands and my mouth
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.780]   "and my feet on this earth.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:30.140]   "You are the light of the world."
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.540]   And we are called to keep that light burning.
[01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:36.300]   I mean, think about life in Jesus' time.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.900]   They didn't have any artificial light
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.620]   like we do today, right?
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.580]   You know, they had oil lamps.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:44.940]   You know, every house had an oil lamp.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.580]   And these are the kind of lights
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.100]   that Jesus is talking about.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:52.060]   You are the light of the world.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.860]   Now, individually, one of these might not be too bright,
[01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:02.180]   but vine yun long.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.540]   I believe together,
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.580]   together,
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:09.860]   we can light up the entire area.
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.740]   Oil is a biblical symbol of the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:20.060]   We are to be like the wise bridesmaids
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.180]   who had their lamps full,
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:27.540]   full of oil and full of the Holy Spirit
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.220]   rather than the foolish ones.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:34.420]   But as I draw towards a conclusion,
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.460]   I need to ask you a hard question.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.020]   I'm gonna be straight with you.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:45.700]   If we truly wish to contribute to the peace of our city,
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:50.340]   are we living as the sword of the earth
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.700]   and the light of the world?
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.780]   Or are we living just like the world?
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:07:00.580]   Living in sin, living in flesh?
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:01.860]   I'm not judging, by the way.
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.140]   And the good news is that we can repent
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.980]   and ask for forgiveness.
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:13.980]   But given this chance in 2024,
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:18.780]   let us commit, let's commit together
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:22.460]   that the Vine Church Yun Long will be holy,
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.460]   will be separated and be life and salt.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:29.220]   I will pray for that for us for the moment.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:35.660]   And I want to end on a positive note.
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:41.580]   Some things that we can do to be salt and light.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:47.900]   And the first one is this, share your faith in Christ.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:53.780]   One of the most powerful evangelism tools you have
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:58.780]   is your personal story of coming to faith in Christ.
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:03.020]   What I was like before,
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:08.900]   how I met Christ and the difference He's made to my life.
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:13.020]   Now, unbelievers may not be interested
[01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:18.020]   in discussing Bible verses or spiritual doctrines,
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.580]   but they will likely be willing to hear your story.
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:27.940]   Look for a point of connection with your colleague,
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.540]   your friend or neighbor,
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:33.340]   and share about the difference that you've made.
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:36.980]   The difference that Christ has made in your life.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.980]   No one can argue with that.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:43.620]   For the more shy.
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.140]   Can I encourage you?
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.460]   It's not about preaching.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:52.380]   Some words which were wrongly attributed
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.860]   to Francis of Assisi said,
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:57.260]   "Preach the gospel at all times.
[01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.940]   "Use words if necessary."
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:05.940]   My personal story is that I actually reached
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:10.940]   more people for Christ when I was in the insurance business
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.980]   than I do as a pastor.
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:17.300]   You see, I spent most of my time now with Christians,
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:23.460]   but I didn't stand on my desk and preach a sermon.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:27.620]   I didn't give out tracts and text the whole time.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:31.060]   I didn't preach the whole time
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.500]   or invite them to church every five minutes.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:40.980]   No, but they knew that my door was always open to them.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:47.060]   It was the way I treated them.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:51.700]   The smile, let's have a practice, come on.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:57.420]   The words of encouragement.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:02.980]   That supportive text or email, very easy to do, right?
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:06.580]   That offer to pray for them
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.660]   when they were going through a tough time.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:12.340]   It's funny though, sometimes on the side there,
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:16.060]   you know, I should say, I'll pray for you about that.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.700]   They say, "Oh, yes, yes, yes."
[01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.140]   And they're thinking I'm gonna pray for them
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.460]   when I get home, you know?
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.220]   I say, "Come on then, let's pray."
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.740]   We can all do that.
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:30.100]   Second thing is take your light where it's dark.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.740]   A young girl once consulted with her pastor.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:37.140]   She's, "I can't stick it out any longer.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:40.580]   I'm the only Christian in my company where I work.
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:43.860]   I get nothing but taunts and sneers.
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:46.700]   It's more than I can stand, I'm gonna resign."
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:53.340]   The pastor said, "Will you tell me where lights are placed?"
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:55.860]   She, "What's this got to do with it?"
[01:10:56.860 --> 01:11:01.340]   "Nevermind," the pastor said, "answer my question.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.140]   Where are lights placed?"
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.820]   "I suppose," she said, "in dark places."
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.820]   He said, "Yes, and that's why you have been put
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:15.460]   in a company with such spiritual darkness
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:19.140]   and where there is no other Christian to shine for the Lord."
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:21.220]   The young Christian realized for the first time
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.580]   the opportunity that was hers.
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.420]   She felt that she could not fail God
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:28.500]   by allowing her light to go out.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.980]   She went back to the factory, to the office
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.740]   with renewed determination to let her light shine
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.980]   in a dark corner.
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.820]   Before long, she was the means
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.740]   of leading nine other girls to the Lord.
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:49.980]   And lastly, shine together as the torch.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:55.500]   If we were to turn the lights out here today,
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.540]   and it was in darkness, and I got my iPhone out
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:02.620]   and put my torch on, that would be light in the darkness,
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.380]   but it wouldn't be very powerful.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.580]   If we were all to take our iPhones out
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.500]   and all put our torches on, sorry,
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.420]   I didn't mean to advertise for Apple.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:16.300]   If we would take our smartphones out,
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.540]   if we would take our smartphones out
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:23.020]   and all put our torch on, it would make a difference.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.220]   That is such a picture.
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:30.020]   What strikes me about Vian Yuen Long
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.740]   and why Sandra and I love coming here is this.
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:37.620]   You are a community.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:41.500]   You are a community.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:47.820]   And the word unity is a big part of community.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.820]   Community.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:56.140]   Let us resolve to shine our torches together.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:01.940]   That the lights are on at Vian Yuen Long 24/7.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:04.020]   I'm not talking about Hongshan Lee building,
[01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.860]   the election bill would be rather pathetic,
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.860]   but our lights are on 24/7.
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:15.660]   Let us commit to being salt and light.
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.380]   I believe that this is the key to contributing
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.580]   to the peace and the prosperity of our city.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:31.380]   As I close, I believe there will be
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:35.700]   a number of significant shifts.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:41.060]   I see this prophetically, and please weigh this up.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.180]   I see a spiritual earthquake.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:52.660]   In the natural, as what are called tectonic plates
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:56.060]   interact with each other, energy is released
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:00.340]   as seismic waves causing the ground to shake.
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:05.060]   This is an earthquake.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:11.860]   I see a spiritual earthquake.
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:16.700]   And in this spiritual earthquake, I believe we'll see the following.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:23.580]   Firstly, we will see service, not selfishness.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:27.860]   Can I repeat that?
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:31.180]   Service.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.260]   Oh, pastor, I'm leaving the church.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.780]   I'm not getting fed.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:39.420]   You heard that so many times, right?
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.420]   It's all about me, me, me, me, me.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.620]   Selfishness.
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.140]   Service, not selfishness.
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:52.900]   Living our lives for each other and the community at large
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:57.540]   at the expense of worrying about our own individual needs
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.540]   or even the needs of just our church.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:04.380]   Philippians 2, 3 says this,
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:10.380]   "Be humble, thinking of others as better than ourselves."
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:15.660]   I believe we will see as part of this spiritual earthquake
[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:17.260]   a healed community.
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:20.820]   A healed community.
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:28.220]   To show how ethnic, political, generational separation
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.980]   and division can be healed in this community.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:32.980]   Look at us.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.980]   Just take a look around the church.
[01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:36.980]   We're a diverse bunch.
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.980]   Different races.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.980]   Different colour faces.
[01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.980]   Different backgrounds.
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.980]   Different first languages.
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.980]   In a world that is divided,
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:58.980]   with societies and families becoming even more polarised,
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:02.980]   we can become a major contribution
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.980]   in the unity part of our community.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:11.980]   And lastly, we will be carriers of hope.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.980]   Carriers of hope.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:19.980]   I mean, just read your newspapers.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.980]   Hope.
[01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:23.980]   Seems nowhere to be found these days.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.980]   Instead of saying, "We're going to be a community,
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:31.980]   instead of cynicism and despair,
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:36.980]   we carry real hope even in the midst of disorientation.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:40.980]   Even in the midst of pain in our city."
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:43.980]   Tim called it out last week.
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.980]   He stated it clearly.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.980]   Fear.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   Fear has become a giant in our city.
[01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:59.980]   And its people are gripped by it.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:03.980]   And are desperately lacking in hope.
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:06.980]   Especially our young people.
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:13.980]   Our contribution is hope.
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.980]   Because of what the Bible describes as Christ in you,
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:19.980]   the hope of glory.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:23.980]   We are the hope for this city
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.980]   because Christ is the hope for our city.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:31.980]   And we just don't take care of our own tribe.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:37.980]   We also do work for the peace, the security, the justice
[01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.980]   and the prosperity of our neighbours.
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:43.980]   Loving them in word and deed.
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:48.980]   Whether or not they believe the same thing
[01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.980]   as we believe.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.980]   Vine, you're love.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:58.980]   I bless you.
[01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:01.980]   I bless you.
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:03.980]   To be salt.
[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.980]   And to be light.
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.980]   Would you stand up? I'd love to pray for you as the band comes back.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.980]   I bless you.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:28.980]   Would you just put your hands out in front of you please?
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.980]   This is not a religious thing that we do.
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.980]   It's just to say to God I'm open to what you have.
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:36.980]   I think the word that came pretty early on in there
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:38.980]   and I've got to deal with it
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.980]   is repent.
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:45.980]   We're all sinners.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:51.980]   And before we talk about going out to the world out there
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.980]   and doing all these wonderful things,
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:56.980]   let's just come before God.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.980]   Say Jesus Christ,
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.980]   I believe you're the Son of God.
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.980]   Jesus Christ, I believe you died for my sins.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.980]   Jesus, forgive my sins and
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:10.980]   come into my life by your Holy Spirit.
[01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:16.980]   Lord, I choose today to repent of all my wrongdoings,
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:18.980]   my wrong attitudes,
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.980]   my biases towards people.
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:27.980]   Forgive me, Lord.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.980]   And use me.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.980]   And Lord, together, Lord,
[01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:40.980]   we ask for an anointing to be upon this church.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:44.980]   A fresh anointing.
[01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:50.980]   Hong Kong doesn't need another church.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.980]   There are plenty of churches in Hong Kong.
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:57.980]   But Hong Kong and Yuen Long in this area
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:01.980]   needs a church who are willing to be salt and light for him.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.980]   My friend, that's a sacrifice.
[01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:10.980]   I know when you go home today,
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.980]   you say that was a good sermon, it tickled your ear.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:15.980]   And you get on with life and you live life as normal.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:19.980]   Being salt and light means living differently.
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:24.980]   Being salt and light means having different priorities.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:28.980]   It means treating people differently.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:34.980]   For some of you, it means looking at your workplace colleagues differently.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   Your neighbors.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:45.980]   Holy Spirit,
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:52.980]   think of that old song, "Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning."
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.980]   That's what I want to pray.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:57.980]   Lord, that you would fill our lamps with oil
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.980]   and keep them burning bright for you.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   I confess, Lord, I want to be salt and light,
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.980]   but so many times, Lord, I fail you.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:17.980]   Lord, I pray today
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   that you will help me.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.980]   Help me.
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:29.980]   Help me to be salt and light.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:35.980]   I wonder if you just join hands across the congregation,
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.980]   I want to pray for us together.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:42.980]   Just join hands together if we can.
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:50.980]   Because I believe this is something we need to pray for collectively.
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:59.980]   Buying you long is just not to be an alternative place to come to on a Sunday morning
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.980]   because one shy is too far on the MTR.
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:08.980]   God has ordained this place for a purpose,
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.980]   to be salt and light in this community.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:16.980]   But we have to do this together.
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:20.980]   Join us together, Lord,
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.980]   as your people.
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:29.980]   We pray now for the people of Yuen Long.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:32.980]   We pray now for the people of Hong Kong.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:37.980]   Help us collectively, Lord,
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:44.980]   to be years by years,
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   and for your glory.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.980]   Holy Spirit.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.980]   I want to see the Holy Spirit just,
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.980]   this is like an electric current as we're going around,
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:56.980]   we're joined together.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.980]   Holy Spirit just flowing through us.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:02.980]   Flowing for you onto the person next to you,
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.980]   and vice versa.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.980]   Holy Spirit, come.
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.980]   Fill me afresh.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.980]   I surrender to you now.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:16.980]   Use me for your glory, Lord, to be salt
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:20.980]   and light.
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:27.980]   We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are
[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:31.980]   the way maker,
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:34.980]   the miracle worker.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.980]   the way maker, the miracle worker.
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.980]   Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.
[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.980]   We pray this, and Lord, we declare that you are

[01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.980]   He is our life.
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:00.980]   He is our everything.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   And so, Father,
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.980]   we proclaim you in our lives.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.980]   And, Father, we just declare today
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:12.980]   that we are your light.
[01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   We are your salt.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.980]   Church, I just want to pray over you.
[01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.980]   I want to pray over us, that even on our worst days,
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:24.980]   when you don't want to do anything,
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:26.980]   you want to just lie in bed,
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.980]   you just don't want to do anything, you don't want to see anyone,
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.980]   you know what? You are still salt. You are still light.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:35.980]   And God is still at work, just as we're singing.
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   Even when I don't feel it, even when I don't see it,
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:41.980]   you are working, Lord. And we say, "Yes, Lord, that is our hope."
[01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:44.980]   Church, that is really our hope today.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:47.980]   And so I want to just bless you and release you
[01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:50.980]   to know every moment you are shining.
[01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:53.980]   You are bringing flavor.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:55.980]   You are proclaiming and pointing others to God's goodness
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.980]   in you and in us, even though we don't feel that way.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.980]   We don't believe that all the time.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:04.980]   But the reality is, this is our reality now.
[01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:07.980]   And so, Jesus, we thank you
[01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.980]   that you call us a sinful, selfish people
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:13.980]   to serve you, to love you,
[01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:16.980]   to reveal you through us.
[01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.980]   And you are changing us. You are transforming us.
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.980]   We don't deserve it, but you are.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:24.980]   And we thank you for your mercy.
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:27.980]   We thank you for your grace.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:30.980]   And so may we start in our homes.
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:33.980]   May we start in our communities. May we start in our schools,
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:36.980]   knowing that we are always going to be your salt and light.
[01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:40.980]   So, Jesus, we thank you, and we go out in this joy, in this peace.
