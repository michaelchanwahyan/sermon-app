[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   Thank you, Justin.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.880]   That was amazing.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.040]   It's good to be with you this morning on this little cooler morning.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.880]   I am a Hong Konger.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.560]   Hong Kong is Sandra and I's adopted home and has been for the last 37 years.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.040]   Its people are my family.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:43.580]   My sons, their wives, and five grandchildren are also Hong Kongers.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:51.280]   The grandchildren were all made in Hong Kong, well, to my knowledge anyway.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.520]   They were born here, of that I can be sure.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.040]   Don't be put off by my face.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.440]   Yes, I am a guai lou.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.160]   Don't be put off by my lack of Chinese.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.560]   I don't speak Cantonese.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.960]   Well, to be truthful, I speak a little Cantonese.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.840]   I love Hong Kong.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.320]   Tim told us last week that it doesn't matter whether we are an expat, a local, a domestic
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.080]   helper, or an asylum seeker.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.480]   It doesn't matter whether we are a street sleeper or we're chairman of HSBC.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.120]   This is home.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.880]   And Tim used a famous passage in Jeremiah 29 to tell us.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.480]   Yes, as he said, it does contain the famous 2911 fridge magnet bookmark photo frame verse.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.440]   To seek the peace and prosperity of the city.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.520]   He reminded us that this word of God was given to a people in exile.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:28.880]   The Israelites who spent 70 years, yes, 70 years as strangers and aliens in Babylon.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.720]   Tim used this to challenge us to become engaged in our city.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.640]   But there was no excuse for apathetic disengagement.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.720]   But if that was the what, today I want to look at the how.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.840]   How can I as an expat, a domestic helper, asylum seeker, street sleeper, or chairman
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:10.320]   of HSBC, how can I as a member of Vine, Yuen Long, contribute, contribute to the peace
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.520]   and prosperity of our city?
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.680]   You see, whereas in the first message we looked at how we relate to Hong Kong and Yuen Long
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.600]   from a big picture perspective, this time we want to look in more detail.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.000]   What does it actually mean to love the place we're in and to work for its welfare and peace?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.920]   More especially, how can we use the church's resources, our faith resources to bring flourishing
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.080]   to Yuen Long?
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.080]   How can we use our difference to serve people?
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.880]   Today we will think about our spheres of influence and how we can contribute to the flourishing
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:17.200]   and well-being of Yuen Long and its people so that people will see our good work and
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   praise God in heaven.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.560]   And I'll tell you something.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.840]   I'm going to make it simple.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.520]   So embarrassingly simple.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.200]   To demonstrate, I'm turning to two household items.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.800]   They're actually all in this one thing.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.040]   How can you talk about salt and light and have it in one thing?
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   Look at that.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   Salt and light.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.040]   Press it again.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.120]   Yes.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.320]   Salt and light.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   It's for you, Byron.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   Let's look at scripture.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.920]   Let's turn to Matthew 5.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.720]   Let's start at verse 13.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.720]   You.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720]   Yes, you.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   You.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.820]   Yes, you.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.740]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.780]   But if salt's lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:38.540]   It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.800]   feet.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.180]   You are the light of the world.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.160]   A city set on a hill cannot be hidden, nor do people light a lamp and put it under a
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.880]   basket but on a stand so it gives light to all the house.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:08.240]   In the same way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.540]   and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.540]   Let me start by giving you some background.
[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.320]   This section is from the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.820]   Matthew 5, 6, 7.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.940]   Amazing chapters.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:38.400]   Jesus' audiences were the disciples of Jesus and the crowd who were the future disciples
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   of Jesus.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.280]   And what they were doing, they were weighing the cost of following Jesus.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.980]   And the background to my teaching this morning can be found in Jesus' teaching in the Sermon
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.200]   on the Mount.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.560]   And particularly his teaching on the Kingdom of God also described as the Kingdom of Heaven.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:10.960]   Jesus had told them in Matthew 4 that repentance is the key to entering the Kingdom of Heaven.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.320]   I've put it on the screen.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:22.160]   From that time, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand."
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:32.040]   As the Sermon on the Mount continues, Jesus answers the important question, "Who can enter
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.400]   the Kingdom of Heaven?
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.800]   Who can enter the Kingdom of God?"
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.320]   He answers it with what we call the Beatitudes.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.040]   I heard that Billy Graham had actually called them "beautiful attitudes."
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.000]   I love that.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.240]   I heard a story of a Chinese Christian who came to a missionary one time and said, "I've
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.480]   learned to quote the Sermon on the Mount by memory."
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:06.200]   He stood before the missionary and perfectly quoted the sermon word for word.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.520]   The missionary said, "That's wonderful.
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.680]   How did you do it?"
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:19.720]   The Chinese Christian said this, "I spent the last year trying to live it."
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:26.920]   Matthew 5, 3 to 6 tells us, "It is the poor and spirit, those who mourn, the meek, those
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.880]   who hunger and thirst for righteousness who can enter the Kingdom of God."
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:40.640]   In verses 7 to 9, he then describes the attitude of a Kingdom person as merciful, pure in heart,
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.520]   a peacemaker.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.560]   We are told we will be called children of God.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.920]   All this seems good.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:09:01.960]   But Matthew 5, 11 tells us how the world, how the world out there treats a Kingdom citizen.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   Jesus said we will be insulted, persecuted, falsely bad-mouthed, but that we will be blessed.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.480]   Jesus then takes it a stage further.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.800]   I put this one on the screen.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:25.560]   Matthew 5, 12, "Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.320]   For in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you."
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.160]   My friends, we are citizens of heaven.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.760]   We are ambassadors of Christ.
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.200]   We are heirs of the Kingdom of God.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:53.280]   That is because of the work of Jesus on the cross and our faith and belief in Jesus.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.080]   And this brings us to our message for today.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:05.400]   How can I, as a member of Vine, Ewan Long, how can I, as a citizen of heaven, an ambassador
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   for Christ, an heir of the Kingdom of God, contribute to the peace and prosperity of
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.600]   our city?
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:29.520]   I will tell you in 14 words, you are the salt of the earth.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.960]   You are the light of the world.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.800]   You are salt and light.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.440]   This is about our identity in Jesus.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.200]   It's not about you trying to be something.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:02.500]   But it's about what you are, what you already are in Jesus and in his Kingdom.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:09.580]   The beauty of the gospel is that God makes us his people.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.620]   And he gives us a new identity and a new purpose.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:20.620]   And God calls us to figure out how to work out that identity in the world.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:26.460]   So our identity is in Christ.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:33.220]   Christ, who is the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:41.220]   And we, in our identity, become that in the world.
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:47.340]   Jesus told his disciples that despite the difficulties, despite the persecution, you
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.940]   are to be the salt and light of the world.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.200]   When times are tough, we tend to quit.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.100]   We tend to withdraw into our shell.
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:04.220]   We tend to go into our small community and be self-sufficient.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.740]   Jesus said no.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:12.220]   The citizens of my Kingdom have an important role to play in this world.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.420]   Contributing to the peace of our city.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:25.500]   Even in a world where there can be things that are against our principles and ethics.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:35.820]   Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to be like salt and light in the world.
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.300]   So let's see this passage in two parts.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.460]   The first one is salt.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.840]   I repeat Matthew 13.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.000]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.500]   But if salt has lost its taste, how should its saltiness be restored?
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:58.540]   It's no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.700]   feet.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.380]   You are the salt of the earth.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:11.420]   The first metaphor that Jesus uses for our connection with the world or our engagement
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.060]   with the world is that we are to be salt.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:22.820]   Salt has been used by humanity for over 6,000 years.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:27.420]   What was the idea of salt in the thinking of the ancient world?
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.700]   Well, salt was a very valuable commodity in the ancient world.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.940]   It was like money.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:40.020]   There are records that sometimes in some places, Roman soldiers might receive their pay, their
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.020]   wages, their salary in salt.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:47.860]   That's where the word salary comes from, see?
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.860]   Salt.
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:56.340]   You go to a pay table and they give you a little pouch with a salt.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:03.740]   That's how valuable and sellable salt was in the ancient world.
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.220]   I can think of three major uses of salt.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:17.500]   For as a preservative agent, as a flavoring agent, and as a healing agent.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.180]   Let's take them one at a time.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.540]   Firstly a preserving agent.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.980]   In the ancient world and even today, salt is used to preserve meat.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:38.580]   Salted meat and fish became a necessity in the day before the refrigerator was invented.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.660]   The refrigerator is only 200 years old, right?
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:48.780]   The very basic way is that you could pack it with salt and dry it up so that you could
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.300]   preserve the meat.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:58.460]   And the idea behind salt is very much about preserving influence.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:06.140]   Christians are to serve as a preserving influence in the world against decay.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.500]   That's what Jesus is saying to his disciples.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.900]   You are to be like a preservative in the world.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:22.060]   If the world around you is wicked, arrogant, and sinful, the believers in its midst must
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:28.940]   act like a preservative and make it slow down in its progress to decay.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:36.740]   We should make the world better.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.820]   There's something distinct about us.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:48.940]   God's goodness in us protects us against the decay of the world.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:56.920]   At the cross, Jesus defeated death and the system of the world.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.620]   Now we become a preserving factor for goodness.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.260]   I mean, take a look around you.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:15.300]   Do you see the growing trend towards dishonesty, corruption, immorality, violence, pornography,
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.580]   and the diminishing respect for human life?
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.660]   Whose fault is it?
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.900]   Let me put it this way.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.940]   If meat goes bad, there's no point in blaming the meat.
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:36.660]   That is what happens when bacteria are allowed to breed unchecked.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:42.940]   The question to ask is, where is the salt?
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:51.860]   My question to you this morning, where is the salt?
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.460]   Salt is also a flavoring agent.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.100]   Salt is used to season our food.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.520]   Some of you, I've seen you.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.460]   You love your salt like anything.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.460]   I see people salt their food before they even taste it, right?
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.220]   I'm British, right?
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.140]   We love fish and chips.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:21.780]   But the best bit of fish and chips is actually the salt and the vinegar.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.540]   Of course.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.660]   Salt greatly enhances the flavor of the food.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.860]   We're supposed to be there to make society better.
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.540]   The world is supposed to be better because of the fact that the disciples of Jesus are
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.720]   in it.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.680]   Sometimes the world doesn't understand that.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.340]   It often persecutes believers.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:52.340]   My friends, there is no area of your life that Jesus doesn't come into.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:58.020]   He comes into your personal life, your family life, your professional life, your relationship
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:06.160]   with others, and in all those relationships, you are a preservative against corruption
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.340]   of the world.
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:14.580]   You must be a flavoring in your workplace.
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.460]   You must be a flavoring in your schools and colleges.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:24.500]   Christians must be the salt in hospitals and other workplaces.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:29.900]   But lastly, salt is a healing agent.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.420]   Universally, salt is seen as a healing agent.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:40.420]   The use of salt and salt water can be traced right the way back to Greeks, Romans, and
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:47.500]   Egyptians, all of whom used it to treat cuts, wounds, and skin irritations.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:56.180]   Today, thousands of years later, a concentrated form of salt water is called saline, right,
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.180]   and is routinely used in medical.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.180]   Saline is sterile.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.980]   Oh, there's so much hurt, you know.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.820]   Distrust in our world today.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.340]   Our world is polarized, right?
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.700]   Democrats or Republicans.
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700]   Even here, right?
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.260]   Yellows and blues.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:27.940]   Even in churches, division between Protestants and Catholics.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.500]   Local and international churches.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.020]   Denominations.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.700]   Charismatics and evangelicals.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.020]   Whatever those words mean.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.380]   I want to make a declaration today.
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.700]   I'm declaring it over this church.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.900]   I declare that the Vine Yuen Long is a bridge-building community.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.660]   Can I hear amen?
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.980]   A terror down of walls.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.820]   God's healing agent.
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.140]   Salt.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.980]   We serve as the preserving agent, the flavoring agent, and the healing agent to the world.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.780]   Now, let's move from salt to light.
[00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.540]   It's interesting.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.980]   We are the light of the world.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.500]   Go right to the beginning of your Bible.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.300]   People don't carry Bibles so much these days.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.780]   Go right to the beginning.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.100]   Genesis chapter 1.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.860]   I want my iPhone to say Genesis 1.
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.860]   In the beginning.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.340]   All right, first words.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.340]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.900]   Now the earth was formless and empty.
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.260]   Darkness was over the surface of the deep.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.140]   And the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:50.060]   And God said, the first thing we see recorded that God said was this.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.940]   Let there be light.
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.940]   And there was light.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.140]   And God saw that the light was good.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.860]   And he separated the light from the darkness.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.380]   Can I read some more verses to show you where I'm heading with this?
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.820]   2 Corinthians 4.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   6.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:15.100]   For God said, let your light shine out of darkness.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:22.340]   Made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.540]   displayed in the face of Christ.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.540]   1 John 1.5.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.900]   God is light.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.940]   In him there is no darkness at all.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.220]   And then Jesus in 8.12 said this.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.380]   I am the light of the world.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.140]   One of the seven I am's, right?
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.700]   I am the light of the world.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.580]   So God is the light.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.700]   Jesus is the light of the world.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.900]   Now Jesus looks at his followers.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.340]   He looks at you.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.460]   You are the light of the world.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.980]   Jesus is saying just like I shine in the world, now I want you to shine in the world.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:11.260]   And Matthew 5.14 which we read earlier, you are the light of the world.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.580]   Believers are the light of the world.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.820]   This is hard to imagine.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.820]   Like Jesus said these seven I am's, right?
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.540]   But the only I am that he said you are is light.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.460]   Jesus doesn't say hey, Kieran, you're the good shepherd.
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:31.380]   Or you're the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:37.700]   But he does say I am the light of the world.
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.300]   And he then says you are the light of the world.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.380]   This is a great compliment.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.780]   But also a great responsibility.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:55.340]   That is a powerful declaration of the individual worth and mission of every believer.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.300]   Can we just stop and reflect on that a moment?
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.300]   It's so important.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.340]   Jesus who said I am the light of the world.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.500]   Then says Chapman, you are the light of the world.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.300]   That's a responsibility and a privilege, I tell you.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.900]   Light is visibility and radiance.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.420]   Let's go back on these verses again.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.420]   You are the light of the world.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.500]   A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.060]   Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:40.220]   Instead they put it in the stand and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:46.420]   In the same way, let your light shine before others that they might see your good deeds
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.700]   and glorify your father in heaven.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.100]   Just four things in that verse.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.220]   We are the light of the world.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.340]   We are a city on a hill.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.460]   We are to be visible.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:04.660]   And our visibility is done by action, good deeds.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:11.220]   To come into the light means to come out of hiding.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.940]   We are to be visible in society with the light of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.020]   The light is the gospel.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.900]   The gospel has to radiate from our lives.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:29.620]   When your light shines, some will accept and turn to the father, but some will reject us.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:37.060]   But if we're neutral, something is wrong with our Christian effectiveness.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:41.980]   Our good deeds must radiate from us.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:48.460]   What great responsibility has been given to us.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:55.860]   There is not another light that Jesus is shining in the world.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.540]   You, you are the light of the world.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.780]   Jesus said, I want you to be my light.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.580]   I want you to be my instrument.
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.900]   You are like my body, my hands and my mouth and my feet on this earth.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.340]   You are the light of the world.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.620]   And we are called to keep that light burning.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.540]   I mean, think about life in Jesus' time.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.460]   They didn't have any artificial light like we do today, right?
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.420]   You know, they had oil lamps.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.060]   You know, every house had an oil lamp.
[00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:34.860]   And these are the kind of lights that Jesus is talking about.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.900]   You are the light of the world.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.460]   Now, individually, one of these might not be too bright.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:47.020]   But vine yun long.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:54.420]   I believe together, together, we can light up the entire area.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:01.820]   Oil is a biblical symbol of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.980]   We are to be like the wise bridesmaids who
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:12.380]   had their lamps full, full of oil and full of the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.660]   rather than the foolish ones.
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.460]   But as I draw towards a conclusion,
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.260]   I need to ask you a hard question.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.700]   I'm going to be straight with you.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:31.820]   If we truly wish to contribute to the peace of our city,
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.140]   are we living as the sword of the earth
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.140]   and the light of the world?
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.580]   Or are we living just like the world?
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:45.380]   Living in sin, living in flesh.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.660]   I'm not judging, by the way.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:52.540]   And the good news is that we can repent and ask for forgiveness.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:27:03.340]   But given this chance in 2024, let us commit.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.980]   Let's commit together that the Vine Church, yun long,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:13.940]   will be holy, will be separated, and be life and salt.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.820]   I will pray for that for us for in a moment.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:23.660]   And I want to end on a positive note.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:30.380]   Some things that we can do to be salt and light.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:36.620]   And the first one is this, share your faith in Christ.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.940]   One of the most powerful evangelism tools you have
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.900]   is your personal story of coming to faith in Christ.
[00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:53.860]   What I was like before, how I met Christ, and the difference
[00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:57.220]   he's made to my life.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.860]   Now, unbelievers may not be interested in discussing
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.820]   Bible verses or spiritual doctrines.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.020]   But they will likely be willing to hear your story.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.940]   Look for a point of connection with your colleague,
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.260]   your friend, or neighbor, and share about the difference
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.820]   that Christ has made in your life.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.540]   No one can argue with that.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:32.020]   For the more shy, can I encourage you?
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:35.180]   It's not about preaching.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.180]   Some words which were wrongly attributed
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.340]   to Francis of Assisi said preach the gospel
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.140]   at all times.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.500]   Use words if necessary.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:51.860]   My personal story is that I actually
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.420]   reached more people for Christ when
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.340]   I was in the insurance business than I do as a pastor.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.380]   You see, I spend most of my time now with Christians.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.260]   But I didn't stand on my desk and preach a sermon.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.860]   I didn't give out tracts and text the whole time
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.780]   or invite them to church every five minutes.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.060]   No.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.900]   But they knew that my door was always open to them.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.620]   It was the way I treated them.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.100]   The smile.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.060]   Let's have a practice.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:44.060]   The words of encouragement.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:49.300]   That supportive text or email-- very easy to do, right?
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.780]   That offer to pray for them when they were
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.980]   going through a tough time.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.300]   It's funny, though.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.820]   Sometimes on the side there, I should say,
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.020]   I'll pray for you about that.
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.540]   They say, oh, yes, yes, yes.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.980]   And they're thinking I'm going to pray for them
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.700]   when I get home.
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.860]   And I say, come on, then.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.060]   Let's pray.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.300]   We can all do that.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:16.300]   Second thing is take your light where it's dark.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.540]   A young girl once consulted with her pastor.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.980]   She said, I can't stick it out any longer.
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.420]   I'm the only Christian in my company where I work.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.700]   I get nothing but taunts and sneers.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.380]   It's more than I can stand.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.180]   I'm going to resign.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:38.620]   The pastor said, will you tell me where lights are placed?
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.860]   She said, what's this got to do with it?
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.460]   Never mind, the pastor said.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.180]   Answer my question.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.100]   Where are lights placed?
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:54.220]   I suppose, she said, in dark places.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.060]   He said, yes.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.300]   And that's why you have been put in a company
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.580]   with such spiritual darkness and where
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.940]   there is no other Christian to shine for the Lord.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.020]   The young Christian realized for the first time
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.380]   the opportunity that was hers.
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.940]   She felt that she could not fail God by allowing
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.300]   her light to go out.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.780]   She went back to the factory, to the office,
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.020]   with renewed determination to let her light
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.980]   shine in a dark corner.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.620]   And before long, she was the means
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:29.780]   of leading nine other girls to the Lord.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:37.820]   And lastly, shine together as the torch.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.340]   If we were to turn the lights out here today,
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.540]   and it was in darkness, and I got my iPhone out and put
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.820]   my torch on, that would be light in the darkness,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.220]   but it wouldn't be very powerful.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.660]   If we were all to take our iPhones out and all
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.980]   put our torches on--
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.260]   sorry, I didn't mean to advertise for Apple.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.940]   If we would take our smartphones out,
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:06.180]   if we would take our smartphones out and all put our torch on,
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.820]   it would make a difference.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.820]   That is such a picture.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.860]   What strikes me about Vian Yuen Long
[00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:20.340]   and why Sandra and I love coming here is this.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:24.300]   You are a community.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.660]   You are a community.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:33.420]   And the word unity is a big part of community.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:42.300]   Let us resolve to shine our torches together.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.620]   That the lights are on at Vian Yuen Long 24/7.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.540]   I'm not talking about Huggs, John Lee building.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.660]   The election bill would be rather pathetic.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:56.180]   But our lights are on 24/7.
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:01.460]   Let us commit to being salt and light.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.220]   I believe that this is the key to contributing
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.180]   to the peace and the prosperity of our city.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:16.220]   As I close, I believe there will be
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.260]   a number of significant shifts.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.500]   I see this prophetically.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.580]   And please weigh this up.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.420]   I see a spiritual earthquake.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:37.460]   In the natural, as what are called tectonic plates
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.020]   interact with each other, energy is
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.500]   released as seismic waves causing the ground to shake.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:51.700]   This is an earthquake.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:57.820]   I see a spiritual earthquake.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.540]   And in this spiritual earthquake,
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.220]   I believe we'll see the following.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:11.980]   Firstly, we will see service, not selfishness.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.260]   Can I repeat that?
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:15.760]   Service.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:21.420]   Oh, pastor, I'm leaving the church.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.940]   I'm not getting fed.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.580]   You heard that so many times, right?
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.660]   All about me, me, me, me, me.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.420]   Selfishness.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.420]   Service, not selfishness.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.740]   Living our lives for each other and the community at large,
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:42.340]   at the expense of worrying about our own individual needs,
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.660]   or even the needs of just our church.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.180]   Philippians 2, 3 says this.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.220]   Be humble.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:56.700]   Thinking of others as better than ourselves.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.500]   I believe we will see as part of this spiritual earthquake
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:06.820]   a healed community, a healed community,
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:13.020]   to show how ethnic, political, generational separation
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.500]   and division can be healed in this community.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.100]   Look at us.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.820]   Just take a look around the church.
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.020]   We're a diverse bunch.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:35.660]   Different races, different color faces, different backgrounds,
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.620]   different first languages.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:43.420]   In a world that is divided, with societies and families becoming
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:50.940]   even more polarized, we can become a major contribution
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.100]   in the unity part of our community.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:01.620]   And lastly, we will be carriers of hope.
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.620]   Carriers of hope.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.060]   I mean, just read your newspapers.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:13.140]   Hope seems nowhere to be found these days.
[00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:19.660]   Instead of cynicism and despair, we carry real hope,
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:23.060]   even in the midst of disorientation,
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.180]   even in the midst of pain in our city.
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.700]   Tim called it out last week.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.500]   He stated it clearly.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.940]   Fear.
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:39.420]   Fear has become a giant in our city.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.260]   And its people are gripped by it and are desperately
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:51.300]   lacking in hope, especially our young people.
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:37:01.940]   Our contribution is hope because of what the Bible describes
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:05.740]   as Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.260]   We are the hope for this city because Christ
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.900]   is the hope for our city.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.900]   And we just don't take care of our own tribe.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.780]   We also do work for the peace, the security, the justice,
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.380]   and the prosperity of our neighbors,
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:32.100]   loving them in word and deed, whether or not
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:37.420]   they believe the same thing as we believe.
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:42.140]   Vine, you're love.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.820]   I bless you.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:50.820]   I bless you to be salt and to be light.
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.660]   Would you stand up?
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.700]   I'd love to pray for you as the band comes back.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:14.060]   Will you just put your hands out in front of you, please?
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.700]   This is not a religious thing that we do.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.740]   It's just to say to God, I'm open to what you have.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.940]   I think the word that came pretty early on in there,
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:25.700]   and I've got to deal with it, is repent.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.180]   We're all sinners.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   And before we talk about going out to the world out there
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.220]   and doing all these wonderful things,
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.780]   let's just come before God.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.620]   Say, Jesus Christ, I believe you're the Son of God.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.580]   Jesus Christ, I believe you died for my sins.
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.140]   Jesus, forgive my sins and come into my life
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.980]   by your Holy Spirit.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:39:02.340]   Lord, I choose today to repent of all my wrongdoings,
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:06.860]   my wrong attitudes, my biases towards people.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:14.820]   Forgive me, Lord, and use me.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:24.620]   And Lord, together, Lord, we ask for an anointing
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.980]   to be upon this church, a fresh anointing.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:36.420]   Hong Kong doesn't need another church.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.700]   There are plenty of churches in Hong Kong.
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.020]   But Hong Kong and Yuen Long in this area
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.300]   needs a church who are willing to be salt and light for him.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:52.220]   My friend, that's a sacrifice.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:57.980]   I know when you go home today, yeah,
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.460]   say that was a good sermon, it tickles your ear,
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.900]   and you get on with life, and you live life as normal.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.780]   Being salt and light means living differently.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:13.820]   Being salt and light means having different priorities.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.980]   It means treating people differently.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:21.940]   For some of you, it means looking at your workplace
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.460]   colleagues differently, your neighbors.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:37.380]   Holy Spirit, think of that old song,
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.780]   "Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning."
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.260]   That's what I want to pray, Lord,
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.500]   that you would fill our lamps with oil
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.340]   and keep them burning bright for you.
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:56.100]   I confess, Lord, I want to be salt and light,
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.740]   but so many times, Lord, I fail you.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:11.260]   Lord, I pray today that you will help me,
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.420]   help me to be salt and light.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:21.220]   I wonder if you'd just join hands across the congregation.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.620]   I want to pray for us together.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:27.820]   Just join hands together if we can.
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.660]   Because I believe this is something
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.740]   we need to pray for collectively.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:44.060]   Vying Yuen Long is just not to be an alternative place
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.340]   to come to on a Sunday morning
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.940]   because one shy is too far on the MTR.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:54.860]   God has ordained this place for a purpose,
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.420]   to be salt and light in this community.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.540]   But we have to do this together.
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:08.260]   Join us together, Lord, as your people.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:15.260]   We pray now for the people of Yuen Long.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.220]   We pray now for the people of Hong Kong.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:22.900]   Help us collectively, Lord,
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:32.100]   to be used by you and for your glory.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.580]   Holy Spirit.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.340]   And I just see the Holy Spirit just --
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.500]   this is like an electric current as we're going around.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.700]   We're joined together.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.980]   Holy Spirit just flowing through us,
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:50.940]   flowing for you onto the person next to you and vice versa.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.460]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.020]   Fill me afresh.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:59.180]   I surrender to you now.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:04.100]   Use me for your glory, Lord, to be salt and light.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:11.940]   We pray this, and, Lord, we declare
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:18.340]   that you are the waymaker, the miracle worker.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:23.060]   Lord, we cannot do this in our own strength.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.060]   We pray this.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.060]   [music]
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:36.140]   Start to sing, "You are here moving in this place."
