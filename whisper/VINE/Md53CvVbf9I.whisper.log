[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Amen. Amen. Hey, can we thank our worship team as always just for all that they are. Why don't you have a seat?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And my name is Andrew, one of the pastors here, and we're so glad you're here with us. If you're here online, welcome guys.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   If you're here particularly online for the first time, maybe you're checking this out either live right now in this moment,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   or you're watching sometime in the week ahead, we're so glad you're with us as well.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   I am healthy and back. That's nice to know. Thank you so much for, yeah, thank you for your prayers last week.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I had a lip infection. You might notice that there's a little scab on my lip right now. Don't worry, I'm not contagious anymore.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   But I had a really bad lip infection. My lip swelled up like a sausage. It was the most ugliest thing in the world.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And yet I'm back now. My lip is not as swollen. And I'm excited to be with you and to open up a really important topic to us, I think.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I wonder, have you ever had a moment in your life, right, where you're having a conversation with someone,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   and that conversation takes a turn, and maybe the person you're talking to says something,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and it completely changes, shifts your perspective about something.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Have you ever had one of those conversations where somebody says something, and the conversation goes somewhere,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   and suddenly you have a new way of thinking, a new way of understanding something,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   and it shifts the perspective, and it brings in a revolutionary way of thinking about something.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Anybody ever had one of those conversations? Yeah? Just me?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I had one of those conversations just a couple of months ago.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I was talking with a really good friend of mine. Her name's Madeline Miller.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Madeline and her husband, Nick, were a part of the Vine for many years, part of the old-school Vine crowd that were with us back towards the time at the beginning.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And Madeline now currently lives in London with her family, and she's studying right now to become an Anglican priest.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And Madeline and I, we were talking on Zoom recently, and we were talking about a shared topic of passion that we have, which is suffering and faith.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I know it doesn't sound very exciting, right? But we're passionate about this suffering and faith.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And as we were talking about this topic, Madeline says something that completely arrests me.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   She says this. She says, "Have you ever wondered why, when somebody that we know who is grieving,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   and perhaps somebody in their family has passed away or died or something, and we're at the funeral of that person,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   and our friend is really grieving for the person that they've lost, have you ever wondered why is it that we show up and we bring flowers to the funeral?"
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And I thought to myself, I know that that's the practice. Like, I know that's what we do.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Like, if you've ever been to a funeral, I'm a pastor, I've been to quite a few funerals.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I'm sure you guys have been to funerals and memorials. When you do it here in Hong Kong,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   often you go into a funeral home and there's flowers, there's lilies like this all over the room.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Have you ever stopped to wonder, why is it that we have an inclination to bring something like a flower into the moment of somebody's great suffering?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And I had to admit to Madeline that I'd never really thought that one through.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I knew the practice, but I didn't really understand the purpose.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And she said, "Well, I think it's got something to do with the reality that God has designed beauty to come alongside and be a partner with suffering."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   That conversation with Madeline and the subsequent discussion that we had resulted in this two-week series that I'm starting with us here today.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Because I think Madeline is right.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That I think God has designed there to be something significant about beauty and suffering.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I mean, have you ever wondered why?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   In moments of great struggle and trial, in moments of great pain and suffering for our friends,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   we have this innate desire in us, don't we, to do something beautiful for them.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Like to buy a car that has beautiful writing in it, that we write something beautiful to encourage inside.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Or that we want to buy those flowers and we want to go into their hospital room and put that vase of flowers right there by the side of their bed.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Or maybe we want to buy a piece of art and hang it up in a room somewhere.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Or we want to buy some jewelry or something.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   We have this desire to bring beauty into moments of abject pain and hurt and suffering.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And if that is true, that beauty has been designed by God to somehow come alongside and transform and renew the realities of our suffering.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Could it be then, that in this hour here in Hong Kong, in this history moment that we're in in our city,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   a city that is still suffering much, a city that is still wondering what its identity is,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   a city that is still trying to struggle with the mourning and the grief of all the things that have happened.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Could it be that perhaps the one thing Hong Kong needs the most in this hour is more beauty?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Could it actually be that beauty could save the world?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Well, maybe not the kind of beauty that we often think of when we hear that word.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   You know that kind of beauty, right?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   You know the aesthetic, subjective kind of beauty?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   The beauty that gets thrown at us by advertisers and the media,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   and the beauty that seems to fill our social media feeds,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   the beauty that's trying to tell us and shape us and to make us think that this particular look,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   this particular way, this particular trend is what is now deemed and classified as beautiful.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Is it that kind of beauty that can have something to say to suffering?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I don't know, because that beauty for me seems very fickle.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   That beauty seems to be at the whim of everybody's opinion.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   That beauty we've been taught from a very young age is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   In other words, that beauty is defined by the one who defines it.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Like you see something and you define it and declare it beautiful,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   but somebody else might see the very same thing and might see it as ugliness.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Is it really that fickle beauty that could save the world?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I think we see this so much in the art world.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I went on to Google this week and I just looked for a random piece of art,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and here's what I found.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Probably the most famous piece of art that has ever been created.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa in 1517.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   He was painting, apparently, the wife of a merchant.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Her name was Lisa del Giocondo.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   When he showed this painting, when he released this painting,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   it really was a showstopper.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   People were really wondering what this was all about.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   You can still go and see this painting.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I had the privilege on my sabbatical in 2019 to go to the Louvre.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   You queue for hours and you wind yourself up this staircase,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   and you get into this room, and it's a big, massive room,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and you're only allowed to stand about 15 meters away from this painting.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's a pretty small painting.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's like a postage stamp right in front of you, and you're staring at it,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and you're thinking, "Is this what it's all about?"
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Like this?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Is she beautiful?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Some of you in this room might say, "Well, yeah, she is.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   She's a timeless beauty. There's a timelessness.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   There's a wonder to her, her expression, who she is.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   There's lots of questions she raises for us.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah, she's beautiful."
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Some of you in this room might say, "She's beautiful for 1517."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Maybe back then in 1517 to be a bit morose and dark and down
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and not really smile was hot.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Maybe she was hot in 1517.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Or some of you are sitting in the room here, and you're looking at this,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and you're like, "No. She is not beautiful.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   There is nothing beautiful about her at all."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   In fact, there's actually--this is a true story--
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   there's actually a whole group of people in art history
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   who believe that she's so ugly that she cannot be the wife of a prominent merchant,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   and instead Leonardo was actually painting his male apprentice,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   whose name is Salide.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   It's a true story.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So let me ask you a better question.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Is the painting beautiful?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Like is this actual work of art beautiful to you?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And again, some of you in this room would say, "Well, I think it is.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It's a masterpiece."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I mean, look at how Leonardo painted this thing,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   the colors that he brought out, the depth of it, the beautiful shades,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I mean, the brush strokes.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It is an absolute masterpiece.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But some of you, again, like this group of art historians,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   would look at it and go, "Well, you know what?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   There were a lot better pieces that he painted.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   In fact, this is one of the worst things that he ever did."
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And we realize that beauty is so fickle.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's so up to interpretation.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It's so subjective.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   How can this idea of beauty have anything at all
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   to say to the profound universality of suffering,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   suffering that is felt by all of us?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   How can the fickleness of beauty have anything to say to that?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Well, maybe we're actually defining beauty wrong.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Maybe actually the Bible has something to say about beauty
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   that we all need to re-remember.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The Bible actually has a lot to say about the concept of beauty,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   even though we don't preach and teach much about it in our pulpits.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   In fact, beauty is mentioned in Scripture over 1,000 times,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   some 600 times in the Old Testament,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   about 400 times in the New Testament.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   And when it's mentioned, it has very little, often,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   to do with aesthetic, subjective, physical beauty.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   What it's actually much more about
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   is the idea of the description of what feels and what looks
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   and what is beautiful.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's actually to do with something far grander and bigger
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   than just your opinion about something.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   In the last month or so as I was preparing for this series,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I did the hard work of looking at the majority of these references,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and I boiled them all down to two slides.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Are you ready?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   This is beauty in the Old Testament.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   These kinds of words--impressive, glorified, splendor, agreeable,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   this wholeness, coveting, pleasant, goodness, perfection--
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   at the top there, glory.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   The overarching emphasis in the Old Testament about beauty
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   is the idea of the concept of splendor and majesty and wonder and glory.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Like beauty is not subjective aestheticism.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Beauty has something to say or is about something
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   that is objective and in the world.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And often when beauty is spoken about,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   it's directed to the wonder, the glory, the majesty,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   and the splendor of God.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   In the New Testament, a similar theme continues.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And so we see free from defect, agreeable, as it should be,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   radiant, fame, glory, honor, structure, sublime, appropriate,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   lovely, fine.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   The idea here is that things are as they should be.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   In other words, the concept of beauty in Scripture
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   is not about how you feel about looking at something.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   The concept of beauty is whether something is as it was originally created
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and designed to be.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   If it is, then there is beauty in it
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   because it represents something of the way God had always intended for it.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   See, beauty in Scripture is a lot less to do
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   with this idea of physical aestheticness
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   and so much more to do with the concept of glory.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Something is beautiful if it projects beyond itself
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   to some objective divine goodness.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   If our lives project beyond ourselves to some objective, defined, radiant,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   incredible divine goodness,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   then our lives are deemed in God's biblical concept to be beautiful.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And I wonder whether you're going to wake up tomorrow,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   you're going to look in the mirror, and I wonder what you'll see.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Will you see something beautiful as God would declare and design it
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and declare it to be, or will you see something
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   that you see reflected back in you, all the wrinkles,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   all the things that you don't want to see, the excess flab,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   and all of that stuff?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And is that going to actually define who you are?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   The Bible would say that beauty points us to the goodness
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   and the orderness and the shalom and the peace of God.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   This concept is right there at the start of our biblical story.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Genesis 1 and 2 is a story of beauty.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   We see right at the beginning of Genesis 1, there's this devoidness,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   there's this darkness, the world is formless and shapeless.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It's like a void, but we're told that the Holy Spirit
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   is hovering over the shapelessness, the formlessness of darkness,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   waiting to bring it into action.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   And God speaks, and in that speech, the Holy Spirit moves,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   and out of chaos comes some order.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And God creates, and He forms, and He shapes.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And at the end of the first day, He declares something
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   over what He's made.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Do you remember what He declares?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   He says, "It is..."
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Come on.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Those are the people who are on staff who got paid who made that answer.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Come on, guys. Let's go. Sunday School 101.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Sunday School 101. He declares, "It is good."
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Now, when God says, "It is good," at the end of the day of creation,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   He's not making a moral, ethical statement.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   He's not saying, "This is morally good."
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   No. What God is saying is, "There was chaos, formlessness, darkness, void.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Now there's land and water and animals and birds and trees,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   and it's just as I designed it to be.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   This is good."
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   The word "good" there is actually translated in Hebrew, "beauty."
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   This is God saying, "This is beautiful."
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   He's not saying, "Morally good."
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   He's saying, "Wow! Can you check out what I did?"
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   I mean, "This is amazing. It's beautiful."
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Why? Because it was chaotic.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Now it's ordered and structured, and there's life,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   an interrelational relationship in it.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   This is why at the end of the sixth day,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   He creates the pinnacle of His creation, humanity, you and me.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And at the end of that day, He doesn't say, "It's good."
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   He says, "It's very good."
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Like there's an extra emphasis of beauty in humanity.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And you might ask yourself, "Why?" when you look around this room.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And it's because all of us have been made in the image of God.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And what the Bible says in Genesis 1 and 2 is,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   not only has God created a beautiful world,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   He's then created beautiful humanity, and He tells them to do something.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   You remember? He says, "I want you to go now and steward all of creation.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I want you to multiply, fill the earth, and look after all of creation."
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   In other words, you've seen me take nothingness and bring it into orderness.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Now go and look after that creation by partnering with me
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   to continue to bring order and structure and shalom and peace in the world.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   So I want you to know this.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Right at the fabric of what it means for you to be human
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   is to be a purveyor of beauty in the biblical understanding.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Because beauty is this work of taking things that are broken and wrong
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   and messy and suffering and all of that stuff
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   and bringing it into a place of order and goodness and shalom and peace.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And when we as humans participate in that, we are beautiful.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Which is a real problem.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Because in Genesis 3, we have the story of humanity being given the great task
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   of turning the world into more and more beauty.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And what do we do?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Through our own choices, we take order and we move it back into chaos.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   We undo a lot of what God had done right there in Genesis 1 and 2.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   And what was beautiful and right and good and shalom,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   humanity chooses to take back into a place of disarray and chaos.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And from Genesis 4 onwards, the rest of the biblical story
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   is basically God coming again through the work of humanity
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   and eventually through the sending of His Son Jesus
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   to show us this movement once again from chaos into order.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Because that movement beautifies the work of God.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   This is why beauty is about glory.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   This is why humanity has been called to be beautiful.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Not to be aesthetically pleasing.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   But to dedicate our lives to bringing order.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   So, if I was to give you a biblical definition of beauty,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I would say this, beauty is the objective creative force of God
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   to bring order out of chaos.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Think about that for a second.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Beauty is the objective creative force of God to bring order out of chaos.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And we get to see this ultimately in the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Because Jesus, fully human and fully God, comes to this earth
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   and through His life and His death and His resurrection,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   He shows us what it is to actually finally take that chaos
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   and bring it back into order again.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And that through Jesus' work on the cross and the blood that He sheds,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   what He's offering to humanity is to step into that place of beauty.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   To step into that place where the chaos of our own lives
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   and the sin that we struggle with and all the stuff that's going on for us
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   can be exchanged by His mercy and His forgiveness and His salvation
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   so we could know life again.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   The whole biblical journey and the story is one of beauty.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Can beauty save the world?
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Oh, yes, it can.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   And in fact, beauty is currently at work in you.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   This is why when you read all the scripture passages about beauty,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   it's pointing towards this idea of order out of chaos.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Let me give you some quick examples.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   It starts in Isaiah 52 verse 7.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Isaiah 52 verse 7 says, "How beautiful are the feet of Him who brings good news."
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   It's not talking about some aesthetic perfect pedicure.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   It's not saying, "Wow, look at your feet. Aren't they beautiful?"
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   It's saying, "Your feet are bringing good news, the gospel,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   the hope of the life of the world, the idea of order coming out of chaos
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   to anybody who moves on the mountains,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   anybody who moves in their offices, moves in their homes,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   moves in their relationship to offer hope and order and structure
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   and peace and renewal and revival through the hope of Jesus.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   You are beautiful because you're partnering with that movement of God
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   from chaos to order.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   This is why Ecclesiastes in chapter 3 says it this way,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   "He has made everything beautiful in its time
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   for He has set eternity in the human heart."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   God stands over all of time, holds eternity in His hands,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   and He looks at everything, and He says, "I might see some darkness still.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   There might be some shapeless and formlessness,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   but my Holy Spirit is hovering over it right now,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   hovering over your life right now, all the stuff that's going on for you.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   The Holy Spirit is hovering right there, and He's set eternity in our hearts."
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   In other words, we long to be renewed.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   We long. We have that hole in our hearts
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   that longs to say, "I don't want to be a part of this brokenness.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I need salvation. I need redemption. I want life."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And that eternity is set in our hearts, and God stands over that,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   and He says, "It's beautiful because I'm moving you from chaos to order."
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Have a look at what Peter says to the early church.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   "Your beauty should not come from outward appearance,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Rather, it should be that of your inner self,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   the unfading beauty of a gentle and ordered spirit,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   which is of great worth in God's sight."
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Here is beauty, a gentle and ordered--note that word--
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   not chaotic, not stressed out, not causing lots of division,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   not annoying everybody around you, not being that prickly friend,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   actually being ordered, structured, sensible,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   having allowed the Holy Spirit to continue to work on your flaws.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   We know none of us are perfect, but submitting ourselves
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   to the chipping away of the work of the Spirit of God in our lives,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   as we do that, that's beautiful in God's sight
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   because we show something of the beauty of His glory,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   things just as they were designed to be,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   which brings me back to flowers and funerals, to suffering and beauty.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Can suffering change the world?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Can beauty actually have something to say to our brokenness and our pain and our hurt?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Not ascetic, subjective beauty, no,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   but the kind of beauty that the Bible defines as bringing order out of chaos.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   When we take that flower to the funeral, we're not being offensive to those in the room.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   What we're saying is this is a prophetic reminder that the Lord is still at work.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   This is a prophetic reminder to you that it isn't all this brokenness and this hurt and this suffering.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Look at the wonder and the beauty of this flower.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It points to the reality that is beyond the moment being felt now,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   that there is something good in the heart of God, and He is at work.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   We want to give something beautiful to remind ourselves and those around us in the moment.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   It's the hardest moments in life.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   That that suffering is not the full reality.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   There is something else, and beauty has something to say to our suffering.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   This idea is embedded in Scripture so deeply and so beautifully,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   and it's one that I think as Christians, if we begin to reimagine and re-understand,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   that we begin to redefine the world's perspective of beauty into biblical understanding,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   we actually begin to understand the power that God has placed in us by His Spirit to bring hope into the world.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Let me just share one real quick passage with you to give you a sense of this.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   This is from Isaiah 61, verse 3 onwards.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Let me read this to you. Is everybody okay?
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   She's crying out in beauty. That's beauty.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Isaiah 61, verse 3.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   "For the God will provide for those who grieve in Zion,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   for the display of His splendor."
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Or you could say, "a display of His glory."
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   The word there in the Hebrew could be translated,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   "a display of His beauty."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Isaiah is prophesying into Israel at a moment of their history where for 70 years they've been in exile.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   70 years they've been struggling in exile, having been ripped out of their home in Jerusalem,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   many of them killed, now in captivity in Babylon.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And Isaiah writes them in a time of national mourning and grieving.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   In a time where Israel is wondering, "What's next for us?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   How do we change? How do we grow?
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   How do we actually rebuild our relationship with God?"
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And God shows up and He says, "I'm going to do something.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I'm about to act again to take you out of your chaos and bring you back into order."
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And He prophetically declares the start of that with some beautiful imagery.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   He says, "I'm going to replace your ashes for a crown of beauty."
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   There we go. He uses the concept of beauty and suffering,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   and He brings them side by side.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And He says an exchange is about to take place.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   This imagery is important.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   You see, in Israel when you were suffering or you were mourning or grieving in those days,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   you would do it publicly.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So often in our kind of Western and Eastern backgrounds we would do it privately.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   In the Middle Eastern traditions they did it publicly.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And the way they did that was by covering their head with ashes,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   literally like pouring on top of their head, all over their clothes, ashes.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And they would sit often in the center of the town square
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   and they would mourn publicly.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And it was a way of declaring that mourning,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   but it was also a way of inviting others in that community to come and join them in that mourning
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   because the mourning was a community experience.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And the ashes symbolized publicly that mourning was taking place.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And it's like God is saying, "I know in your 70 years of exile, Israel,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   that you're in this time of mourning.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You've got ashes on your head.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   But I'm about to replace those ashes with this idea of a crown of beauty."
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   The Hebrew word there is like a tiara.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   It's actually the idea, and it was used often in Israelite weddings,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   a tiara for the bride in the wedding.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And he says, "Rather than heaping ashes on your head,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I'm going to actually give you a tiara like what you would get at a wedding."
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   In other words, the thing that symbolizes love and life and hope and goodness, beauty.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I'm giving it to you as a replacement for those ashes.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Now, I want you to see something really important here.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   There's a small word.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   It says "instead."
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   He doesn't say, and this is how we so often interpret this passage,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   he doesn't say, "I'm going to take your ashes,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   and I'm going to gather them all up.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   I'm going to shape and mold them.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I'm going to work on them with my hands.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   I'm going to chip away at them,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   and I'm going to create something beautiful out of your ashes."
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   That's often how we translate this passage,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   and I actually do think God works that way.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   There are other biblical passages that show us that work of God
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   to take our brokenness and to reshape and reform it.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   But in this moment, that's not what God's speaking about.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   He doesn't say, "I'm going to gather up your ashes and reshape them."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   He says, "I'm going to completely replace them.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Instead of the ashes gone completely,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I'm going to place on your head a tiara of beauty."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Because beauty has the power to exchange the grip of suffering and death.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Because beauty is about the restoration of order
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   where there has been before chaos.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   This is why at the end of the passage it says
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   that we might then become a display of His splendor.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   There is nothing more beautiful in this world
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   than jars of clay like you and I,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   who can testify to the beauty in us
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   because God has taken some of our chaos,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   and by His grace, He's made it a little bit more ordered.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And this beauty is exchanged
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   because what God is doing here is He's pointing forward prophetically
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   to the work of Jesus on the cross.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Because on the cross, Jesus doesn't gather up all of our sin.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   He doesn't try to reshape it and reform it
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   and chip away at it and kind of go, "Okay, here's you 2.0."
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   On the cross, Jesus exchanges our sin for His liberation and grace.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   He exchanges our death for His life.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   This is why when Paul writes of it, he says,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   "In Christ Jesus, we are new creations."
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Not just a little bit better versions of the old stuff,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   completely made new because there's an exchange that happens on the cross.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   That's the power of the beauty of God.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Are you with me?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   So when God moves in that way, it's an invitation to us
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   to think about our lives and ourselves as these objects
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   and these worth and these movements of beauty
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   that we get to, like it was called in Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   to be purveyors of beauty in our context right now.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And that's very good news, my friends, for Hong Kong.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   See, I think the church in Hong Kong needs to recapture the vision of beauty.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   I think we need to actually begin to gather around ourselves
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and say, "How do we walk and move and live more beautifully in this time
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   than ever before?"
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And those moments where we partner with the Holy Spirit
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   to see little things come into order out of the chaos in our lives
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   are the things that testify most beautifully and powerfully
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   to the glory of God.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So we do this in small and big ways.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Imagine that moment where you're sitting there with your child
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   and your child's hair is all messed up and knotted,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   and you take your hairbrush and you gently and lovingly
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   knot out all of those knots into the straight, beautiful hair.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Guess what? You're ushering in beauty.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Or how about when that broken relationship in your life,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   that you've decided to take the time to humble yourself
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   and work on that relationship to admit where you've been wrong
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   and to ask for forgiveness and to work hard at restoring that relationship,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   you're ushering in beauty.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Or that moment in a business meeting where suddenly you get this revelation,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   this idea, and you get some idea that helps to navigate the company
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   beyond the things that was happening right now
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   and take it into that new place or that new project
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   or begin a new life there, you're ushering in beauty.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Next week, I'm going to take this to the next step and say,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   "What does it actually mean for us to be these ushers of beauty in Hong Kong
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   in this time?"
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   I'm going to share some things next week that will help you to understand
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   what that next step is for you in this area of beauty.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   But before then, tomorrow when you wake up and look in the mirror,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   what are you going to see?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Are you going to see all your wrinkles and imperfections and pimples
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   and excess flab?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Are you going to see just ashes and declare yourself ugly?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Or are you going to be able to stand back from that
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and actually recapture a biblical vision of beauty
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   and say that despite my imperfections, despite that excess flab,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   there is structure and order and shalom and goodness and repentance
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   and renewal and revival and change and restoration going on in my life.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   I am not the same person I was a year ago.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   By the grace of God, that is beautiful.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   That I might see something in my life go from chaos to order.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   But not only that, I might partner with the Holy Spirit to come around
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and see other people in my life move from a place of chaos
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   into a place of order.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   When that takes place, God stands back and He goes,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   "That is very good."
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   I wonder if you'd pray with me. Let's pray.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Father, I thank you for each person in this room.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Lord, I thank you for who we are, the diversity, the uniqueness,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   men and women of Christ, people of yours in this moment.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Father, we come now just before you.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And we know this area of beauty is challenging for each one of us.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   And there are some of us in this room that really struggle with this.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   And maybe you've never even been able to ever look at yourself
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   or declare yourself beautiful.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   But you only ever see the things that you perceive as being wrong with you.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   In some ways, being stuck in Genesis 3,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   taking order and bringing it into chaos again.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Some of you do feel like ashes are over you.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   My prayer for you this morning is that through what we've been sharing,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   there might be a shift for you in how you perceive yourself.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   That you might begin to think of beauty in a different way.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And it will be hard. It will take practice.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Because we're so ingrained in what the world is trying to tell us
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   about aesthetic subjective beauty.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   But you need to know that there is an objective divine goodness
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   and glory and splendor and majesty that is beauty in this world.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And that you, as his beloved child, redeemed by his Savior Jesus,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   given grace and hope in life, you are his work of art.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   You are beautiful.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   And for some of you, that's going to be a liberating idea.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   For some of you, that's hard to receive, but it's still truth.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   And I want to encourage you this week
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   to allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you about yourself.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   How you perceive yourself.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And allow him to begin to show you the ways that he has brought
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   so much order out of the chaos in your life.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And it's easy for us to continue to see chaotic things taking place in our lives.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   But ask him to give you his perspective.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   He has set eternity in your heart.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Ask him to show you where you've come, the journey you've been on.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Who you are today versus who you were five years ago.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And glorify him, worship him because of that.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   That his Spirit has been in work, taking you from chaos to order.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And maybe just this week, it's a chance for you to worship him in a fresh new way.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And perhaps in that, you might begin to then reflect
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   on what we're going to be talking about next week.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   How might you then be partnering with the Spirit of God
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   to see more beauty come in this world?
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   To see more order come in the chaotic things around us?
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   For our city, for our neighborhoods, our communities, for this church.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   How might we begin to live out this call to partner with God
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   to see order come through chaos?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Father, we thank you so much that your power and your presence is with us.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   We thank you that you are shaping and forming each person here.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And we thank you that it is all for your glory.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   You are so beautiful, Lord.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Would you replace our ashes, exchange them for your glory.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Would you stand with me?
