[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320]   Well, welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.920]   Welcome, if you're joining us online,
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.960]   a big welcome to you as well.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.880]   We are in week two of our sermon series in James.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.880]   If you haven't caught up with last week,
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.800]   because we had the typhoon,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.080]   the messages up online,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.980]   Pastor Philip gave a wonderful, beautiful message
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040]   to start us off in this series.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.480]   And so if you haven't checked that out yet,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.720]   I highly encourage you to do so,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.160]   and so we can continue on our journey today.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.240]   So James chapter two, if you have a Bible,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.880]   you can keep that open.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.640]   We're gonna be reading through the passage together.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.280]   So one thing I figured out about myself
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.160]   is that people have a hard time
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.320]   sort of placing where I'm from.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.240]   Right, so for example,
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.000]   and I just got back from visiting my wife's family
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.200]   in Northeast Texas, small town there,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.880]   but every time I'm there,
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.600]   inevitably people mistake me for being Mexican, right?
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.500]   'Cause there's not very many Asian people there, right?
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.280]   And because of my complexion, I tan very, very easily.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.040]   In fact, let me show you a picture right now, okay?
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.080]   So take a look at this picture, okay?
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.680]   Can you tell me what that is?
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.080]   Right, so that is my arm next to my wife's arm, okay?
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.000]   This is after, yeah, right?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.360]   This is a Stevie Wonder song in a picture, okay?
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.340]   Like, it's incredible, okay?
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.480]   I just tan very, very easily,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.320]   and my wife is very white, okay?
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.100]   But that's just, you know, that's what happens to me
[00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.160]   when I spend some time in the sun, okay?
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.000]   I get dark, and people have a hard time
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.440]   placing where I am, right?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.280]   So in Texas, right, in Brittany's hometown, I am Mexican,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.640]   okay, look like Jorge, sound like George, okay?
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.360]   So it's like my accent throws people off completely.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.160]   They don't have a clue where I'm from.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.680]   But often here in Hong Kong, too,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.560]   I get mistaken for different ethnicities, nationalities,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.400]   right, people never think I'm Chinese,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.900]   and I know this because when they come and talk to me,
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.720]   they always start a conversation in English.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.480]   And so, you know, people think I'm Filipino,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.720]   they think I'm Nepalese or Thai,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.080]   Indonesian, Malaysian, anything else.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.680]   And so it's sort of like a superpower for me, I guess.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.320]   So I can be all things to all people, right?
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   Amen, yes, so.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.900]   Actually, this comes in super handy,
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.320]   especially when I'm on holiday in Southeast Asia.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.440]   So this one time I was in Thailand on holiday in Hua Hin,
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.840]   and I decided to go and check out
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.160]   some local kickboxing matches, you know,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.380]   UFC and kickboxing, wrestling,
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.300]   I love all that kind of stuff.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.200]   So I go downtown to Hua Hin, I'm dressed like a local,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.080]   so you know, flip flops, faded jeans, faded t-shirt,
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.840]   and everyone thinks I'm, I sit down,
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.480]   you know, people talk to me in Thai,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.220]   I try to order the food in Thai,
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.440]   you know, just very minimal conversation,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.580]   and I'm trying to get by as a local.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.500]   And so when I get down to the kickboxing stadium,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.540]   you notice this, I notice there's two lines,
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.380]   one for foreigners and one for locals, right?
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.940]   If you go through the foreigner line,
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.460]   first of all, it's more expensive,
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.340]   and the seats are like up in the bleachers,
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.240]   you know, you're away from all the action.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.500]   But if you go to the locals line, it's cheaper to get in,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.180]   and plus, like, you're like right there
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.380]   in the pit around the ring, like ringside seats.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.180]   And so I look, people up there seem very, you know,
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.380]   conservative and boring, just sitting there.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.900]   Down at the pit, you know, people were like shouting,
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.660]   and like, you know, the fighters were hanging out there,
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.860]   it just seemed like a more fun place to be.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.260]   So I thought, okay, I'm gonna try, okay,
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.220]   I'm gonna go into the local line and see what happens.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.380]   So, you know, I just stand back,
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.860]   observe what people are doing, and then that's what I do,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.500]   right, I get my money ready, you know,
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.860]   go, don't say much, just give them the exact money,
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.740]   and I let get into the local line.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.180]   Nobody questions me about who I am, right?
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.700]   And it was amazing, right?
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.140]   The atmosphere in there was so loud,
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.220]   people shouting, all sorts of things, you know,
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.940]   so every time someone would shout something,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.980]   I would just shout the same thing, right?
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.240]   Probably curse words or whatever it was I was shouting,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.180]   people taking bets, I was throwing money around,
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.820]   I had no idea what was going on,
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.500]   but I had the best time of my life, right?
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.300]   So exciting being there.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.040]   But then the fights were over.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.900]   And I left the stadium, and I was just back
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.020]   to being normal Ellison again, right?
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.260]   I was never a Thai local, I just looked the part
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.200]   for a moment.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.420]   And so this made me wonder, right,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.720]   does this happen with our relationship,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.600]   with our dedication and our faith in Jesus?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.920]   Most of us in this room today,
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.480]   most of us watching online would probably profess
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.120]   with our mouth that Jesus is our Lord and Savior.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.080]   Most of us would say we have a faith in Jesus.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.720]   If you remember what Philip talked about last week,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   he was talking about people asking him and his child
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.920]   what religion they are, right?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920]   If people ask you what religion are you,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.360]   you would probably say, well yes, I'm a Christian.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.720]   Right, and we gather together,
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.540]   and we all know how to look the part,
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.300]   especially in an environment like this, right,
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.640]   where we're singing and praising, we can lift our hands,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   we can kneel down on the floor, right?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.920]   If you've been in church for a while,
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.840]   you probably know how to speak Christianese, right?
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.300]   All these things on the outside we can present
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.800]   as a person who looks like they have
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.120]   a dedicated faith to Jesus.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.680]   But throughout the book of James,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.920]   one of the key things we're gonna try to be figuring out
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.920]   is how pure our religion is.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.700]   In other words, how do I know
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.820]   if we really have a faith in Jesus?
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.180]   How do you know your faith is genuine?
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.300]   And even if I was to ask this more directly,
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.460]   does the faith you profess match up
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.680]   with the way we live our life?
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.060]   Do we have the kind of faith that God is looking for?
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.560]   And if so, what are some of the hallmarks
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.040]   that genuine faith in Jesus looks like?
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.580]   As we walk through the book of James,
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.960]   you're gonna figure out this is the kind of faith
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.580]   that doesn't get tossed and turned around
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.740]   with the trials of life.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.620]   It's a faith that's completely counter-cultural
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.100]   to the ways of this world.
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.900]   It's a kind of faith that is accompanied with action.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.980]   So like I said, James chapter two,
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.620]   we're gonna open it up, this is what it says.
[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.940]   My brothers and sisters,
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.260]   believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ
[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.780]   must not show favoritism.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.480]   Suppose a man comes into your meeting
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.340]   wearing a gold ring and fine clothes,
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.040]   and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.700]   If you show special attention
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.100]   to the man you're wearing fine clothes,
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.180]   say, "Here's a good seat for you,"
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.420]   but say to the poor man, "You stand there
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.940]   "or sit on the floor by my feet."
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.260]   Have you not discriminated among yourselves
[00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.160]   and become judges with evil thoughts?
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.860]   So one of the first things James is trying to address
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.420]   in this part of his letter
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.620]   is something called favoritism.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.280]   Now, this isn't saying that as people of faith,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.980]   you can't have certain preferences at all.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.940]   Like for example, if you like strawberry ice cream
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.180]   instead of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.700]   I'd say you're a crazy person,
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.280]   but go ahead, right, get strawberry
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.300]   if you think that's better, right?
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.460]   This is not what it's talking about.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.860]   What James is talking about
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.320]   is a toxic, evil kind of favoritism.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.900]   Favoritism that is rooted in injustice and discrimination.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.700]   Favoritism that judges people
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.320]   by worldly standards and values.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.060]   And unfortunately, the scenario James is talking about
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.440]   happens all the time in this city in Hong Kong.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.180]   I'm talking about people being judged
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.140]   by their economic status.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.580]   There is a disparity in the city
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.160]   between the rich and the poor,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.880]   and it's very clearly seen as we go about everyday life.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.000]   We have in Hong Kong the largest wealth inequality
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.840]   in the world.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.360]   Consistently, this is something
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.500]   we shouldn't be proud about, right?
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.120]   This is one of the top three most expensive places to live.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.280]   Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney, places like that.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.640]   In Hong Kong, it's (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.280]   If you're rich, you can have it all.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.560]   It's often the rich that get the honor and the privileges.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.720]   It's often the rich get special treatment
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.360]   and recognition, and meanwhile, the poor are overlooked.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.320]   The poor have to eke out a living
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.520]   in the world's most expensive city,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.160]   cram their families into these tiny, subdivided flats,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.200]   not being able to afford the many things
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.760]   that we might take for granted.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.640]   But the truth is, and this is not a small part
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   of our population, 1.39, 1.4 million people
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.360]   in Hong Kong live below the poverty line.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.760]   How's this for a statistic?
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.800]   Oxfam in 2024 found that the median monthly income
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.760]   for the poorest 10% of households was only $1,600,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.480]   $1,600 per month, and this was a drop
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.520]   from before the pandemic, okay?
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.360]   In contrast, the wealthiest 10% of households
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.360]   have a median income of $131,000.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.960]   This is a rise in 10% from 2019.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.320]   The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer,
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.320]   a disparity of almost 90 times between these two groups.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.520]   Now, I felt the sting of this firsthand somewhat.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.240]   When I was a teenager, my mom would make me
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.920]   do all sorts of jobs, right?
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.840]   So I've worked at all kinds of, I've delivered food
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.160]   on the street in Central, I've worked at a carnival,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.600]   I've worked at a doctor's office,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.720]   there's a receptionist, all these kind of jobs.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.800]   Her idea was to expose me to the different ways
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.280]   that people live from my relatively sheltered
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.040]   and comfortable life that I had,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.520]   so all kinds of summer jobs.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.800]   And one of the summers, I found myself working
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.280]   at a warehouse in Kwun Tong.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.960]   Now, I got the job there because my uncle
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.280]   was the manager of the warehouse, my dad's older brother,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.040]   right, and so, and this is the kind of place
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   where all your sort of dry goods at the supermarket
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.000]   sort of sit there before they get shipped off
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.840]   to the park and shops and welcomes and all that stuff.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.880]   So I'm talking about like toothpaste, toilet paper,
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.360]   bleach, cleaning products, all that kind of stuff
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.440]   is put in these warehouses, and my job was to pull them off
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.800]   these shelves, put them into boxes ready for them
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.680]   to be shipped to the different locations, right?
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.460]   And it was dusty, it was dirty, it was hot.
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.480]   My salary was 25 Hong Kong dollars an hour, okay?
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.080]   $25 an hour, this is about the year 2000,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.520]   something like that.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.800]   Now, for me, I was just doing it
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.840]   as some sort of an experience.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.200]   But I worked with two lovely old ladies
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.800]   who would sit there with me, and I was climbing up,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.000]   then they were packing the stuff.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.320]   But they were doing this for a living, all right?
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.140]   25 Hong Kong dollars to survive in Hong Kong.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.080]   And yet, they were some of the most generous people
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.920]   I've ever met.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.160]   Every now and then, they would take me out for lunch, right?
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.880]   This meant going down to the canteen downstairs
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.080]   where a meal was like 25 to like $40.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.560]   So they were spending 40, as much as I insisted,
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.880]   I don't need this, 40% of their daily income
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.760]   to buy me lunch, living on $25 an hour.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.400]   They had no idea that my uncle was their boss, right?
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.360]   They were just doing it because they loved
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.160]   and they cared because that was their heart.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.000]   Now, in the same building, there were the corporate offices
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   on the upper floors, right?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.640]   This space was cool and air conditioned, right?
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.560]   People wore suits and leather shoes,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.440]   making much more than $25 an hour.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.920]   So I remember, true story, one time I needed to go up
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.040]   to the office floor to collect something, right?
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.720]   I was all dirty and stinky from working in the warehouse.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.200]   I needed a drink of water, so there's a water cooler
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.120]   right there, so I went to get a drink of water,
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.680]   only to be stopped by a member of staff there
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.000]   and said, "Hey, don't do that.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.860]   "Warehouse workers aren't allowed here.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.800]   "If you need a drink, you need to go back downstairs.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.560]   "You're getting everything all dirty up here.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.720]   "Don't stay up here."
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.680]   The way I wanted to say, "Do you know who my uncle is?"
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.080]   Okay, like I didn't, okay, so, right,
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.760]   don't do that either.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.240]   But stuff like that happens all the time in this city, right?
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.280]   I'm not sure, I'm sure I'm not the only one
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.840]   who has encountered this.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.000]   If there ever was a city where the poor and the rich
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.040]   live right next to each other,
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.220]   yet are treated very differently,
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.680]   it's right here in Hong Kong.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.380]   Being rich gets you preferential treatment,
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.120]   and it so happens that back then,
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.060]   in the time of James, it was the same thing.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.840]   2,000 years, not much has changed.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.500]   Now, the question for us is,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.260]   would we let this happen in our church?
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.620]   On a more personal level,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.380]   would you react this way yourself?
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.900]   And James tells us in this letter
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.280]   that if we find ourselves being inclined
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.700]   to treat the rich with special attention,
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.620]   but look down on the poor, this is discriminatory.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.020]   It's judgmental, and it's evil
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.880]   because it goes against the very heart of God.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.880]   Now, of course, it's tempting to act in this way.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.940]   We like to cozy up to the rich and the powerful
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.580]   because of the benefits that it might have upon us.
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.620]   We honor them in hopes that they will give us
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.140]   some of their money and their wealth.
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.340]   We do it out of the way for them
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.340]   because maybe one day, they're gonna help us back.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.460]   You scratch my back, I scratch yours,
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.260]   that sort of mentality.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.420]   But what can a poor person offer us?
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.540]   They're just gonna drain our resources,
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.080]   drain our time, there is no benefit
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.560]   when we pay special attention to them.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.820]   Now, listen, church, this might be the way the world works,
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.820]   but it is ungodly and incompatible with our faith
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.140]   as Christians for us to act this way.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:02.340]   It's evil because it goes against God's heart.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.500]   And as we look through scripture,
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.180]   God's heart has always been to side himself
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.580]   with the poor and the needy.
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.380]   Think about the way Jesus entered into this world.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.540]   He didn't come in might, in pomp, in splendor.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.500]   He could have, but instead he came humbly, meek,
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.900]   with nothing, nothing that we look upon
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.640]   that we could desire, physically speaking.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.500]   He chose to identify with the poor
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.200]   as he came into this world.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.060]   2 Corinthians 2:9 tells us that though Jesus was rich,
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.360]   yet for your sake, he became poor.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.180]   And so how God calls us as a people of faith
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.180]   to work as opposites of how the world works.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.300]   He tells us that it is the poor
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.660]   that we should pay attention to.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.680]   It is the poor that we should open our hands wide to,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.800]   Deuteronomy 15, 11.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.600]   It is the poor that we should be inviting
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.620]   to our dinners and our banquets.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.740]   That's in the book of Luke.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.680]   It is the poor that the weak,
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.340]   that we must work hard to help.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.900]   Or the poor and the weak that we must work hard to help,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.400]   Acts 20.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.260]   It is the poor that we are called to sell everything
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.300]   and give it to them, Matthew 19.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.100]   And this beautifully is summarized
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.300]   in what James calls in his letter, the royal law.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.980]   It is the royal law because he got this
[00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.240]   from his brother, Jesus himself, who is the king of kings.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.260]   It's what Jesus called as part of the greatest commandment.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.260]   You are to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.700]   And our neighbor's church are the needy,
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.300]   the widows, the orphans, the poor.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.420]   A genuine faith in Jesus will never show favoritism
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.180]   to the rich in expense of the poor.
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.300]   A genuine faith in Jesus will always take action
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.940]   and be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.260]   And by the way, favoritism and discrimination
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.220]   isn't just about rich and poor.
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.700]   Any form of discrimination and favoritism
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:10.540]   that dishonors people is a dishonor and an insult to God
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.520]   because we have been made in his image.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.100]   But James is using the rich and the poor here as an example.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.300]   And to really drive this point home,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.900]   he goes on to deliver one of the hardest hitting,
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.780]   maybe one of the most controversial and challenging passages
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.060]   in the whole of scripture.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.960]   He tells us this.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.540]   What good is it, my brothers and sisters,
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.740]   if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.480]   Can such faith save them?
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.140]   Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.200]   and daily food.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.540]   If one of you says to them,
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.900]   "Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,"
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.340]   but does nothing about their physical needs,
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.020]   what good is it?
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.080]   In the same way, faith by itself,
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.420]   if it's not accompanied by action, is dead.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.520]   Now I say this is controversial
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.180]   because it seems to contradict what we love about our faith.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.180]   Our faith tells us that Jesus loves us no matter what
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.420]   and that there's nothing more that we can do
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.860]   to make him love us.
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.500]   We say that salvation is a free gift, right?
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.620]   It's salvation, grace and forgiveness.
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:23.360]   It's a free gift of God.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.540]   There is nothing we can do to earn that kind of love
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.120]   that God has for us.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.500]   And I would say yes and amen to these statements.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.820]   But it seems as though right now,
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.440]   James is saying that there are certain things,
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.280]   actually, you do have to do for our faith.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.500]   That faith alone is not enough.
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.040]   And I would say the answer to that question is also yes.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.460]   Because remember the point we're trying to answer,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.240]   with the point we made at the beginning,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.860]   the point Philip pointed us towards last week.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.380]   We are trying to determine whether our faith is real.
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.160]   We are trying to figure out what this pure religion is.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.160]   And pure religion, real faith has to be backed up by action.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.420]   Now don't get me wrong, okay?
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.740]   I'm not saying that your actions are going to save you.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.300]   That's not the point, that's bad theology.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.580]   This isn't what James is trying to say either.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:18.060]   But what we're trying to say
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.660]   is that those who truly follow Jesus
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.140]   will always be able to show you in some way
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.980]   that the faith is real.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.720]   Genuine faith has real deeds behind it.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.740]   Right, this is how, when I was doing some research,
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.820]   this is how one of the commentaries put it.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.540]   James is not arguing that works must be added to faith.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.940]   His point, rather, is that genuine biblical faith
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.580]   will inevitably be characterized by works.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.220]   These are hard-hitting questions,
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.900]   but we need to get to the bottom of it
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.760]   because our entire relationship with Jesus is on the line.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.140]   James asks us, what good is it, my brothers,
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.940]   if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.460]   Can such faith save them?
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.040]   Let's answer these questions.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.760]   Notice first that James says claims.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.020]   Now look, just because we claim something,
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.140]   it doesn't always mean it's true.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.940]   People make all sorts of wild claims,
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.860]   but if we believed everything that everyone said,
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.320]   we would be fools.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.500]   I could tell you that LeBron James and I,
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.300]   we have the same basketball skills, okay?
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.660]   What he can do on the court, I can do too.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.260]   I can do a slam dunk and shoot threes.
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.780]   I can do all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.400]   You would rightly say, okay, prove it, right?
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.860]   There's a court right down there next to the MTR station.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.740]   Bring a basketball, show me your skills.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.340]   And it's the same thing when it comes to our faith.
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.020]   If someone claims to have a faith in Jesus,
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.720]   they should be able to show you evidence of their faith.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.980]   Otherwise, how will we know
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.140]   that what they're saying is true?
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.620]   We can't unless we see their faith in action.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.340]   And the second part of that question is even a bit scarier.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.140]   Like I said, these things have eternal consequences.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:08.060]   One of the main motivations that people have
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.100]   in the journey of faith and becoming a Christian
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.900]   is because they want some sort of assurance of salvation.
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.020]   They want to know that after they die,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.920]   they're not gonna end up in some horrible place called hell,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.500]   but rather live out all of eternity in heaven
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.000]   where there's joy and bliss
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.140]   and all the nice, wonderful things you can think of.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.780]   Now, going to heaven, being in the kingdom of God
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.860]   for all eternity after we die,
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.420]   salvation, eternal life is a promise
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.060]   and a reward from Jesus.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.860]   But only for those who have a real and genuine faith
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.660]   that demonstrates real acts of service and love
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.060]   to those around us.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.900]   So the answer to the question is no.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.680]   A faith that does not live itself out with deeds
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.020]   is not the kind of faith that leads to salvation.
[00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.360]   James makes it even clearer for us.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.200]   He gives another scenario for us to imagine.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.880]   He says, suppose a brother or sister
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.000]   is without clothes or daily food.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.800]   If one of you says to them, go in peace,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.320]   keep warm and well-fed,
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.140]   but does nothing about their physical needs,
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.120]   what good is it?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:30.060]   It's not a complicated question.
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.200]   The answer is simple.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.100]   The Cantonese translation for this type of situation
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.680]   is [speaks in foreign language]
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.140]   It's kind of like an insult we use in Cantonese.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.260]   If you see someone in need but you don't help them,
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.900]   it's like a pitiful, shameful thing to do.
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.400]   So what good is it, asks James.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.480]   The answer is it's no good.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.120]   Faith that is not accompanied by action
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.960]   is a dead kind of faith.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.360]   It's no good just to give people your words and well wishes
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.740]   when the needs that they have are right in front of you.
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.840]   It's interesting because this kind of behavior
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.840]   sort of makes sense.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.360]   If you follow on from what James was talking about before,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.800]   well, if we're only showing favoritism to the rich
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.320]   and the powerful and the wealthy,
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.120]   well, they don't really need anything,
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.940]   and so there's nothing really we can do for them,
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.660]   and so when the needs of the poor are presented to us,
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.700]   we too are inclined to do nothing
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.860]   'cause it doesn't benefit us.
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.860]   There's nothing in it for us.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.580]   But at the same time, of course, now, we're not monsters,
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.140]   and so let's give them a prayer.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.460]   We don't wanna totally ignore them.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.500]   Let's scratch that itch on our conscience
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.540]   and give them our well wishes and send them on their way.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.220]   At least we did something, right?
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.280]   I've been asking myself, and I ask you, church,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.340]   is that what Jesus would do?
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:53.560]   Does that reflect God's heart for his children?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.140]   And in preparing the message series in James
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.740]   and in working with our team,
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.540]   I went through and I'm currently going through
[00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.820]   a lot of wrestling when it comes to this message
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.060]   because if I'm honest, quite often,
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.820]   when it comes to a situation like this,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.500]   I feel like my reaction doesn't always reflect
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.740]   the faith that I claim.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.680]   When there's physical needs in front of me
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.600]   that are to be met, sometimes I panic, I shrink back,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.680]   I don't want to do anything about it.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.640]   And I make excuses.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.440]   Oh, well, you know, if I help them now,
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.180]   I'm gonna be stuck helping them forever.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.780]   I don't have the time and the resources for that.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.580]   Or you say, is it really gonna help that much
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.360]   if I just do this right now?
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.100]   It doesn't really help them in the long run,
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.660]   so maybe it's better for me not to get involved.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   Or maybe, you know, like you say,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.140]   I've already prayed for them, right?
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:48.800]   God can do immeasurably more than I can do,
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.500]   so I've already prayed for them.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.420]   I'll leave it in God's powerful hands
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.940]   and he'll take care of it.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.820]   And then I start to feel guilty and ashamed
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.820]   because I knew I was supposed to do
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.300]   and I didn't do anything about it
[00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.780]   and it all gets super overwhelming
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.440]   and anxiety starts to set in and all this kind of stuff.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.100]   Maybe you can relate to this too.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.980]   And I'm working on it, okay?
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.140]   And this is how I try to resolve it
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.340]   and figure it out.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.220]   And I'm just being honest and real with you here.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.540]   I don't have the answer to really,
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.940]   haven't got it all figured out yet,
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.500]   but this is what I feel like God is leading me to
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.060]   in situations like this.
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:30.420]   So like I said, as people who possess faith in Jesus,
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.260]   if we ever come across a situation
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.700]   where we can meet an obvious physical need,
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.720]   like if we're taking the words of James literally here,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.800]   something immediate that we, tangible that we can do,
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.720]   then we have to respond.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.980]   We must respond.
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:49.080]   So for example, one thing that I personally try to practice
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.060]   as much as possible, when I see someone on the street
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.940]   that's homeless or sleeping rough,
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.960]   someone asking for money, I will stop and ask,
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.880]   can I get you something to eat?
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.540]   Are you hungry?
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.200]   And if the answer is yes,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.900]   okay, then I go and get them something to eat, right?
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.620]   Go and get a fine hot from down the road,
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.660]   go to 7-Eleven, get some snacks, whatever, okay?
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.440]   If I see an elderly lady, often it is a lady, right,
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.880]   pushing those heavy carts down the street,
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.720]   I will stop her and say, hey, where are you going?
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.320]   Down to the collection point,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.240]   let me push it the rest of the way.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.920]   You take a rest and I'll push it for you, okay?
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.100]   Take a break, it's hot, it's sweaty,
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.360]   I can do this much easier, right?
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.920]   Now, 10, 15 minutes out of my day,
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.320]   but that should be okay, right?
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.080]   It's always the right time to do the right thing.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.280]   At the same time, I've also had to learn
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.520]   to let go of the idea that I have to solve
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.400]   all their problems.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.120]   I don't think that's the point either.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.840]   Also, that's impossible, right?
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.400]   I'm just a man, right?
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.280]   I'm nobody, I'm just a man, I'm not the savior.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.560]   Jesus is the savior and ultimately, of course,
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.280]   we want to point people towards them,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.080]   but I don't want to do nothing.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.240]   I'm not content with just to leave them
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.040]   with my thoughts and my prayers.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.760]   In that moment, in that space,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.760]   I've done as much as I could.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.400]   I've tried my best to show them Jesus' love,
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.720]   I've responded in obedience with some sort of action,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.120]   and I try to be at peace with that.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.400]   And I think this is what Jesus is expecting
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.040]   of his followers.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.180]   He knows we can't do everything.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.520]   He is the savior and his call ultimately
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.160]   is for us to bring people to him
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.520]   and he is indeed able to do all,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.860]   more than we ask or imagine.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.460]   But he's also looking for people
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.680]   who are willing to take action.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.400]   And if you want to be very clear about this,
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.600]   Matthew 25 lays it down so clearly.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.180]   He says this, "For when I was hungry,
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.040]   you gave me something to eat.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.440]   I was thirsty, you gave me something to drink.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.720]   I was a stranger and you invited me in.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.480]   I needed clothes and you clothed me.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.200]   I was sick and you looked after me.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.400]   I was in prison and you came to visit me."
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.360]   Jesus tells us that whenever we care
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.280]   for the least of our brothers and sisters
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.720]   in these sort of situations,
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.900]   we are doing it for him.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.920]   These are the people who get to enjoy
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.660]   the inheritance and the kingdom of eternal life.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.100]   But he also gives us a sobering warning
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.960]   for those who ignore these needs.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.260]   When he was hungry and we gave him nothing to eat,
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.720]   we were thirsty and we gave him nothing to drink,
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.820]   he was a stranger and we don't invite them in,
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.580]   they needed clothes and you did not clothe me.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.220]   I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.440]   Jesus tells us that those who fail to respond
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.900]   in love and compassion but yet claim to know him
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.900]   are not just ignoring people, they're ignoring him.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.580]   Whatever you did not do for one of the least of these,
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.800]   you did not do for me and the consequences
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.820]   are eternal fire and punishment.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.580]   Now, let's remember the main point
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.300]   of what Jesus is trying to say.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:08.580]   How do we know that our faith is genuine?
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.700]   A faith that leads to salvation,
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.100]   a faith that matches up with what we profess
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.580]   with our mouth.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.380]   But because both these groups of people
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.380]   claim to know Jesus but only one is accepted
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.220]   and welcomed into his kingdom.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:32.360]   It's not just believing in Jesus that counts as faith.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.960]   Right, James goes on to say, right,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.440]   you believe that there is one God, good.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.960]   Even the demons believe that and shudder.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.440]   Just let that sink in for a moment, church.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.760]   I mean, it is a brutally honest reflection
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.080]   that we're looking at today, I get it, okay?
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.200]   But if a faith is just words, James is telling us
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.560]   that your faith is no different from the faith
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.480]   that demons have.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.280]   And we see this all the time in scripture
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.160]   as Jesus is casting out demons, right,
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.760]   the demons are declaring, yes, this is the savior,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.600]   this is the Messiah.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.520]   Jesus has to actually say, don't tell anyone about this,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.280]   okay, because they even know who he is.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.360]   Now, wouldn't it be a shame if a group of Christians
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.360]   that profess faith in Jesus to have the same kind of faith
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.320]   that demons have?
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.880]   Demons that are actively trying to do everything they can
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.020]   to distract people from the Lord?
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:29.920]   Demons who are losers, who have already lost the battle?
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.040]   We don't wanna be on that side, right, church?
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   This is a call to embrace genuine faith,
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:44.500]   a faith of active, working obedience to Jesus.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.080]   And yes, part of this is our concern
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.340]   for the poor and the needy,
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:54.820]   but it applies to every single part
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.300]   of how we live our lives.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   It's a life that's gonna take action and risk and sacrifice.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.280]   And for example, James finishes
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:13.040]   with two contrasting characters, Abraham and Rahab,
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.960]   to let us know what God is expecting
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.760]   for those who follow him.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.960]   Let's look at Abraham first.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.880]   James writes, "Was not our father Abraham
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.040]   "considered righteous for what he did
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.000]   "when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.160]   "You see that his faith and his actions
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.740]   "were working together, and his faith was made complete
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.960]   "by what he did.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.460]   "And the scripture was fulfilled that says,
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.240]   "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.180]   "as righteousness, and he was called God's friend.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.680]   "You see that a person is considered righteous
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.440]   "by what they do and not by faith alone."
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.840]   If you recall the story of Abraham, right,
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.760]   what he called to do was absolutely wild.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.280]   It was insane, right?
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.520]   Imagine you having to wait till you're 100 years old,
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   right, before finally God gives you the thing
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.640]   that you've been hoping for,
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.120]   a son that's gonna finally, your true son,
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.760]   that finally is gonna pass down your bloodline,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.800]   that through this son you're gonna have generations
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.960]   and generations, as many as stars in the sky,
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.920]   only for then God to say, here he is, give him back to me.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.440]   Sacrifice him on the altar.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.840]   Now what would you do?
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.520]   Now honestly, for me, I don't know.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.600]   But Abraham had a faith that even if God asked him
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.880]   to do something that made no sense to him whatsoever,
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.980]   he would respond in obedience and do it anyway.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.940]   I was trying to put myself in Abraham's shoes
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.520]   as I was preparing this, right?
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.440]   I have sons, two boys, right,
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.840]   and as ungentle as my parenting is sometimes, okay,
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.960]   I can't imagine the fear, the guilt,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.080]   the gut-wrenching torture it must have been
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.760]   to take Isaac, bind him up, put him on the altar,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.360]   to raise the knife, it was only at the final second
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.760]   before he plunged that knife into his son's heart
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.380]   that God said, stop, do not harm the child.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:14.000]   Abraham put action behind his faith.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.260]   And Rahab is the same.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.760]   She translates her faith into action,
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.000]   even though it was super risky for her.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.080]   She had no idea, if you know the story,
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.960]   if the spies would honor their word.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.680]   But what she had heard about was this God
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.940]   that was able to part the Red Sea,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.200]   that people were able to walk across dry land
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.920]   to be saved from slavery,
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.720]   that these people had a God behind them
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.240]   that was destroying all their enemies.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.720]   She had only heard about these stories
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.040]   and she decided, I'm gonna put my faith in a God like that,
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:49.040]   not in these pagan gods that my family
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.560]   and my people have been worshiping,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.520]   I'm gonna put my faith in this most high,
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.120]   living, powerful God.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.800]   And she puts her faith in God and she hides the spies
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.400]   and she and her family are saved
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.820]   because she put her faith into action.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.440]   Now on the surface,
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.000]   these two people couldn't be more different.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.500]   We have a male and a female.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.960]   We have the founding father of the Judeo-Christian faith
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   and a Canaanite prostitute.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   And James does this on purpose.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.280]   He does this because he's saying,
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.960]   it doesn't matter who you are,
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.120]   but this are the people that God is looking for,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.400]   those who have an obedient, action-filled faith,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.880]   faith expressing itself through love of God.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.040]   So how about us?
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.880]   Are we willing to take risks for Jesus?
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.320]   Are we willing to put our faith into action?
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.800]   Are we willing to face danger
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.680]   to demonstrate our faith in Him?
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.880]   What has God been calling you to respond in obedience to?
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.980]   What has God been calling you into action?
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.120]   Translating belief into action,
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.560]   even when it seems impossible or downright dangerous,
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.060]   that is the faith that matters.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.040]   Faith without deeds is dead.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.320]   So having heard all of this,
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.880]   let me ask you one more time today.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.740]   Is your faith genuine?
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.440]   Because let me tell you,
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.480]   if you're banking on the fact
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.560]   that you went to a rally one time or at youth camp,
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.920]   you said a little prayer,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.680]   and maybe even you were baptized,
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.000]   and since then, your life hasn't changed,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.880]   you haven't done anything to put your faith in Jesus,
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.080]   your actions haven't shown that you live a life
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.640]   that is obedient to Christ,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.400]   your heart does not break for the things
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.360]   that break His heart,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.600]   you're not engaged in looking after the poor
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.000]   and the marginalized,
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.260]   I'm sorry to tell you that's a dead kind of faith, church.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:02.160]   But if we serve a risen and living God,
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.420]   a God that has come to give us life,
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.640]   Jesus loves you too much
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.000]   to let you keep going down that road.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.620]   He loves you so much that He gave His life for you.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.040]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.520]   How did Jesus show His love for us?
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.260]   Not just by telling us with His words,
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.700]   as comforting and as beautiful as they are,
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.360]   but they're only comforting and beautiful
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.800]   because He put action behind His words.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.040]   Right, Jesus stepped out of His throne in heaven,
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.960]   He lived among us, He healed us,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.280]   He fed us, He served us,
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.760]   He washed our feet, He embraced us,
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.680]   He invites us, He spoke up for us,
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.000]   and ultimately He went to the cross to die for you,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.320]   to show you His love.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.480]   He put His love into action.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.800]   And He loves you so much
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.680]   that He perfectly lived on this earth
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.660]   to tell us what an active faith looks like.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.260]   He knows you too well to be content
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.880]   just to watch you waste your life
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.580]   by not putting your faith into action.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.180]   And when Jesus comes back,
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.580]   He's looking for those who are truly faithful.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.460]   Is this what He's going to find
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.940]   when He comes back for this church?
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.900]   Is this what He's gonna find when He looks at your life?
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:30.820]   So I'm gonna ask you to close your eyes for a moment, church,
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.420]   and just think about those things for a minute.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.620]   I know it's been hard, and you know,
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:43.140]   we've been wrestling a lot with the book of James
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.840]   as we prepared this.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:53.500]   And in this beautiful gathering of God's children
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.000]   who make up this community,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.060]   and as God has called us into the uncharted,
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.000]   He's calling us into action.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.500]   [congregation murmuring]
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:13.440]   And like I said, all this is rooted.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.440]   This is not a guilt trip.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.200]   This is not a bashing over your head.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.260]   At least I hope not.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:28.420]   But this is a reminder of the love that God had for you.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.620]   This is a reminder of the potential that lives in you.
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:42.340]   That God, the plans that God in mind when He created you,
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.460]   when He knitted you together in your mother's womb,
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:50.880]   that He had a plan and a purpose for you to live out.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:58.020]   And for sure, that's one that includes obedience to Him,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.540]   of doing things in the sake of His name
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.240]   that you never thought you'd able to experience or see.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.220]   But because you allowed God's love
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.580]   and power to work through you,
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.600]   you bring honor and praise to Him,
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.660]   and life to others by doing that.
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:23.260]   And like I said just now, Jesus loves us too much
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.780]   to let us just be content with this comfy,
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.980]   cozy Christianity that is so easy to embrace.
[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.820]   (soft piano music)
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:38.700]   But rather, it's this life-changing,
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.620]   radical obedience to God
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:46.220]   that will bring salvation to you and those around us,
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.220]   that declares God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.980]   And so, Jesus, we pray.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.380]   If I could be so bold on praying
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.100]   on behalf of my brothers and sisters,
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.060]   that we would not be content just to have a faith
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.960]   that's based upon lip service,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.620]   that's based upon a few songs
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.520]   that we might sing every now and then,
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.580]   but it's a life of obedience.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:26.700]   It's a life that's constantly looking out for ways
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.580]   that we can show your love to others,
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.700]   no matter who they are,
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:34.100]   knowing as we saw in the video earlier,
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.140]   that your grace is sufficient for us,
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:41.300]   that even if it's the most challenging, mind-boggling,
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.080]   not-make-sense thing to this world
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.480]   that you've called us to do,
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.180]   that we will have the faith to put that into action
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.980]   and do it anyway, knowing you'll meet us where we are,
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.420]   that you'll never leave us abandoned,
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.540]   that you'll never leave us or forsake us,
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.620]   that we have a helper in the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.620]   (gentle music)
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.020]   And we have the most high God
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.380]   who fights every battle on our behalf.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:12.780]   So Jesus, make this our hearts, our lives.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:18.420]   May we be your good and faithful servants,
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.100]   sons and daughters, as we live out our life in this world,
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.380]   truly worshiping you with everything we have.
