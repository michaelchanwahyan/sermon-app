[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   All right, now I've got to preach about sex.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Oh, Lord Jesus!
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Give me a moment, give me a moment.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Oh, that was emotional.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   That wasn't supposed to be so emotional.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Oh, Lord Jesus.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   All right.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Well, welcome to the Vine.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   If you're new, we're emotional here.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Man, we're in this series of intimacy, aren't we?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Talking about intimacy this year.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And we're talking about how God is calling us in 2024 to be as intimate with Him as possible.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   To draw into deeper relationship and community with Him.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And we've been talking about how God has created us with an innate desire for intimacy.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   All of us, as humans, created in God's image,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   we have an innate desire for intimacy with God and with one another.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And we've been teaching in this series that when we fail to find the fullness of our satisfaction in intimacy with God, first and foremost,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   when we fail in that connection,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   then what will happen for all human beings is that we will naturally turn to other alternative forms of intimacy
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   to try to satisfy the hole that is there where we haven't been satisfied in that relationship with God.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   So when that one's not satisfied, we very naturally turn to other alternative forms of intimacy.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I would say the most seductive and the most destructive alternative form of intimacy that we turn to is sexual intimacy.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And so today I want to talk about sex.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I know that is a full-on topic.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Some of you have got salt and pepper in your head right now.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We're going to talk a little bit about this idea of sex.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Now, I want to say something that is a personal conviction for me right up front on this topic, and it is this.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I do not think that the global church is talking about sex enough.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   In fact, I would put it this way.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I would say the global church is actually in this time largely silent about sex.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And when the church is silent about a topic that is central to human flourishing and what it means to be made in the image of God,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   then basically what we're doing is we're allowing others to dictate to us in the church what we should believe about this topic.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Because you've got to understand that the world is talking about this topic.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   In fact, they're talking about it all the time.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   You just need to turn on your social media.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   You need to look at the newspapers.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   You need to watch films and TV shows.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You'll know that everybody is talking about sex.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   In fact, I did a poll on my Instagram this week, and of course that is the ultimate source of everything.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I did a poll on my Instagram this week, and I asked people how regularly are people talking about sex?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And over 65% of the people that responded said that they are in kind of friendship groups where people are regularly talking about sex.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So this is a conversation that's happening out there.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Here's the reality. When the church outsources its responsibility to talk about sex, two things happen.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   First of all, everybody else will define for us what sex is, and second of all, the church will be upset about that and will point fingers and judge.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Isn't that funny?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Like when we outsource our responsibility to talk about sex, the world then talks about it, and then we judge that and point fingers at it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You can't have your cake and eat it, church.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   We have to take up the responsibility to begin to speak about a glorious, biblical vision of sex and sexuality,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   bring that back into the heart of the church, because when we don't, we shouldn't therefore be surprised when we see a lot of sexual brokenness,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   both in the world but also within the church.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Hello, everybody.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   The problem is when we have talked about sex as the church, we've talked about it really badly.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   If you grew up here in church, no doubt you've probably heard some stuff be talked about sex over the years.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Normally, here is the rhetoric. Normally, here's what church will do.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Church will just say, "Look, sex is bad. Sex is to be avoided. Sex is something that you should not do.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Sex is something that's kind of mucky and disgusting and is a little bit messy, and sex is not right, okay?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And sex is just bad, so you should only reserve it for the one that you love."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Like, that's a good argument.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Like, sex is terrible, bad, wrong, never do it.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Oh, by the way, but when you get married, suddenly everything will be perfect, and you'll have this amazing sex life.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   This is how we as a church have often talked about it, and I have to say there is a brokenness within the purity culture.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Because if you have been fed a diet that sex is essentially bad and wrong,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   and when you get married, hey, presto, everything's going to be perfect, we end up actually letting a lot of people down in the church.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Because the reality is, what actually happens is, I can't tell you the number of times that I've pastorally sat with a young married couple
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   who are struggling with guilt and shame in the early years of their sex life in marriage,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   because they've been fed a constant rhetoric in the church about how bad sex is,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   and they brought that into their marriage, and it's a wonder that they're now struggling with trying to find enjoyment and pleasure
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   in something that God has created good.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Do you see that?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So I'm convinced that there has to be a better way for the church to be talking about sex. Amen?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And I want to do that a little bit today.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   That's my hope. That's my goal.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's to maybe paint a broader, bigger, and maybe a better way for the church to be talking about sex,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   and to understand the sex act, and also understand how that fits into a way that we've been created,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   and ultimately how that fits into marriage, and what all that is about.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And I want to say up front, I've only got about 40 minutes with you, I can't cover everything.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And I bet some of you have come in today and you're like, "Oh, I've got my question on sex.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Is Andrew going to talk about my topic of, you know, my question on sex?"
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   The reality is, I can't talk about everything today, but what I want to do is point a picture broad and glorious and beautiful,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   and invite you into it.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And I want to say a couple of things before I start. Here's the first thing.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   The first thing that I think we have to wrestle with is the reality that this topic is for all of us.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   No matter who you are in this room right now, this is an important topic for you.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   If you're here and you're single and you're happy and you're celibate, it's also for you.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   If you're here single and searching, if you're here single and dating,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   if you're engaged and preparing yourself for marriage, if you're married and you're flourishing,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   if you're married and you're struggling, if you're divorced, if you're a widow,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   no matter who it is, no matter where you're from, this topic is for you,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   because this topic sits at the very center of what it means to be created human.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And so this is a topic also for you.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Here's the second thing. I recognize that there is a lot of brokenness around this topic for all of us.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Every single one of us in this room, we bring a story into this topic,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   a journey that we've had perhaps in this area.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And there's hurt involved in that.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   There's brokenness and there's some pain and some suffering.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And the reality is we're all in a journey in this area,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and I just want to recognize and acknowledge that there are feelings about this topic, strong feelings.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Latest statistics would suggest that one in five people have been sexually abused or harassed at some point in their life.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   One in five.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And so there are many of us in this room where this is a personal and painful topic,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   and I want to just acknowledge that.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And I want to let you know that I'm not standing here as an expert on this topic,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   nor am I standing here as someone who has complete victory in this area of my life.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I'm here also as a fellow sojourner, if you will,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   in the challenges and the difficulties that this topic presents in our lives.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And so we're in this together.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And one of the problems is that when the church has tried to address this topic,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   they've so often done it from a name and shame perspective.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   And some of you in this room, I want to acknowledge this,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   some of you in this room have only ever been felt shame from the church
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   because of your sexual history or your sexual background or your sexuality,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   and you've only ever felt hurt or pain from the church.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Perhaps even, if I can be honest, this church.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And I'm convinced of a couple of things.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   One is that the church has done a lot of damage in this area over the years,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   perhaps even so the Vine.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I'm also convinced of this, that shame is never the way to help people walk through this topic.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   And there have been way too many sermons that are based on trying to shame people into sexual purity.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I hope today is not one of those.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   In fact, I'm convinced of this, that I think shame is one of the main reasons
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   why there is so much brokenness, and if that's the case,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   then shame surely cannot be the solution to it.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Are you with me, church?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Here's the third and final thing.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm not here today, my assignment here today is not to give you my opinions about sex or relationships.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   If you want opinions, you can go to Instagram and hear lots of people give you their opinions about it.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Today is about hearing what Scripture has to say about it,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   what God's glorious vision is for this,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   and for us to sit within that glorious vision in our hearts and our lives.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Is that okay?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So I hope that my opinion is limited,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   and I hope that the Scriptures are the things that you hear and take away with you today.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so to do that, we have to start in Scripture.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And I want to start right at the very beginning,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   because the very first thing you need to understand about sex in God's perspective
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   is that it is interwoven into the creation story itself.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   In fact, sex takes one of the prominent positions in the opening pages of the Bible.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I want to take you to Genesis 1, verse 27 and 28.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Is this okay still so far?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   All right.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   It says this, "So God created humanity or man in His own image.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   In the image of God, He created him. Male and female, He created them.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase in number.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Fill the earth and subdue it.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   over every living creature that moves on the ground.'"
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   These are the fundamental things that God says to His created beings, humanity,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   His gendered beings, He speaks over them, these very critical things.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And what God is doing in these passages, these are famous words for you,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   but I want to break this down in a way that perhaps you've not seen before or understood before.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   I want you to really get a grasp of what God is trying to create
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   when He's created you and me and humanity.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And I want to do that by showing you the four specific things that God creates
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   right at the start that have something to say about who you are.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   The first thing He says is that He blessed them.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Very simple words, He blessed them.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Before there was original sin, that happens in Genesis 3,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   there's an original blessing that happens here in Genesis 1.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   The very first thing He does after creating humanity is that He blesses humanity.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   He pours out His heart towards humanity.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   He creates pretty, this is the way of thinking about it,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   He brings Himself into relationship with humanity
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and invites humanity to be in relationship with Him.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   That's the first primary thing that happens.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Before He says anything, before He does anything, before anything else happens,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   He actually says, "I bless these people and they are to be in relationship with Me."
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So what basically God does right at the start is He creates this worship element
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   of Him with humanity and humanity with Him.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   We are created fundamentally to worship,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   to be in relationship with God and in community with Him.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And we receive blessing in that and we give blessing to that as well.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   You follow that?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Then He says, "I have made them in the image of Me, in God."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   God makes us in His image.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   This speaks primarily about the idea of identity.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Not only identity, okay?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Not only are we created to be worshipers, first and foremost,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   in our blessed relationship with God,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   but out of that He says, "You are made in My image."
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He gives us an identity right at the start.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And here's what you have to hear.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   That identity is central to who you are before you've done anything.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   As soon as you are conceived in your mother's womb,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   you are given identity as one who is created in the image of God.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   That means that you have, listen, you have inherent value, worth, love, and goodness.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It's inherent in you.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That's what it means to be made in God's image.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   No one is born into this world without any worth, any dignity, any value.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   No matter who they are, no matter what they go on to do,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   no matter whatever actions they might have,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   no matter what sexual history they have,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   in the beginning point, you are created with inherent value.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   That's the gift of being made human in the image of God.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Are you with me?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   That identity is really important that you understand,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   and that you understand that that identity flows from your relationship with God.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And I'll come back to that in a bit more.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Then He says these words.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   He says, "Be fruitful and multiply," or in other translations,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   "Be fruitful and increase in number."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Here's the thing you've never seen before. I love this.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   The first words of God over humanity are not, "Go and pray."
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Come on, church.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   The first words that God speaks over humanity are not, "Go and do a Bible study."
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's, "Go and have sex."
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Somebody's going to edit this, and it's going to be really bad.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   "Go and have sex."
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   That's what He says right up front.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   He says, "Go and have sex together,"
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   because this is the way that you're going to express what it is to be in this relationship with me,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   made in the image of God.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And so there is this sexuality that is right there at the beginning of all things.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Now, I want you to hear this.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   If you've never had sex in this room, if you're a virgin,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   or if you've made a decision to be celibate in your life for the rest of your life,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   you are still a sexual being who has sexuality.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   So this is not talking specifically only about the sex act.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   So I want to make sure that those in this room who have never had sex feel included in God's picture.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Sometimes we think if we haven't had sex, we're not fully who we are created to be.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I don't want you to hear that.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   You, whether you've had the physical act of sex or not, you are a sexual being with sexuality.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   You hold a sexualness to you, because that is what is being created in you in the image of God.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Are you following this?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Okay, that's really important that you understand that there is sexuality that is created in us as human beings.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   He then says, "Fill the earth and subdue it."
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   This is God basically saying, "Not only are you created to be in a relationship with me,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   to know that you have inherent worth, value, and dignity, to be a sexual being,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   but you are also created with purpose.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Go and fill the earth, subdue it, bring it under flourishing."
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I don't have time to unpack this theologically, but essentially what God is saying is,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   "Go into the world and co-partner with me in its shalom building, its shalom making.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Go and flourish this creation that I have created.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   You humans are to partner with me in the flourishing of creation."
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Now, I want you to see something really important here.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Not only do we have inherent self-worth, we also have active worth.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Come on, church.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   We have inherent worth.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   So, in other words, if you never picked up any piece of work, if you never bothered to do anything in life,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   you still have inherent worth, love, and dignity from God. Amen?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   But he's also invited you to active worth, active dignity, active love in how we relate with one another,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   how we do our work in the world, how we go and bring the purpose of the gospel into the world.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   All of these things are relational things that we get to do and are invited into.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Are you still tracking with this?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Okay, so this is what it means to be human.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   You are somebody who's created to worship.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   You have an inherent dignity and worth.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You are a sexual being, and you have purpose, active worth, in what you are doing in this world.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   This is all of us, and when you stand back from this, you begin to see a picture of what intimacy is.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Because intimacy flows from all four of these central things about who you are.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   So, there is a spiritual intimacy, which connects to the worship of who you are.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   There is spiritual intimacy.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   There is also here emotional intimacy, because you have this inherent self-worth and dignity,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   which gives you an emotional connection to who you are, to who God is, and to who creation is, and everybody around.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   You also have a sexual intimacy, which again, as I said earlier, is not just about the idea of sex,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   the physical act of sex itself, but you are given a sexual intimacy in terms of who you are made in the image of God.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   And that actually is really important, because what it says is that our immeasurable worth in who we are,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   created in God's image, and our sexual identity have always been linked from the very beginning.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It's really important you see this, because this actually has a lot to say later when we get into other areas.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Our identity, who we are in the image of God, and our sexuality, those two things are inherently linked from the very beginning.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And then purpose is the idea of relational intimacy.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   How we relate to one another, how we relate to the world around us, how we relate to creation.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   These four areas are the areas of our intimacy, and what you need to see is that all four of these are interlinked together,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   and none of them can exist alone, separate from the other.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   We are created to be unified in these things.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   So we have a spiritual intimacy, which impacts our emotional, sexual, and our relational intimacy.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   But you also have a relational intimacy that also impacts your emotional, spiritual, and sexual intimacy as well.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   You can't separate any of these together.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   They're all together, all interlinked, and this is the way that it was created.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   And God stands back from that and says, "That's very good. That's really good.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   That's the way the things ought to be."
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And then, before anything else happens in Genesis 3, something else significant happens in Genesis 2.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   God says, "Here's how I've created every human being to be."
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And when this gets expressed in the idea of family, in the way that God sees this being expressed in the idea of marriage and family,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   this is where this takes on a fullness of itself.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   So if I take you to the end of Genesis 2, it says, "For this reason, a man will leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   and they will become one flesh."
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   There it is, no shame.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   So this is what happens, and this is why the Bible focuses in on the idea of marriage.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   That a couple can come together and be what's called here, "one flesh."
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Let me unpack for you what this idea of one flesh is, because it has everything to link into what these four areas are.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   The word that the writer here of Genesis, for oneness, the word he's using is the Hebrew word, "echad," E-C-H-A-D.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And "echad" means oneness formed out of many parts.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Now, here's the important thing for you to know.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   The word "echad" is primarily used in the Old Testament to speak about God.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's the primary word that's used in relation to who God is.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   In fact, the central scripture of the Old Testament to speak about God's heart is the Shema.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   "Love the Lord your God with all your mind, heart, soul, and strength. Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   That, the Shema, it begins with this.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   It begins with, "You, O Lord, O God, are one."
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   It's the primary statement of the Old Testament position of who God is.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   "You, Lord, are one." That's the word "echad."
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   What it's saying is the Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   three somewhat different kind of elements, if you will,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   come together to form a oneness in God that no one can break.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Do you see this?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And this is the important thing.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   "Echad" is used in this relationship with God as the primary picture of who God is.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   He is the Lord our God is one.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Three in one.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And there is a bond in that that cannot be shaken.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   It cannot be broken.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   They're in an intimacy and a relationship together that is the ultimate picture of oneness.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So when the writer of Genesis begins to think about,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   "How do I describe the coming together of a couple in marriage?"
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   He goes, "I'm going to link it to who God is."
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   So what you've got to understand is that this is not just speaking about marriage.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   What actually is happening here in Genesis 2 is speaking about God as well.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   It's trying to bring marriage and God and the two of those things together as this one kind of idea.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   When a couple comes together in marriage,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   they become "echad" in the same kind of way that God is "echad."
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And when God comes together in a oneness that no one can separate,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   so these two can come together into a oneness that no one should separate.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   So marriage becomes the primary picture in the world of the "echad" of God.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   You still following this?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And this is a beautiful thing.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Because what it means to the couple getting married is that their relationship together
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   is lots of separate parts coming together to form one whole
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   that is a picture to the world of who God is.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   So marriage is not just about the sex act.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   But the sex act is included in this idea of coming together of the spirit, of the body,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   of the emotions, of our relationship, of everything that we are comes together with the other person
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   that we're married to and in the sexual union, in the act of sex,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   it is the ultimate outcome of the "echad" that is seen in God.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   This is why the Bible makes a really strong point that sex is reserved for marriage.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Because if sex is the coming together, remember for the Bible, sex is never just a physical act.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   That's one of the greatest lies of the world, that sex can just be physical.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   The Bible stands against that picture.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Because the Bible says sex is part of this one flesh, "echad."
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   So it is mind and spirit and emotions and body and everything else all coming together in one.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And if that's the way it is, no one should be able to break that because that's never broken in God.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And if no one should break that, then you should not go do that with lots and lots and lots and lots of people.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Because if you do that, what you're actually showing the world is a separateness, not a oneness.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   This is why sex is reserved for marriage in the Christian tradition and faith.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Because we get this beautiful gift to show the world oneness.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   When done in the right way, sex and marriage stands boldly against the tendency in this world to see more separateness take place.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Now does that mean that Christian marriages are perfect?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   No.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Does that mean that we don't still struggle with brokenness in marriage?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Of course it means all those things.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   But that doesn't negate the reality that God has created this institution as the only place for sex to take place.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Because our physical act of sex is a part of our echadding in the world,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   showing the world what the oneness of God is like.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   So when this all comes together, I want you to see how this then all flows together.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Because here's the thing, sexual brokenness is essentially the breakdown of the oneness, the echad that God has created for it.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   You need to understand if this thing here gets broken first,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   when our relationship with God and our intimacy with Him, when that breaks, that always impacts this.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I need you to see the flow.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   When this breaks, that impacts this.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Suddenly we don't feel loved anymore.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Suddenly we don't have the solid sense of inherent worth and value.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Because that solid sense of inherent worth and value only ever flows from intimacy and relationship with God.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   God has imputed that to us, made in creation with Him, image of Him.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   But when we break our relationship with Him, the first thing that takes place is us going, "I don't feel loved anymore.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I don't feel like I've got a value anymore."
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And not only that, but I don't think others have the same value I thought they had before.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And here's the inevitability, when this breaks, this breaks, and then that will always break.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   One of the reasons why we have such great sexual brokenness in the church,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   there is so much sexual brokenness, I would say, in the church.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Primarily because there has been a breakdown in the fundamental relationship with God here,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   which then has changed our belief and our acceptance of who we are and who others are.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   When that happens, we will find ourselves pursuing and seeking sex as a way to get back how we feel about ourselves.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   We will then use sex as a tool to try to feel more love, try to feel more acceptance,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   try to feel more value in the world around us,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   which inevitably is going to break our relationships more with the people around us.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Because when you have a selfish desire to use this to get that back, you're going to break this as well.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Following?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And so the way that God has created this is He's saying, "Can you just see the vision that I've created?"
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   When this is strong, you will have a strong sense of who you are.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And when you know that you're loved and you have a strong sense of who you are,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   then you can reserve the sexual act for marriage,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   believing that you want to show the world the oneness that there can be,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   that two have been brought together.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Let no one break that apart.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And in that, in the security of that, you can raise children, have children,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   flourish children, and have relational connections with those around us.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   And you're not using relationships or identity and emotional brokenness and manipulation
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   to try to satisfy something here that can only truly be satisfied from here to there to there.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   That's the beautiful invitational vision.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   And here's the brokenness.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   We so often turn people into objects.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   The majority of sexual brokenness that happens in the world happens because we objectify people.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   This is really powerful.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   I want you to track this with all the theology I've been giving you this morning.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   If Echad is about oneness, about separate parts coming together,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and if that oneness is best seen in marriage and in the way that that happens within marriage,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   then here's what objectifying other people is all about.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   It's about separating the parts again.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   It's the opposite of Echad.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   It is basically saying, "I'm not interested in you for your emotions, for your relationship, for who you are.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I'm only interested in your body.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   I'm going to separate all the other elements of who you are,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   and I'm just going to focus on your body for my own sexual gratification.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I think your body is attractive, and because I'm attracted to your body,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   I'm going to now use that to gain pleasure and satisfaction for myself
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   because ultimately I'm broken here, and when I'm broken here, I think everybody else is broken,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   and I will start doing the opposite of Echad.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   I will separate people down to just their physicality,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   and I will use that and abuse that to try to make myself feel better
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   when this is the thing that's truly broken."
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Is this helping anyone?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   That's the glorious vision, and that's why there is so much brokenness.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   We've gotten our intimacy in the wrong way and in the wrong order.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Let me finish just by showing you a little demonstration of this.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I got this demonstration from another pastor.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Pastor is Robert Madu. He's based in the U.S., although lots of other pastors have done it since,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   so I just wanted to tell you up front I'm gleaning something today.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Remember a few weeks ago? This is a glean, but I've changed it a little bit
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   to make it more applicable to what we're talking about today.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I want you to see these boxes of intimacy.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   The largest box is always the spiritual one because that is the primary one
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   that has been created for us.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   That is the top left-hand corner here.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   That is the thing that is always for us.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Now, there are other intimacies that we have.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   We have, for example, the emotional intimacy.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Emotional intimacy is a big one because there is also so much for us to say and do
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and understand about ourselves.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   As I've talked about earlier, we have this idea of relational intimacy.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   That's a little bit smaller box because our relational intimacy is not just dependent on us.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   It's dependent on other people.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   There are boundaries sometimes to that.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   We're not able to always be in relationship with the people we want to be in relationship with.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   That one's a little bit smaller.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Then over here, we have the sexual intimacy box, which is the smallest of all
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   because this is the one that has the greatest boundaries around it in Scripture,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   the one that has the context around it, and also it's the one that--yeah,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   just is small because--yeah.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Anyway, it doesn't always last very long.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   That's probably another way of saying it.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Okay, so--now, let me explain to you--sorry, sorry.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I should have said that.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   There was bound to be something I was going to say that would come out wrong.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Okay, so I want you to see this.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Here's how I think we often approach relationships.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   I would say in the world particularly but also, unfortunately, in the church,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   we start with a sexual premise to begin with.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   That person's hot.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   I'm attracted to that person.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   There's a desire for that body or there's a desire for that satisfaction.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Right off the back of that, we throw on some emotional intimacy
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   because what happens when you have physical sex with someone
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   is there's an incredible, powerful link of emotional insecurity.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   But what you do is you connect your sex to the emotion,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   and then that way, those things become unhealthily connected now
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   so that if you're having sex, you feel emotionally connected to that person.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   When you're not or that's broken, then you struggle with your emotions
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   about that relationship.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   In the world, often, we then try and throw relational intimacy on top of that
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   because it's like we try to buy first.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   We get emotionally connected.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   We then go, "Well, I guess maybe we should start dating or hanging out more
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   or maybe we should try and be a little bit more committed."
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I think in the church, sometimes this is the driving factor.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   We then find this, and then we decide that we need to get engaged
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   or something like that.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Then ultimately, if you're not a Christian, then that's where you'd stop.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   But us Christians, we then want to slap some spiritual intimacy on top,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   and that's what happens.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Are you with me?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Now, here's the biblical vision that God gives,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   which is the one we need to understand.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   It starts with the worship.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It's got to start with the spiritual intimacy first and foremost,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   which then tells us who we are and who others are.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   That's the identity piece that's there, which then, of course,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   enables us to be in healthy relationship with those around us
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   as well as potentially a life partner.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   If marriage does eventually come, then we can enjoy
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   the incredible sexual intimacy that has been provided out of it.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   That's the biblical picture.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   That's what I want to inspire you with today.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   For those that are single here and perhaps never going to get married
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   or maybe have decided in celibacy,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   it doesn't mean you're one-third or three-fourths a human being, remember?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Because you are a sexual person,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   whether you're actually engaged in that activity or not,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   you're a whole person, and you can still have healthy sexuality
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   even if you're celibate or not ever married
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   or if you're a virgin for life.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Does that make sense to you still?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   But for those that do get married and can engage in that,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   you then put that on top as a way of expressing this oneness,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   the echad of who God is in marriage.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   That, my friends, is the biblical vision.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I think as we lean into this and get inspired by this,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   again, it doesn't mean that every Christian marriage is perfect,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   but it does mean that we submit ourselves under the grace of God
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   and invite Him to help us.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Christianity is not behavior modification.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Christianity is inviting the vision of Christ and the gospel
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   into our hearts and our lives and saying,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   "I want to live like that. God, give me the grace to do so.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And forgive me where I so know that I so often fall short,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   but that does not negate the beautiful picture you've given me.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Help me. Help me to be one who can honor the echad
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   of who you are in this world."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   So my encouragement to you today is not to feel bad.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Hopefully, you haven't felt shamed.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Instead, I hope you felt inspired.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I hope you've been welcomed into a beautiful, bigger vision
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   of who you are yourself.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And regardless of what state you are in life right now,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   what status you might have in relationships,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   that you would say, "This is what I want for me and my family."
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   And as we come together in that, we pray for each other
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and we ask God to heal us of all the brokenness that is there.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Because if you're anything like me, there's brokenness there.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And we come around each other and encourage each other
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   and love on each other and pray for each other.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And we live because the world needs this narrative.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   This is hope. This is how families are created.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   This is how children are to be nurtured and brought into the world.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   This is the way it should be.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And God stands back from that and says, "It is very good."
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Can I pray for you? Let's pray.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Father, I thank you so much for every person here.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And Father, I thank you for the fact that you've made them human.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And as we've seen this morning, that's such a glorious picture.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And you've created us sexual beings.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   And you've given us this gift of sex and all of its beauty and wonder and mystery.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And Father, we pray that you would help us to be good stewards
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   of the intimacy you have blessed us with.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Spiritual, emotional, relational, and sexual.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And that in our stewardship of that intimacy, we would remind ourselves
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   that it is our relationship with you, out of which flows everything else.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And when that relationship breaks, other things also begin to fall.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And I wonder whether you would just take a moment here this morning,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   just to allow God to speak to you about you and Him.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   That spiritual intimacy with Him.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Because how you think about yourself and how you think about others,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   and therefore your sexuality, and therefore your relationships,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   all flow from that point.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   You're blessed. You have inherent worth and dignity and value.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   He loves you.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   But when that breaks down, everything else breaks down behind it.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   So maybe today's response is just for you and Him.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Just to take a moment now.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Maybe for some of you, you want to worship Him.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   You want to just offer your life and heart to Him again.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   For some, it might be you want to listen to what He has to say to you today
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   about this area of sexual identity and sexuality and sex itself.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Perhaps for some of you, it's opening your heart
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   to what the Holy Spirit might want to challenge you about.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   But it's you and God always, first and foremost.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   And out of that might come the need for other things.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   But right now, I want to encourage you to connect with Him.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   And in that intimacy, you would hear His voice.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
