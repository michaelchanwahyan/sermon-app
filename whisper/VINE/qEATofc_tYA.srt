1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Well, when I was in university, I was very proud

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,080
 because I made the men's basketball team.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,920
 I know.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,520
 And on my team, there was actually incredible players.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,880
 They were really good.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,240
 One of them, so much so that every summer,

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,240
 he practiced with NBA players.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,120
 So it was like he, I was living in Northwest.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,360
 At that time, there was the Seattle Supersonics.

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,280
 They now moved to, I think, Oklahoma City or something.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,000
 And so he was playing with some of those players.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Now, on the men's team, there usually was seven

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
 or eight players that got to play most of the time.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,040
 I was not one of them.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,000
 So we'll see the other ones play.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,560
 Now, the first year, I was okay with that.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,040
 You know, the other players are better.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,800
 That's fine, fantastic, you know, go ahead.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,800
 Second year, there was one guy that was playing my position

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,920
 who was in that eight-person rotation.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,880
 And I felt like that I had the similar skill set as he did.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,800
 And I started comparing myself to him.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,640
 And as I was doing that, I was like, you know,

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,120
 I really would deserve to have a spot

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,320
 and be able to play and be in that rotation.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,760
 At the very least, I should get the opportunity

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,840
 to prove myself a few times.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,160
 Why does he get to play?

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,320
 Why don't I get to play?

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 And so I started to complain and grumble inside my heart

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,920
 as I compared myself.

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,520
 Now, before that, I was actually feeling great.

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,680
 I was so proud to be on the team.

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,720
 But when I started comparing, all that went out the window.

35
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,040
 Isn't that interesting how that goes, right?

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,280
 Like when you start complaining,

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,360
 like maybe something that we enjoyed before

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,280
 or something else good suddenly doesn't seem

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
 that good anymore.

40
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
 Now, we all experience that.

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
 You know, whether that's in your workplace,

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,680
 in a relationship, in church,

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,000
 in all these different places, we experience that.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,600
 That's when we start comparing ourselves,

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,680
 we get tunnel vision.

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,480
 We start focusing in on what the other person has

47
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
 that we don't have, that we should have.

48
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,240
 And we kind of lose joy along the way.

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,560
 Like we stop seeing the good things

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,800
 that God is doing in our lives.

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 And a lot of times, there's a lot of negative emotions

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,040
 with that as well, right?

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,960
 And so what I wanna do with you today,

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,240
 I wanna explore with you a question is,

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,240
 how can we break out of or escape from this pattern

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,480
 of comparing ourselves with others that brings us down?

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,440
 You know, how do we get out of that?

58
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,400
 'Cause it's so destructive and it's like kills our joy.

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,880
 You know, what do we do?

60
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,600
 And what does God's word have to say to us about that?

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,960
 So we are in a new sermon series

62
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,480
 that we have entitled "Living the Kingdom Parables."

63
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,280
 And Jesus, if you're familiar with him,

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,400
 I think like 30 or 40% of the words in the Bible from him

65
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,240
 are actually parables.

66
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,280
 So it was one of the major ways that he taught.

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,240
 And for those of you who are not so 100% sure

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,440
 about what is a parable, that sounds interesting,

69
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,280
 but what is this?

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,880
 Here's a little definition.

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,120
 A parable is a comparison that employs

72
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,520
 an ordinary circumstance in everyday life

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,240
 to illustrate a spiritual truth.

74
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,640
 So Jesus uses everyday examples,

75
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,520
 but with that he's actually illustrating,

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,120
 you know, a truth about something else.

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,880
 And in this series,

78
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,640
 we're gonna look at five different parables.

79
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,760
 Parables also, they tend to provoke us.

80
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,600
 They tend to stir some emotions in us

81
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,760
 'cause there's something in them

82
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,560
 that rubs us the wrong way.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,880
 And it's usually right at that point

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,480
 where we are rubbed the wrong way

85
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,360
 that God wants to say something to us,

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,240
 that that's why Jesus uses them,

87
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,400
 because they're so powerful.

88
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
 And so I'm really excited about this series.

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,200
 And the heart behind it is that we can align ourselves

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,400
 with a kingdom mindset, with kingdom living,

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,840
 with the things where we are not aligned

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,800
 with God's will, Jesus' desire for us,

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 his followers, his disciples.

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,640
 Now in just a moment,

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,120
 we're gonna look at the parable of the laborers

96
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
 in the vineyard.

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,200
 But before we get there,

98
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,640
 I wanna settle it with the context.

99
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,600
 And actually, there's a lot of things

100
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,080
 that could be said about the context.

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,280
 It's a lot more than I usually would do,

102
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,520
 but I'm gonna try to keep it very short.

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,000
 So basically, there's a story where a rich young man,

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,680
 he comes to Jesus and he wants to understand,

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,400
 how can I have eternal life?

106
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,880
 But in the process of talking with Jesus,

107
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,680
 he chooses his wealth over following Jesus.

108
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
 And he walks away sad, but he's just not able to let go

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,960
 of what Jesus asked him to do.

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,080
 Now in response to this, Peter, who was listening,

111
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,400
 who has left things behind, he's like, "Hey, Jesus,

112
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,240
 "what about us?

113
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,280
 "I wanna read with you actually something that he says."

114
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,240
 So it's Matthew 19, verse 27.

115
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
 He says, "We have left everything to follow you.

116
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,360
 "What then will be there for us?"

117
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,760
 And it's interesting because Jesus,

118
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,840
 he does tell Peter that there will be rewards

119
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,320
 for him leaving everything,

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,000
 that he actually will bless them in incredible ways.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,080
 But he also tells this parable

122
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,000
 in response to Peter's question.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
 'Cause there's something about the question,

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,840
 there's something about the comparison that Peter did

125
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,200
 to the rich young ruler,

126
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,400
 where Jesus wants to say a little bit more.

127
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,120
 Where there's something else that needs to be said.

128
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,680
 And this is where we're gonna pick up.

129
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,120
 So we're in Matthew chapter 20,

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,160
 we're starting in response, it says this.

131
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,080
 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner

132
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,580
 "who went out early in the morning

133
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,920
 "to hire workers for his vineyard.

134
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,240
 "He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day

135
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,600
 "and sent them into his vineyard.

136
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
 "About nine in the morning, he went out

137
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,160
 "and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.

138
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,140
 "He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard

139
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,480
 "'and I will pay you whatever's right.'

140
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
 "So they went.

141
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,380
 "He went out again about noon

142
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,900
 "and about three in the afternoon, did the same thing.

143
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,260
 "About five in the afternoon,

144
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,660
 "he went out and found still others standing around.

145
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,220
 "He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here

146
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,560
 "'all day long doing nothing?'

147
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,700
 "Because no one has hired us, they answered.

148
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,880
 "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'

149
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,300
 "And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard

150
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,500
 "said to his foreman, 'Call the workers

151
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,460
 "'and pay them their wages,

152
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,640
 "'beginning with the last ones hired and going to the first.'

153
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,720
 "So the workers who were hired about five in the afternoon

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,520
 "came and each received a denarius.

155
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,940
 "So when those came who were hired first,

156
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,560
 "they expected to receive more.

157
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,220
 "But each one of them also received a denarius.

158
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,400
 "When they received it,

159
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,840
 "they began to grumble against the landowner.

160
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,200
 "'These who were hired last worked only one hour,'

161
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,640
 "they said, 'and you have made them equal to us

162
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,560
 "'who have borne the burden of the work

163
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,040
 "'and the heat of the day.'

164
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,960
 "But he answered one of them,

165
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,580
 "'I'm not being unfair to you, friend.

166
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,540
 "'Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?

167
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,580
 "'Take your pay and go.

168
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,620
 "'I want to give the one who was hired

169
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,320
 "'last the same as I gave to you.

170
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,060
 "'Don't I have the right to do what I want

171
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,800
 "'with my own money?

172
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,040
 "'Or are you envious because I am generous?

173
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,900
 "'So the last will be first and the first will be last.'"

174
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,740
 Wow, that's a lot, isn't it?

175
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,900
 So let's unpack that, let's walk through this parable,

176
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,260
 and let me highlight some things along the way.

177
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,880
 So the first thing is, in this parable,

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,720
 it's, again, it's an everyday scene.

179
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,140
 It's a laborer looking for workers, the workman's vineyard.

180
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,540
 So people, he finds people in the marketplace,

181
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,120
 he tells them, "You want to come work in my vineyard?

182
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,260
 "There's probably the harvest.

183
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,480
 "These workers will bring in the harvest."

184
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,440
 And so they agree to work for one denarius,

185
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,560
 which basically was enough money to pay for food

186
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,960
 for the family for that day.

187
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,760
 But then what's interesting is that the landowner

188
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,040
 actually keeps going out, and it's also interesting

189
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,600
 that the landowner does that.

190
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,240
 You know, it's him going out and hiring workers,

191
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,600
 not somebody else, not one of his employees, but he does it.

192
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,560
 And so there's other people he meets,

193
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,220
 and they agree that they will be paid

194
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,300
 whatever is right, in verse four.

195
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,260
 And so he tells them, "I'll pay you something that's fair."

196
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,140
 And then he goes out at five o'clock,

197
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,500
 which by this time, there's only one hour left in workday,

198
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,180
 so workdays usually were 12 hours.

199
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,740
 So there's only one hour left.

200
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,660
 And he still finds people standing around,

201
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,860
 and he's kind of confused by that.

202
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,680
 He's like, "Why are they standing around?

203
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,540
 "Why are you doing nothing?"

204
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,740
 And they say, "No one has hired us."

205
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,620
 Now, no one, in other words, wants them.

206
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,520
 When I lived in the US, I one time rode along

207
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,860
 with a contractor who actually picked up workers.

208
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,420
 You know, there was a place where they were waiting

209
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,620
 for work for the day.

210
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,140
 And it was interesting because the contractors

211
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,260
 actually get to know the workers.

212
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,580
 And then a lot of times, they know who they like

213
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,060
 to work with, but they also know maybe the person

214
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,160
 who doesn't work that well.

215
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,500
 And so I can imagine in the setting,

216
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,100
 you know, the workers, they knew these guys,

217
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,580
 and they're like, "Ah, we don't want them working for us."

218
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,080
 So they didn't hire them, but they hired the other guys.

219
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,180
 But this landowner, he hires them nonetheless for one hour.

220
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,080
 So it's interesting.

221
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,340
 It's kind of something precarious,

222
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,400
 something that should make us curious.

223
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,400
 So at the end of the day, 12 hours worked.

224
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,600
 You know, you have people working different hours.

225
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,840
 Some work 12, and some work one hour.

226
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,000
 Now, we have to remember that this is a parable

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,880
 because it's easy to kind of lose track of that.

228
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,160
 So in this parable, the landowner is God

229
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,280
 who's calling people into his kingdom

230
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,760
 to be his kingdom workers.

231
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,480
 So that's something we need to keep in mind

232
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,920
 as we continue walking through it, okay?

233
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,760
 But let's go on, and this is where things get interesting,

234
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,960
 the next part.

235
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,680
 This is where it gets juicy, as they say.

236
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,320
 So in verse eight to six, we see that the landowner

237
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
 tells the foreman, "Call the people together.

238
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,760
 "I wanna pay them."

239
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,200
 And he decides to pay them from those who came last.

240
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,920
 He wants to pay them first, and then, you know,

241
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,040
 pay all of them after the first one.

242
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,160
 And then, you know, pay all of them

243
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,440
 until the ones who started in the morning.

244
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,880
 Now, what's absolutely incredible

245
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,600
 is that the landowner pays those who came

246
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,800
 and worked for one hour.

247
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,720
 He pays them one denarius, which is the same

248
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,840
 that he had agreed upon, you know, for the others.

249
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,640
 And this kind of stirs some excitement.

250
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,500
 Actually, at this point in time, nobody minds that,

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
 that they're getting paid a denarius

252
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,280
 because they are expecting that they will receive more.

253
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:29,620
 But when it's their turn to pay, to be paid,

254
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,460
 guess what happens, right?

255
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,400
 We already read it.

256
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,200
 They just get one denarius.

257
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,040
 Ooh.

258
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,760
 They worked 12 hours, the other ones worked one hour,

259
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,280
 and they get paid the same.

260
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,600
 I don't know if you've ever, like,

261
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,120
 been in a work situation where you do a lot more,

262
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,880
 maybe somebody else is chilling and playing video games,

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,920
 and you get paid the same.

264
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,820
 It just doesn't feel good, does it?

265
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,680
 I also, if this was today, I wonder, like,

266
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,000
 what people would do on social media, right?

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
 Like, they might go on X.

268
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
 Is that what it's called?

269
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,200
 Twitter, is it called X?

270
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,040
 I can't remember.

271
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,560
 Okay, yeah, so they go on X, you know,

272
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,520
 shoot out some tweets.

273
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,980
 If there was Google Review,

274
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,440
 they would write a nasty review about this, you know,

275
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
 horrible landowner who is so unfair.

276
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,200
 And I think we can feel, we can have sympathy with that.

277
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,840
 There does seem to be some unfairness

278
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,760
 from our perspective, right?

279
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,280
 So, and we can feel that.

280
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,040
 So it's no surprise then that they actually grumble

281
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,880
 and they complain.

282
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,320
 So in verse 11, we're told they begin to grumble

283
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,960
 against the landowner, so they're angry against them.

284
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,380
 And then in verse 12, we're told,

285
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,580
 these who were hired last worked only one hour, they said,

286
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,060
 and you have made them equal to us,

287
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,140
 and who have borne the burden of the work

288
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,620
 and the heat of the day.

289
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,500
 You know, hey, you're making them the same as us,

290
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,260
 but we earned, we deserve more than them.

291
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,540
 We earned this, we have the right to this.

292
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,560
 You know, that's what they're saying.

293
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,540
 Like, we're not equal to these other guys

294
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,260
 that nobody wanted to hire that just worked one hour.

295
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,240
 We should get more.

296
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,920
 And they're just ticked off.

297
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,480
 But I want you to notice something.

298
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,720
 All of this grumbling and frustration,

299
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,080
 the only reason why it happens

300
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,960
 is because they're comparing themselves.

301
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,480
 If the foreman would have paid the first comers first

302
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
 and sent them off, they would have gotten

303
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,160
 what they agreed upon, right?

304
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,440
 One denarius and they go and they would have been happy.

305
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,680
 But it was only when they compared themselves

306
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,880
 that they got angry and frustrated

307
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,060
 and felt like they were treated wrongly.

308
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:52,040
 So comparison can turn something that is good

309
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,240
 into something sour.

310
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,960
 It's like me with basketball.

311
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,660
 I was proud to be on the team.

312
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,000
 I felt amazing.

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
 I made the college basketball team.

314
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,840
 But then when I compared myself to the one guy

315
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,320
 who was like similar skill level,

316
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,400
 looking back, he was better than me, just being honest.

317
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,120
 But when I compared myself,

318
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
 then I was grumbling, then I was complaining,

319
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,320
 and suddenly something that was good

320
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,520
 didn't feel that good.

321
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,160
 And my joy was drained.

322
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,920
 But then, let's continue the story.

323
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,520
 So the landowner, he actually responds in verse 30.

324
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,780
 He says, "But he answered one of them,

325
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,500
 "I'm not being unfair to you, friend.

326
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,220
 "Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?"

327
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,820
 He reminds him of the facts.

328
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,460
 "Take your pay and go.

329
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,660
 "I wanna give the ones who was hired the last

330
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,560
 "the same as I gave you.

331
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,340
 "Don't I have the right to do what I want

332
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,000
 "with my own money?

333
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,900
 "Or are you envious because I am generous?"

334
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,740
 Now it's interesting because the workers,

335
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,820
 they're actually claiming that the landlord

336
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,440
 is unjust and unfair.

337
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,060
 That he is treating them wrongly.

338
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,780
 But he's saying, "I've actually done what I promised you.

339
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,300
 "You agreed to this."

340
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,620
 And so he's highlighting that.

341
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,100
 And they're trying to make this about a justice issue,

342
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,000
 and he shifts it and he says,

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,340
 "You're upset, you're envious because I'm generous."

344
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,940
 So he's saying, "This is not about justice.

345
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,920
 "This is about envy.

346
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,020
 "This is about my generosity

347
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,820
 "with which you struggle with,

348
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,640
 "which you don't want for the other person.

349
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,340
 "That's why you're upset."

350
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,380
 Ay-yah.

351
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,540
 This is where we get to the heart issue

352
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,980
 that Jesus wants to address.

353
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,220
 That he wanted to address in Peter,

354
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,860
 that he wants to address in us.

355
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,880
 He asks the question, "Or are you envious

356
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,140
 "because I'm generous?"

357
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,740
 And the truth is they are envious because he is generous.

358
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:18,940
 They are envious of the grace and mercy

359
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,420
 that the workers that nobody wants to hire,

360
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,140
 that maybe are not as skilled,

361
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,640
 that look like they have a messy life,

362
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,820
 that maybe smell like alcohol,

363
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,980
 don't look the way we think somebody

364
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,180
 who is a good worker looks

365
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,480
 because the landowner showed them grace and mercy.

366
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,320
 That's why they're ticked off.

367
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
 Now, at this point in time, again, we have to remember,

368
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,880
 we're reading a parable.

369
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,660
 This is not a workplace situation.

370
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,400
 This is Jesus using life circumstance

371
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,700
 to explain something else.

372
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:59,720
 And so Jesus, in this parable, as I already said,

373
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,540
 the landowner represents God,

374
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,180
 and it's actually God calling people into his kingdom,

375
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,260
 inviting them to be workers in his kingdom,

376
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,420
 inviting them to give them some work in the vineyard.

377
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,220
 So when you're a Christian, God has called you

378
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,060
 and he has given you a place in the vineyard

379
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,300
 to work, every one of us.

380
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,400
 And it is all by the grace and by the mercy of God.

381
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,520
 None of us deserve it.

382
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,620
 None of us are entitled to it.

383
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,620
 It is 100% the grace of God that he calls us

384
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,820
 and that we get to be part of his family,

385
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,400
 that we get to be his workers in the vineyard.

386
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:52,500
 But the reason the early workers in this parable

387
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,340
 are so upset because they have forgotten that.

388
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,180
 And guess what?

389
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,300
 We forget that as well.

390
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,860
 And we start actually thinking about our relationship

391
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,220
 with God a lot of times as we think about relationships

392
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,500
 in business.

393
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,700
 You know, they're transactional.

394
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,600
 You owe me something.

395
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,700
 I did this, God, and you owe me this.

396
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,080
 Why should he or she have this?

397
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,740
 I have done this.

398
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,140
 I am entitled to that, but you're not giving it to me.

399
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,580
 And so we start grumbling against the landowners.

400
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,140
 We start grumbling against God.

401
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,260
 And our relationship with God starts growing sour

402
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,820
 'cause we have lost sight that this whole thing

403
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,220
 is all by the mercy, by the grace, by the love,

404
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,980
 by the generosity of God.

405
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:52,500
 In the kingdom of God, it isn't about earning or deserving,

406
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,620
 but about receiving, saving grace, and joyfully serving God.

407
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,920
 (audience members clapping)

408
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,780
 Now, what does all this have to do with us?

409
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,780
 I know I was just walking us through the story,

410
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,700
 trying to help us understand some of the details

411
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,260
 a little bit better.

412
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,120
 But what is it that this parable exposes

413
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,420
 and challenges within our hearts?

414
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,960
 And what does Jesus call us to instead?

415
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,800
 Well, the first thing is we theoretically love grace.

416
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
 We theoretically like it.

417
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,280
 We like it when God is gracious to us,

418
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,200
 when he's good to us.

419
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,640
 Oh, thank you, God, for the promotion.

420
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
 Hallelujah, praise the Lord.

421
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,520
 Thank you, God, for this that you've done in my life.

422
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,700
 I love you, you're amazing.

423
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,160
 So we love grace theoretically.

424
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,000
 Well, we start not liking it when God's generosity

425
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
 and goodness comes to somebody else,

426
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,480
 when it comes to our competitor,

427
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
 when it comes to the other family member,

428
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,280
 when it comes to, you know, what you can fill in the blank.

429
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,960
 So theoretically, we like grace.

430
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,680
 We're like, yeah, I love grace, we're a grace church.

431
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,920
 But then when it actually comes down to it,

432
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,520
 a lot of times we don't like it.

433
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,960
 Is this true?

434
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,560
 Yeah, I think so, right?

435
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,720
 Come on.

436
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,740
 Just having honest conversation here.

437
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,120
 And so perhaps we envy a relationship,

438
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,360
 a promotion, success, praise,

439
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,680
 gifts that people have, scholarships they've been awarded,

440
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,100
 favors, you know, from someone you can fill in the blank.

441
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:41,360
 You know, where have you envied God's generosity

442
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,460
 towards somebody else?

443
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:48,320
 Where do you find yourself being envious right now

444
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,560
 and comparing yourself and feeling like you are entitled,

445
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,920
 they shouldn't be entitled?

446
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,240
 And by the way, I chose a very safe example

447
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,160
 with the basketball team on purpose,

448
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,960
 you know, keeping it light and easy.

449
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,760
 Where are you envious right now?

450
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,800
 Where you feel like you deserve something,

451
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,300
 God owes you something.

452
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:17,300
 You know, and when we compare ourselves to others,

453
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,500
 the legalistic religion within ourselves

454
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
 actually is exposed.

455
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,160
 When I say I deserve this, why is God giving the person that?

456
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,260
 Really what we're saying is I earned this.

457
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,300
 But as we've said, you know, everything from God

458
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,020
 is something we get by grace, by his mercy.

459
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,260
 It's not something that we earn,

460
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,320
 you know, we just receive it by grace and mercy.

461
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,700
 But so it exposes our heart that actually,

462
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,020
 there's some works religion in there, in us.

463
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,980
 You know that, and this is what Jesus

464
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,340
 is kind of teasing out in Peter's heart,

465
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,180
 in his listeners heart, in our heart.

466
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:04,540
 And we say that person should not be of equal status to me,

467
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,380
 I should be of higher status, you know,

468
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,300
 because I did so and so and that person

469
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,220
 is not the same as me, you know,

470
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,000
 and we go on and on and on.

471
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,900
 So you will never see the goodness of God

472
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,480
 when you envy his generosity towards others.

473
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,820
 It gives you a tunnel vision.

474
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,180
 You lose track of it.

475
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,820
 Now I don't know if you've, you know,

476
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,860
 if you struggle with that, it's a real struggle.

477
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,340
 We, you know, sometimes it is hard to get out of that.

478
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,020
 And I actually want us to be compassionate

479
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,260
 and graceful towards one another,

480
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,840
 even when we find ourselves in those places.

481
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,340
 You know, but it's, when you're so focused

482
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,340
 on what somebody else has and you haven't

483
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,900
 and you feel like you deserve it,

484
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,620
 man, you start losing track of all the goodness

485
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,860
 of God in your life.

486
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,380
 You're not able to see it.

487
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,820
 And it's just, it's just not a good place.

488
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,620
 And God doesn't want us to live in that place.

489
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,860
 You know, he wants us to see his goodness,

490
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,180
 his love, his grace, his mercy.

491
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,180
 He wants you to see it, he wants you to know it.

492
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,140
 He wants you to be confident in it.

493
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,720
 He is faithful to you, his people.

494
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,940
 But you will never see the goodness of God

495
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,920
 when you are envy his generosity towards others.

496
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,100
 So what's the antidote to that?

497
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
 What do we do?

498
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,540
 How can we get out of this comparison trap

499
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,380
 that leaves us being jealous and envious?

500
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:42,520
 Well, the antidote is that we start practicing

501
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,520
 and seeing and giving thanks to God's goodness and mercy.

502
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,760
 That we cultivate this attitude of gratitude.

503
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,680
 I came up with another way right before the sermon,

504
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,740
 that we practice the art of seeing God's goodness

505
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,600
 in our lives.

506
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,640
 You know, we struggle with that.

507
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,680
 But when we do that and we start giving God thanks

508
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,020
 for, wow, God, thank you for your mercy,

509
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,920
 thank you for salvation, thank you for your faithfulness,

510
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,000
 thank you that you are with me, that I know your presence.

511
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,560
 Thank you that I'm breathing today,

512
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,920
 thank you for my health, thank you for whatever God

513
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,200
 is being good to you, just give him thanks.

514
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,200
 You know, it's amazing when we do that.

515
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,580
 Now, there's a biblical scholar, Michael J. Wilkins,

516
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,120
 he defines gratitude this way.

517
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,840
 He says, "Gratitude is the response of the believing person

518
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,040
 "to the goodness of God's grace in creation

519
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,120
 "and redemption, making gratitude the authentic hallmark

520
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,100
 "of the disciple of Jesus."

521
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,460
 So gratitude, so our thanks, our praise is a response

522
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,500
 to Jesus and our lives are meant to be a response

523
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,400
 to the goodness, to the mercy of God,

524
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,920
 where we say thank you, Jesus, for placing,

525
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,620
 for calling me into your vineyard.

526
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,520
 And I'm gonna serve you in this patch that you put me in

527
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,920
 and I believe that you have a purpose for me

528
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,600
 here in this patch, that you don't make mistakes

529
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,040
 and I'm gonna joyfully serve you and work for you.

530
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,600
 And I'm not gonna be focused on rewards or who gets what,

531
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 I'm just gonna live in gratitude of your generosity,

532
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,640
 you know, towards me, your goodness towards me.

533
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,880
 And you know, when we do that,

534
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,960
 there's something really freeing.

535
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,500
 When we just know that God loves us, that we are secure,

536
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,080
 that we're not gonna miss out, that he cares for us,

537
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,600
 that he has our back, it just frees us to love other people,

538
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,320
 to serve him and not be concerned, you know,

539
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,960
 about us being entitled to this or to that.

540
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,040
 And if I only had this, you know,

541
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,320
 then I'd be happy and all of that.

542
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,720
 Or he should not have that and she should not have that.

543
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,520
 Like there's, it's just amazing, you know,

544
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,780
 when we live in this gratitude and just see God's mercy,

545
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,760
 that we're just freed to love other people,

546
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,180
 to do the work of God that he gives us

547
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,180
 and to just enjoy his goodness.

548
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:17,460
 Now, I was at a point in my life where this was not easy.

549
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:24,920
 It's not always easy to have the attitude of gratitude.

550
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,520
 And maybe if you're really feeling bad,

551
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,360
 and somebody tells you,

552
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,200
 you should have the attitude of gratitude.

553
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,560
 You know, you're like, hmm,

554
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,280
 I don't know if I wanna hear this right now.

555
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,280
 (audience laughing)

556
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,500
 So I've shared, you know, some of the story before,

557
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,700
 but basically, you know, several years ago,

558
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,660
 I had significant loss of my life,

559
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,660
 loss of relationship, loss of home, loss of my job.

560
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,520
 And, you know, really I was like, God, I'm serving you.

561
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,280
 You know, I was a pastor.

562
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,920
 I love you.

563
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,840
 Like, why is my life falling apart?

564
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,160
 And why do people maybe who seem like

565
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,320
 they don't care about you that much,

566
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,480
 why are they doing good?

567
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,320
 This is so unfair.

568
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,780
 You know, I deserve this.

569
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,240
 So I was complaining.

570
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,200
 I was grumbling.

571
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,080
 And I have to say, you know,

572
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,720
 sometimes when just our life knocks us down,

573
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,180
 sometimes that's where we're at.

574
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,400
 You know, it's not like we can always,

575
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,520
 I always ride away in the ideal place,

576
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,160
 you know, but that's where I was.

577
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,160
 And it's, but it's interesting when we, you know,

578
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,080
 say why do they have such a good life?

579
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,800
 Actually, the reality is,

580
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,920
 do we really know that they have a good life?

581
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:53,900
 Do we know that they don't have marital problems?

582
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,400
 Do we know that they're not lonely in the evening

583
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,780
 and there's tears every night?

584
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,800
 Do we not, do we know

585
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,880
 that they're not carrying some baggage from the past

586
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,680
 that's just heavy and that's just impacting them even today?

587
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,440
 You know, is that other person's life,

588
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,420
 is it really better?

589
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,920
 And, and that, because we just see the facade, right?

590
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,600
 That, that we are jealous of,

591
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,320
 and like, why is God generous to this person?

592
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,920
 But if we actually would swap lives like completely,

593
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,720
 maybe their life is really not that great.

594
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,400
 Maybe God's just, you know,

595
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,320
 pouring out some goodness in this area of their lives

596
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,960
 just to encourage them because the rest is so difficult.

597
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,920
 But anyhow, I was, I was not thinking this way,

598
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,320
 you know, it's like, why, why do they have a good life?

599
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,200
 And right now my life is a mess.

600
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,540
 And so I was talking to a friend

601
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,840
 and I was, you know, sharing all this stuff with him.

602
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,400
 And he was encouraging me to see God's goodness.

603
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,040
 I have to say, he did listen to me several times.

604
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,240
 Then only after a while,

605
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,960
 it was like after three conversations,

606
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,880
 or he started to talk to me about seeing God's goodness.

607
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,280
 It was not the first thing he told me.

608
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,920
 And I shared with him that there was a family

609
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,400
 that took me in, you know, as I had lost my relationship,

610
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,120
 my home, my job, that they welcomed me into their home.

611
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,180
 And my goal was, I'm just gonna be here.

612
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,920
 I'm gonna hide in this room

613
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,360
 so that they allow me to stay here longer,

614
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,720
 that they don't get annoyed and want me out of the house,

615
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,000
 you know, just try to clean up everything, good.

616
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
 But they didn't just want me in their house,

617
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,880
 they actually invited me to be part of their family.

618
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,580
 I had dinner with them, I went shopping with them,

619
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,800
 I went wine tasting with them, which was a lot of fun.

620
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:54,120
 You know, they just really loved me and embraced me

621
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,440
 in this difficult time where I was like a mess,

622
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,040
 crying and all of that.

623
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,320
 And my friend says, "Don't you see how much God loves you?

624
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,120
 "How he's showing you his goodness

625
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,320
 "in this difficult time through his family?

626
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,460
 "Don't you see that?"

627
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,960
 Wow.

628
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,300
 And I really needed that because I couldn't see it on my own.

629
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,000
 And I could see God's goodness,

630
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,960
 and this was a turning point for me,

631
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,720
 where I could start giving God thanks

632
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,560
 and praise him for his love and care for me,

633
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,040
 despite the difficulties and the challenges

634
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,400
 that were going on.

635
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,040
 I was just saying, "Thank you, thank you, Lord."

636
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,240
 And I started slowly naming the things

637
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,000
 in which God has been good to me.

638
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,120
 (pages rustling)

639
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:58,560
 Now, when we have God's grace and mercy in view,

640
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,000
 when we get to see it, it is so powerful.

641
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,320
 Now, for me, there was this complaining against God.

642
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,200
 Now, I don't think that I saw God as like, you know,

643
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,480
 the evil landowner who's so unjust to me,

644
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,520
 but it was a little bit of that.

645
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,240
 And it's amazing when we see God's grace and mercy,

646
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,220
 we actually can start seeing God again as a loving father,

647
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,480
 instead of as that evil landowner who's just harsh to us

648
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,400
 and who messes with our lives, you know,

649
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,060
 and where we're upset and we're angry and we're sour.

650
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,920
 And he wants to restore that.

651
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,400
 You know, he wants to restore our relationship with him.

652
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,680
 He wants to restore our joy.

653
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,700
 He doesn't want us to live in this place

654
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,220
 of envy and complaining.

655
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,160
 And now one thing that's also amazing about Jesus,

656
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,440
 you know, his saving work is that he gives us forgiveness.

657
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,080
 'Cause actually when we're complaining,

658
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,520
 when we're saying, why are you giving them that and not me?

659
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,960
 You know, there's actually pride in our hearts.

660
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,860
 We actually need forgiveness for that.

661
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,680
 You know, and he forgives us

662
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,000
 and he gives us his mercy and his grace.

663
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,140
 And he actually helps us overcome, you know,

664
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,660
 that so that we can be free,

665
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,620
 that we can receive his grace and his mercy and goodness

666
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,300
 and just walk in that.

667
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,340
 Now, I want to invite the worship team to come up.

668
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:34,140
 And my sense, you know, for today is, you know,

669
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,780
 as I shared, Jesus, he tells these parables

670
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,540
 to just highlight things in our hearts

671
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,520
 where he's inviting us to have a different perspective,

672
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,120
 where he wants to also bring healing, you know,

673
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,780
 the parts of our thinking, parts of our acting

674
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,400
 that are not aligned with him.

675
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:57,180
 And he's inviting us today, he's inviting you today,

676
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:04,420
 you know, to respond to him, to come to him.

677
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:09,420
 Maybe it's asking Jesus, I'm not seeing your goodness.

678
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,180
 I'm not seeing your, you know,

679
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,100
 what I should be grateful for.

680
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,240
 Can you help me see it?

681
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,420
 Maybe that's what you bring to him.

682
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,460
 And I believe that he will help you see it, you know,

683
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,980
 as you ask him for that,

684
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,020
 that he will show you, you know, his goodness.

685
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,220
 Maybe not right in the moment,

686
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,040
 but he will highlight that to you.

687
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,780
 Maybe it's, maybe God wants to restore

688
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,020
 your relationship with him.

689
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,780
 Maybe you've been sour, you've been bitter,

690
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,860
 you've been angry at God.

691
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,300
 Like, how dare God do this to me?

692
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,460
 You know, why does he give,

693
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,580
 it's generous to them, but not to me?

694
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,560
 And so maybe God is calling some of you,

695
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,020
 you know, just to find healing in that relationship.

696
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,620
 To not see God as this angry, unfair,

697
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,820
 unjust taskmaster in your life,

698
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,180
 but as your heavenly father who loves you,

699
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,340
 you know, who cares for you,

700
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,920
 who just pours his mercy and his goodness out over you.

701
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,140
 And so what I wanna do right now,

702
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,460
 I just wanna invite you actually

703
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,620
 to just talk to God right now,

704
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,620
 and just to talk to him about

705
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,460
 what he's been speaking to you about.

706
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,020
 And then in a little bit, I'll lead us into what's next.

707
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,420
 So let's do that right now.

708
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,860
 (gentle music)

709
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,280
 (gentle music continues)

710
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,700
 (gentle music continues)

711
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,120
 (gentle music continues)

712
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,540
 (gentle music continues)

713
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,960
 (gentle music continues)

714
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,380
 (gentle music continues)

715
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,800
 (gentle music continues)

716
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,220
 (gentle music continues)

717
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,640
 (gentle music continues)

718
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:16,040
 (gentle music continues)

719
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:29,460
 (gentle music continues)

720
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,880
 (gentle music continues)

721
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,320
 Thank you, Jesus.

722
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,220
 Thank you, Jesus.

723
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:46,340
 Wanna encourage you right now to transition

724
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,300
 to telling Jesus what you're thankful for.

725
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,120
 Just name the things that you're grateful for in your life.

726
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,220
 Things that you know he's done for you,

727
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,660
 he has provided for you.

728
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,860
 Just tell him right now.

729
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,220
 Jesus, I thank you for everything.

730
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:12,080
 Thank you, Jesus.

731
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,660
 Thank you, Jesus.

732
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,380
 I wanna invite everyone to stand.

733
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:22,700
 I would love to just pray over you

734
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,900
 as a posture of just desiring to receive from God.

735
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,660
 You can stretch out your hand to express that

736
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,620
 if you would like.

737
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,320
 And let me just pray over you.

738
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,740
 Jesus, thank you

739
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,840
 that you love us,

740
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,900
 that you don't withhold anything good from us,

741
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,380
 that you died for us

742
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,620
 so that we can become workers in you every day,

743
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,640
 we can be part of your family.

744
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,060
 Thank you that your grace doesn't stop there,

745
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,840
 but it is your mercies and your grace

746
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,540
 that is new every morning.

747
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:11,060
 You show us your goodness every single day.

748
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,700
 Lord, but we, a lot of times, we struggle to see it.

749
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,820
 So I pray for those right now

750
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,380
 who are struggling to see your goodness.

751
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,860
 I pray that you would reveal it to them,

752
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,540
 that you'd show it to them, your goodness, your love,

753
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,780
 that just like my friend came alongside me, Lord,

754
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,140
 that Holy Spirit, you would come alongside them,

755
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,820
 just highlight the goodness in their lives,

756
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:39,780
 where you are good, that you would show us that,

757
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,140
 that you would reveal that.

758
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,420
 And I pray that you lead us out of this comparison thinking.

759
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,260
 Where we're just stuck, maybe we don't know what to do.

760
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,500
 And we don't ourselves like it,

761
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,660
 but we don't know what else to do.

762
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,460
 I pray for freedom in your name, Jesus.

763
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,940
 I pray that you release us from this comparisons envy

764
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,260
 and that you replace it with joy and gratitude in you,

765
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,660
 that you lift our spirits,

766
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,660
 that you allow us to joyfully just worship and to serve you.

767
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,820
 Strengthen your people, Lord, strengthen us,

768
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,820
 move in our hearts, move in our minds,

769
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,380
 help us align ourselves with you.

770
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:27,100
 Be people who rejoice when you are generous to others.

771
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,700
 Help us not to be bitter.

772
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,440
 Thank you, Jesus.

773
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,340
 So I pray all that in your name, Jesus, amen.

774
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,440
 Let's worship church.

775
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
