1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 - Hey guys, Pastor John and Sandra,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,320
 they've been with us for a long time.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,440
 He's one of our founding pastors, if you didn't know.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,600
 And I hear that you are taking a few months off

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,240
 to spend time with family in UK.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,840
 And so actually to have them with us today,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,640
 it's a joy.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,360
 And so I'm gonna pray for John, I'm gonna pray for us.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,620
 So pray with us.

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,400
 Father, we thank you for John and Sandra.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,840
 We thank you for not just the ministry that they've given,

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,720
 Lord God, but their lives.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,560
 Lord God, thank you for saving them many, many years ago

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,880
 and thank you for using them.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,480
 Thank you for continuing to remind us through them

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,360
 what your love looks like,

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,520
 how to live faithfully in this world

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,760
 that seems getting, it seems more and more complex,

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
 Lord God.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,800
 But today here we are and we ask, Lord God,

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,600
 for you to speak your living words through your servant,

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,840
 John, your friend, John, our brother, John, our pastor, John.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,880
 And so Jesus, we're excited and we receive this with joy

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,040
 and anticipation.

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
 Holy Spirit, would you move through all of us.

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,040
 In your name we pray, amen.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,880
 - Amen.

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,320
 Let's go have a hug.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,800
 Thank you.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,220
 You know, it's possible to overdose

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,240
 on church services and religion.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,600
 Look at my own story.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,200
 I didn't come from a Christian family,

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,160
 but I was sent to Christian schools,

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,800
 Christian primary school and Christian secondary school.

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,680
 And one of the things about schools,

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
 particularly in the UK at that time,

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
 was that every day had to start

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,520
 with an act of Christian assembly.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,920
 Don't ask me what they said, I can't remember any of it,

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,840
 but I did calculate that I probably attended

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,700
 2,500 plus assemblies.

43
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,120
 Now, the only days we didn't do assemblies

44
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,420
 was special days like Saint's Days or Thanksgiving,

45
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,700
 where we went to church.

46
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,700
 And I recall my primary school was called St. Peter's School

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,820
 and it was St. Peter's Day.

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,640
 And so we went to St. Peter's Church.

49
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,700
 But it had come just after my birthday

50
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,960
 and I'd recently started supporting a football team,

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,200
 a soccer team for you Americans, called Tottenham Hotspur.

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,720
 And someone had bought me a Tottenham Hotspur diary.

53
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,560
 And I decided that a Tottenham Hotspur diary

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,920
 was a lot more interesting to read

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,320
 than the church service was.

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,400
 Unfortunately, my headmaster did not agree.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,680
 So when we got back to the school,

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,960
 I was called into his room and as happened in those days,

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,880
 he got his stick out and two strokes of the cane.

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,040
 And I thought to myself, man,

61
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,660
 this was so much more interesting than the church service.

62
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,840
 And for many years, I had this feeling

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,160
 that God was like this.

64
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,660
 God was like a headmaster who was waiting

65
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,840
 to see what I did wrong.

66
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
 The other thing about those services at that time,

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
 the assemblies and the services,

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,960
 they use words I did not understand.

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,960
 Words like omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent.

70
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,480
 If you play Scrabble, that's a lot of points,

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,520
 I've got to tell you.

72
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,180
 Now I later learned that omniscient means all knowing.

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,360
 Omnipresent means all present.

74
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,960
 Why didn't they just say all present?

75
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,280
 Omnipotent meant all powerful.

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,880
 Now, why do I bring this up?

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,880
 Well, today I have selected Psalm 139.

78
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,680
 I guess you've gathered that by now.

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,760
 I love this Psalm.

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,200
 It was written by King David, like Psalm 23.

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
 And Psalm 139 demonstrates all of these,

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
 especially the first two.

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,080
 And I believe it leads us to another omni

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,600
 that perhaps is even more important.

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,480
 And that word is omnibenevolent.

86
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,440
 What it means is all good.

87
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,720
 And if you wanna fall asleep for the rest of the sermon,

88
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,240
 that's okay, 'cause what I'm gonna tell you today

89
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,520
 can be summed in three words.

90
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,080
 God is good.

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,920
 That's worth an amen, I think.

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,440
 God is good.

93
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,240
 Now Bible teachers will tell you

94
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,040
 that of all the 150 Psalms,

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,200
 Psalm 139 is the one that best describes

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,280
 God's personal relationship with us.

97
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,700
 The idea that God is not far off,

98
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,400
 but is near to each one of us.

99
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,840
 As a kid, did you ever play hide and seek?

100
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,340
 Do you remember hide and seek?

101
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,920
 I can remember just a few years ago

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,400
 when my grandkids were very, very small.

103
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,720
 I mean, hide and seek took a very different angle.

104
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
 So when I went to hide,

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,820
 I had to hide very close so they could see me,

106
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,800
 because if they couldn't find me in a nanosecond,

107
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,740
 they would panic.

108
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,840
 But when it was their turn to hide,

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,240
 as I turned around, I could already see them.

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,740
 But you have to play a little game

111
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,760
 for about two or three minutes.

112
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,060
 I can't see you.

113
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,680
 I need to tell you today,

114
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,000
 you cannot play hide and seek with God.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,640
 You see, the first thing that we learn from Psalm 139

116
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,140
 is that God sees everything about me.

117
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,380
 Let's start by reading the first four verses.

118
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,440
 Lord, you have searched me and you know me.

119
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,980
 You know when I sit and when I rise.

120
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,600
 You perceive my thoughts from afar.

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,240
 You discern my going out and my lying down.

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,100
 You are familiar with all my ways.

123
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,640
 Before a word is in my tongue,

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,740
 you know it completely, oh Lord.

125
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,120
 Lord, you have searched me and you know me.

126
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,400
 Now the word search literally means to examine,

127
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,280
 to examine with pain and care.

128
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,220
 Jewish people used it to describe digging deep into a mine

129
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,760
 or exploring a land or investigating a legal case.

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:58,200
 These verses describe God's omniscience,

131
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,140
 which as I said, means all knowing.

132
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,460
 My friends, God knows everything.

133
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,600
 Friends may see us from the outside,

134
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,160
 but God sees our hearts.

135
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
 Hebrews 4:13 says,

136
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,600
 nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.

137
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,900
 Everything is uncovered and laid bare to him

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,660
 to whom we must give an account.

139
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,700
 I love general knowledge quizzes.

140
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,820
 I'm a good person to have on your team,

141
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,740
 particularly if you want to answer questions on pop music

142
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,100
 from around 1965 to 1990.

143
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,500
 Just a tip.

144
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,860
 But I get so frustrated sometimes

145
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,500
 when I'm on a general knowledge quiz,

146
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,980
 I'm watching one on TV

147
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,220
 and I feel I should know the answer, but I don't.

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,100
 I need to tell you,

149
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,340
 there is no question that God cannot answer.

150
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,860
 No problem that confuses him.

151
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,380
 He's never surprised.

152
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,580
 He's never shocked.

153
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,700
 He never says, oh really?

154
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:26,960
 These verses list three specific areas

155
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,500
 that concern you and me.

156
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 First it says in verse three,

157
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,820
 you know when I sit down and when I rise,

158
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,780
 you discern my going out and my lying down.

159
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,260
 You are familiar with all my ways.

160
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,780
 In other words, God knows everything we do.

161
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,560
 He knows when I plop into my armchair to watch Netflix.

162
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,960
 And he knows when I get up to get some more nibbles

163
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,640
 and soda.

164
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,160
 Okay, some more beer, sorry.

165
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,300
 Now talking of which, he knows all our habits.

166
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,960
 He knows our good habits and our bad habits,

167
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,200
 our weak areas and our strong ones.

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,600
 He sees them all.

169
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,340
 Actually, he knows them better than you do.

170
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:24,160
 Also verse four says, before a word is on my tongue,

171
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,540
 you know it completely, oh Lord.

172
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,320
 God knows every word we say.

173
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,760
 He doesn't just know it after we say it.

174
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,000
 He knows it before we say it.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
 Now, if you're like me, this is a problem

176
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,920
 because I often open my mouth

177
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,200
 without engaging my brain first.

178
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,840
 Like I say things like England are gonna win the Euros.

179
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,580
 And then I think, God, you already knew

180
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,060
 when I was gonna say that.

181
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,480
 And you knew I was gonna regret it.

182
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,460
 Couldn't you cut like that just to warn me in advance

183
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,220
 so that I could keep my mouth shut?

184
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,980
 The third thing that God knows in verse two,

185
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,560
 you perceive my thoughts from afar.

186
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,040
 God knows everything we've ever thought about.

187
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,480
 Oh, think about that for a moment.

188
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,640
 Oh, God knows you just thought about that.

189
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,400
 How can you grasp a God who knows every thought

190
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,720
 that you've ever had?

191
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,560
 Plus those of 7.7 billion people in the world.

192
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,480
 It's hard to take in.

193
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,900
 Now, if God sees and knows everything I do or even think,

194
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,160
 now, what does that mean to me?

195
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,680
 That means He has enormous power

196
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,020
 to encourage me in what's right.

197
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,500
 He has enormous power to help me in temptation.

198
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,280
 He knows exactly the struggle that is going on in my mind.

199
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,560
 He sees it coming before I see it coming.

200
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,080
 And He's already preparing an escape route

201
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,180
 so I can get away from temptation.

202
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,020
 And because God sees me when I'm tempted,

203
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,700
 that's a motivation for me not to give in.

204
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:36,040
 I don't want to sin when He's watching me.

205
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,020
 You know, it's human nature.

206
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,600
 If you know a police car sitting there, you don't speed.

207
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,080
 Oh, it's so funny in Hong Kong.

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,760
 I mean, you know where I live,

209
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,280
 we go off the Dingao Bridge

210
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,520
 and then we go onto like a four-way freeway,

211
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,280
 but the limit is 70 kilometres an hour

212
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,720
 on a four-lane freeway.

213
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,040
 It's incredible.

214
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,440
 And there's this orange box which tells you it's speeding.

215
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,880
 I love watching the cars one by one,

216
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,600
 the brake lights going on.

217
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,160
 It's amazing.

218
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,280
 If you know your boss is watching,

219
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,840
 you don't play Fortnite on your computer at work.

220
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,840
 So when I'm tempted, God wants to help me out.

221
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,720
 I'll tell you something, this coming week,

222
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,360
 I'm gonna face some temptation.

223
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,960
 So are you.

224
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,280
 I don't know when it will come.

225
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,080
 I don't know what it will be, but God does.

226
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,120
 God already knows about it

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,880
 and He's already prepared an escape route

228
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,720
 away out of temptation.

229
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,760
 So that's number one, God sees everything about me.

230
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,920
 The second thing we learn from this Psalm

231
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,280
 is that God is continually with me.

232
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,040
 Verse five,

233
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,160
 you hem me in,

234
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,200
 behind and before.

235
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
 You've laid your hand upon me.

236
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,560
 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,

237
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,280
 too lofty for me to attain.

238
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,040
 Where can I go from your Spirit?

239
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,720
 Where can I flee from your presence?

240
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,200
 If I go up to the heavens, you're there.

241
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,000
 If I make my bed in the depths, you're there.

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
 If I rise on the wings of the dawn,

243
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,240
 if I settle on the far side of the sea,

244
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,640
 even there your hand will guide me,

245
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,960
 your right hand will hold me fast.

246
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,000
 If I say, surely the darkness will hide me

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,360
 and the light will become night around me.

248
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,160
 Even the darkness will not be dark to you.

249
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,080
 The night will shine like the day

250
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,800
 for darkness is as light to you.

251
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,040
 Now this phrase, hem me in,

252
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,400
 can be translated as to God, a valuable object.

253
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
 You know, if you're on a jewelry show or something,

254
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,400
 to God that would be to hem it in.

255
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,400
 These verses describe God's omnipresence,

256
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,320
 which as I said, simply means all present.

257
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,400
 It means that God is present everywhere

258
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,000
 in the universe at the same time.

259
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,160
 Not a little bit of Him here, a little bit there.

260
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,160
 No, He's fully present at every place all the time.

261
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,000
 Now I know you can't understand that, nor can I,

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,360
 but then again, we're not God.

263
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,640
 I mean, to be honest, just as mentioned,

264
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,520
 I'm really looking forward to my extended vacation

265
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,640
 in the UK next month, COVID willing.

266
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,240
 I'm going to see my elderly relatives.

267
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,240
 I've got four elderly relatives between the ages of 86 and 91.

268
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,120
 And in fact, my brother-in-law,

269
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,320
 will be celebrating his 92nd birthday while we're there.

270
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,280
 Now, I just wanna say to you guys,

271
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,560
 don't bother contacting me.

272
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,040
 I'm checked out.

273
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,480
 WhatsApp groups, gone.

274
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,760
 But think about it.

275
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,400
 If God went on vacation, even for a moment,

276
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,520
 the universe would fall apart.

277
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,760
 Now we don't have to worry about Him going on vacation

278
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,680
 because there's nowhere He could go

279
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,360
 because He's already there.

280
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,720
 It's like me saying, I think I wanna go on vacation.

281
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,400
 I think I wanna take Sandra special, somewhere special.

282
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,920
 So I'm gonna take her to Hong Kong.

283
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,240
 And then I realised I'm already here.

284
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,800
 Come to think of it,

285
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
 that's the story of the past two years, isn't it really?

286
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 But because God is a spirit, He can be everywhere at once.

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,320
 He couldn't possibly get any closer to you

288
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
 because He's everywhere.

289
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,200
 For centuries, people have asked, where's God?

290
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,200
 It's a very important question.

291
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,480
 Seekers want to know the answer

292
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,040
 because they want to find God,

293
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,120
 as if He's the one that's lost.

294
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,080
 A person who is carrying around a lot of guilt

295
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 wants to know where God is so they can run the other way.

296
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,440
 The hurting person, the lonely person wants to know

297
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,040
 because he or she feels abandoned by God.

298
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,040
 Where is God when I need Him?

299
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,520
 When I feel so alone

300
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,760
 and we see so much of this in the book of Psalms.

301
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,600
 As King David discovered,

302
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,080
 if I know that God is always with me,

303
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:19,080
 then I can depend on Him no matter what trouble I'm facing.

304
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,960
 No matter how bad things look,

305
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,160
 I know He's right here with me.

306
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
 Psalm 34, 18 says,

307
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,160
 "The Lord is near to those who are discouraged."

308
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,280
 Some of you might need to hear that today.

309
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,400
 He saves those who have lost all hope.

310
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,720
 My friends, if you're discouraged, God is with you.

311
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,200
 Is your heart breaking?

312
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,480
 God is near you.

313
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,680
 Are you lonely?

314
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,560
 You are not alone.

315
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,520
 God is with you.

316
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,200
 Do you feel like you don't know which way to go?

317
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,780
 God is your direction indicator, your road sign.

318
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,520
 In verse 10, He says this,

319
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,240
 "Your hand will guide me.

320
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,840
 "Your right hand will hold me fast."

321
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,680
 If you realise that God is with you,

322
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,320
 you realise you have nothing to worry about.

323
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,080
 He will guide you and He will hold you fast.

324
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,360
 You can trust Him no matter what comes along.

325
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,200
 The next section of Psalm 139

326
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,080
 is one of the best known parts of the Bible.

327
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,040
 This is why I really love this Psalm.

328
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,600
 We've seen, haven't we, that God sees everything about me.

329
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,800
 We've seen that God is continually with me.

330
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,640
 And in this section,

331
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,640
 we see that God planned out everything about me.

332
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,840
 I love this.

333
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,640
 Verse 13, "You created my inmost being.

334
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,240
 "You knit me together in my mother's womb.

335
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,720
 "I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

336
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,860
 "Your works are wonderful.

337
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,640
 "I know that full well.

338
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,960
 "My frame was not hidden from you

339
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,120
 "when I was made in the secret place,

340
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,960
 "when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.

341
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,360
 "Your eyes saw my unformed body.

342
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,200
 "All the days ordained for me were written in your book

343
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,880
 "before one of them came to be."

344
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,280
 You know, in 21st century,

345
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,280
 we put an incredible amount of importance on how we look.

346
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,960
 If I look good, I must be good.

347
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,480
 Wrong.

348
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,640
 It's amazing what we do to make ourselves look good.

349
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,320
 Slimming treatments, liposuction, facial scrubs.

350
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,000
 There's half of us over here on sunbeds

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,280
 getting fake sun tans,

352
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,360
 and the other half over there having face whitening.

353
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,480
 It's ridiculous.

354
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,600
 Proverbs 31 says, "Charm can be deceptive

355
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,400
 "and beauty doesn't last."

356
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,920
 My friends, no matter how much Botox you use,

357
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,900
 beauty doesn't last.

358
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,800
 1 Samuel 17 says, "Man looks at the outward appearance,

359
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,920
 "but God looks at the heart."

360
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 I need to tell you, God places no emphasis on how we look.

361
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,600
 He says it doesn't matter

362
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,200
 because you can't judge a person by his appearance.

363
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,160
 And here's the point, it's important.

364
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,840
 You need to listen to this.

365
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,200
 God created you exactly the way you are.

366
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,960
 I think I might say that again, it's so important.

367
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,480
 God created you exactly the way you are.

368
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,400
 It was part of his perfect plan for you.

369
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,240
 He wanted you to look just like you look.

370
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,960
 He wanted you to have exactly the skills

371
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,560
 and abilities and talents you have.

372
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,580
 That was his perfect design for you.

373
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,920
 In verse 13, David said, "You created my inmost being.

374
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,800
 "You knit me together in my mother's womb.

375
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,480
 "I praise you because I'm fearfully and wonderfully made.

376
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,520
 "Your works are wonderful."

377
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,120
 Can I be honest?

378
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,800
 Not many of us are really that excited

379
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,200
 about the way God made us.

380
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,420
 Many of us are so self-critical.

381
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,000
 We're always putting ourselves down.

382
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,740
 Oh, maybe you don't say it out loud,

383
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,720
 but you walk in here and you walk in here smiling.

384
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,880
 Hi.

385
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,800
 But inside you're thinking, I'm fat, I'm dumb,

386
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,440
 I'm ugly, I'm slow, I'm a bad person.

387
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,060
 I'm a terrible Christian.

388
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:32,960
 God wants you to stop putting yourself down.

389
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,800
 God wants you to stop putting yourself down.

390
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,880
 When you say these things,

391
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,460
 you're really pointing to the creator who made you.

392
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,720
 When you say, God, I'm worthless, I'm no good,

393
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,200
 I can't do anything.

394
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,560
 What you're really saying is,

395
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,200
 God, you blew it when you made me.

396
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,080
 God says, no, I didn't.

397
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,600
 God says, I created you just the way I wanted you,

398
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,080
 but you haven't figured out yet just how much I love you

399
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,700
 and what my purpose for you is.

400
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,300
 My friends, you are a marvellous creation

401
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,420
 and you are designed exactly the way He wanted you.

402
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,640
 Not only did God make you a wonderful creation,

403
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
 but He has a plan for your life.

404
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,700
 The verses we read earlier said that,

405
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,860
 even in my mother's womb, you were preparing me.

406
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,380
 You knit me together in my mother's womb.

407
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,000
 All the days ordained for me were written in your book

408
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,960
 before one of them came to be.

409
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,780
 God has a purpose for every person.

410
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:04,720
 And that means that you are on a special assignment

411
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,560
 from God.

412
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,620
 God's got some work to do in this world

413
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,180
 and it can only be done by you.

414
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,180
 When you understand that, it makes all the difference.

415
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,300
 So God sees everything about me.

416
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,220
 God is continually with me.

417
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,900
 God has planned everything about me.

418
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,880
 And let's go to the last section of the Psalm.

419
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,460
 We see that God is continually leading me.

420
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,420
 Verse 17, "How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!

421
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,300
 How vast is the sum of them!

422
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,220
 Were I to count them,

423
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,100
 they would outnumber the grains of sand.

424
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,420
 When I awake, I'm still with you.

425
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,820
 If only you would slay the wicked, O God,

426
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,500
 away with me, you bloodthirsty man.

427
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,280
 They speak of you with evil intent.

428
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,600
 Your adversaries misuse your name.

429
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,540
 Do I not hate those who hate you, O Lord,

430
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,380
 and abhor those who rise up against you?

431
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,820
 I have nothing but hatred for them.

432
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,420
 I count them my enemies.

433
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,420
 Search me, O God, and know my heart.

434
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,700
 Test me and know my anxious thoughts.

435
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,660
 See if there is any offensive way in me

436
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,700
 and lead me in the way everlasting."

437
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,540
 It says here that God's thoughts about you

438
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,580
 outnumber the number of grains of sand.

439
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,900
 Do you know how many grains of sand there are?

440
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,700
 Well, you will now, 'cause I'm gonna tell you.

441
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,700
 7.5 times 10 to the power of 18 grains of sand

442
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,900
 or 7 quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand.

443
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,940
 That's a lot of sandcastles.

444
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:01,020
 What that means is that God is thinking

445
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,220
 about you all the time.

446
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,180
 But what is he thinking?

447
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:14,420
 One of the things he's thinking about is in verse 23.

448
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,560
 Search me, O God, and know my heart.

449
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,620
 Test me and know my anxious thoughts.

450
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,260
 This sermon is called "Search Me."

451
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,420
 It says he is searching your heart.

452
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,220
 He's searching your motives,

453
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,860
 your anxious thoughts or worries,

454
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,860
 and leading you in the right direction.

455
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,240
 He's constantly thinking about me

456
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,480
 so he can constantly lead me

457
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,820
 so that I can follow him and be blessed.

458
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,620
 You see, God's not like my headmaster at school on that day.

459
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,060
 Every time I do the right thing, God's watching.

460
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,300
 Every time instead of sinning, I choose not to sin.

461
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,860
 Every time I resist the temptation,

462
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,540
 every time I stand up for the right thing,

463
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,580
 no matter how small or insignificant,

464
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,500
 God knows it and sees my faithfulness to him.

465
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,180
 Matthew 6, Jesus says,

466
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,240
 "Be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men.

467
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,000
 To be seen by them.

468
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,920
 Then your father who sees what is done in secret

469
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,320
 will reward you."

470
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,560
 Every good deed will be rewarded

471
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,320
 no matter how insignificant,

472
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,260
 regardless of whether anybody on earth even saw it.

473
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,560
 Every word of encouragement you give to other people,

474
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,320
 every kind word or compliment,

475
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,480
 every time you do a thoughtful act,

476
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,320
 every time you encourage someone, a community group,

477
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,760
 every time you had the opportunity to gossip and didn't,

478
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,400
 every time you had the opportunity to be critical

479
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,820
 and you weren't, God sees it all.

480
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,280
 He's omniscient.

481
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,720
 He's omnipresent.

482
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
 He's omnipotent.

483
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,880
 I'm glad they told me that at school.

484
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 You see,

485
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:42,300
 it ultimately doesn't matter how I appear to any of you

486
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,780
 or what anyone else thinks about me.

487
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,580
 This Psalm shows me the only thing that matters

488
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,340
 is what God thinks of me.

489
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,200
 And I've already told you

490
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,740
 that he is omnibenevolent, all good.

491
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,520
 So how I'm gonna finish

492
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,760
 is I'm gonna tell you exactly what God thinks about you.

493
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,560
 I'm gonna read to you something

494
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,040
 that's called the Father's Love Letter.

495
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,640
 Some of you may have seen it.

496
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,560
 It's taken mainly from Psalm 139

497
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,760
 and elsewhere in scriptures.

498
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,200
 And what I'm gonna ask you to do now

499
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,540
 is to close your eyes.

500
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,340
 Just take all the distractions away,

501
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,040
 put your phone down for a moment.

502
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,940
 This is God talking to you.

503
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,280
 My child,

504
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,200
 notice before we start what he's called you.

505
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
 My child, my son, my daughter.

506
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,420
 You may not know me, but I know everything about you.

507
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,480
 I know when you sit down and when you rise up,

508
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,580
 I am familiar with all your ways.

509
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,480
 Even the very hairs on your head are numbered.

510
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,920
 For you were made in my image.

511
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,840
 In me you live and move and have your being,

512
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,260
 for you are my offspring.

513
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:18,920
 I knew you even before you were conceived.

514
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,840
 I chose you when I planned creation.

515
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,200
 You are not a mistake,

516
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,080
 for all your days are written in my book.

517
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,700
 I determined the exact time of your birth

518
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,960
 and where you would live.

519
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,560
 You are fearfully and wonderfully made.

520
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,760
 I knit you together in your mother's womb

521
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,240
 and brought you forth on the day you were born.

522
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,740
 Now I've been misrepresented by those who don't know me.

523
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,880
 I'm not distant and angry,

524
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,760
 but I'm the complete expression of love.

525
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,000
 And it's my desire to lavish my love on you,

526
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 simply because you are my child and I am your father.

527
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,240
 I offer you more than your earthly father ever could,

528
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,400
 for I am the perfect father.

529
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,400
 Every good gift that you receive comes from my hand,

530
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 for I am your provider and I meet all your needs.

531
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,040
 My plan for your future has always been filled with hope,

532
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,800
 because I love you with an everlasting love.

533
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,440
 My thoughts towards you are as countless

534
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,960
 as the sand on the seashore.

535
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,840
 And I rejoice over you with singing.

536
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,080
 I will never stop doing good to you,

537
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,480
 for you are my treasured possession.

538
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,480
 I desire to establish you with all my heart and soul.

539
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,460
 And I want to show you great and marvellous things.

540
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,820
 If you will seek me with all your heart, you will find me.

541
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,540
 Delight in me and I will give you the desires of your heart,

542
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:04,040
 for it is I who gave you those desires.

543
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,520
 I'm able to do more for you than you could possibly imagine,

544
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,240
 for I am your greatest encourager.

545
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,040
 I'm also the father who comforts you in all your troubles.

546
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,360
 When you are brokenhearted, I'm close to you.

547
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,120
 As a shepherd carries a lamb,

548
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,720
 I've carried you close to my heart.

549
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,440
 One day I will wipe away every tear from your eyes

550
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,200
 and I'll take away all the pain

551
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
 you've suffered on this earth.

552
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,960
 I am your father and I love you,

553
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,300
 even as I love my son, Jesus.

554
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,940
 For in Jesus, my love for you is revealed.

555
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,460
 He is the exact representation of my being.

556
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,660
 He came to demonstrate that I am for you

557
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,140
 and not against you.

558
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,860
 And to tell you I'm not counting your sins.

559
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,660
 Jesus died so that you and I could be reconciled.

560
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,060
 His death was the ultimate expression of my love for you.

561
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,060
 I gave up everything I loved that I might gain your love.

562
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,020
 If you receive the gift of my son, Jesus,

563
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,380
 you receive me and nothing will ever separate you

564
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,140
 from my love again.

565
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,620
 Come home and I'll throw the biggest party

566
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,780
 heaven has ever seen.

567
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,780
 I've always been father and will always be father.

568
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,580
 My question is, will you be my child?

569
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,940
 I am waiting for you.

570
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:46,260
 And it's signed, love your dad, almighty God.

571
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260
 Almighty God.
