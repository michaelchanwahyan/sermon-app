1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 I also want to take this opportunity just to wish all you moms a happy Mother's Day

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,360
 and I hope everyone here knows they're loved and we're so blessed to have you and we're

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,360
 just grateful for you.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:26,120
 Now today we're in the final sermon of our sermon series, resurrection.

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,160
 Everything was bothering Justin apparently.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,960
 We're in the final sermon of our sermon series, resurrection hope.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,520
 I hope you've been enjoying that because a lot of times what happens is when you have

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,560
 Easter, you talk about resurrection and Jesus rose and then you move on and a lot of times

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,480
 you don't talk about much more.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,880
 We actually wanted to unpack practically what that means for our lives.

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,040
 That's where I want to pick up today and continue.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,080
 To start things off, I want to share something from my teenage years a little while ago.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:06,680
 I was I think around 15 years, 14 years old and a friend of mine and I, we decided to

14
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,920
 go on a skiing trip.

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,160
 This was a skiing trip that was organized by a local or actually our state skiing association.

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,480
 We met all these other youth in Frankfurt and then we drove to Switzerland.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,360
 I don't even remember where we went.

18
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
 We drove all the way there.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
 We got there.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,840
 We step into a youth hostel and that's one of those things where you don't have a million

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
 beds in one room.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,400
 There was like eight beds or so in one room.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,000
 My friend, he starts to unpack everything.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,160
 He starts hanging up all his clothes, putting all his socks there, his towel, his pants.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,600
 We had to bring our own bed sheet and bed covers.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,120
 He did all of that stuff.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,240
 Then he went and left the room, went to the bathroom.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:01,600
 Just when he left, one of the older youth in the room said, "Hey, let's repack his bag."

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,080
 And so he egged everyone on to do it.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:15,040
 They started repacking his bag, packed it all up, which he had just nicely unpacked.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,800
 The message that they were sending was clear, "Go back home."

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,040
 He was the easy one to pick on in that room by the older guy.

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,280
 I have to say to my shame, while I didn't participate in putting the stuff in the suitcase,

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
 I actually did not stand up for my friend.

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,120
 It's really bothered me.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,600
 I don't know if you've ever experienced that, where you miss this opportunity to be the

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,440
 person that you want to be.

38
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,040
 I was lacking the courage to just at least try them to stop from doing what they were

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 doing.

40
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,520
 I just carried this deep disappointment in myself and shame.

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:04,840
 I think we all, at one point or another, lack the courage that we wish we would have.

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,120
 Where there's these moments in our lives where we want to have courage, but for whatever

43
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,640
 reason, there can be many reasons.

44
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,720
 We just cannot find the courage to be who we're meant to be.

45
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,040
 We cannot find the courage to do what we're meant to do.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,020
 This might look like things, maybe there's a conversation that we just need to have.

47
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,480
 It just needs to be addressed.

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,760
 It's been looming, but we just are not able to have that conversation.

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,800
 We lack the courage.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:45,040
 Maybe God is asking us to do something new in our lives, but for so long, we've been

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,920
 doing what we know is wrong.

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,040
 We just lack the courage to change and become a different type of person.

53
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,960
 Maybe it has to do with there's this job shift that you perhaps sense the Holy Spirit leading

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
 you to take.

55
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,440
 Maybe it's a totally different career.

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,880
 It's not the thing you've been doing before, but you lack the courage to make that shift,

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,520
 to take that step because there's so many unknowns.

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:22,560
 Maybe you need courage for a situation where your life is in shambles.

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,320
 Stuff hasn't been working out, and you just find yourself in this heap and this rubble

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,600
 of your life.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,280
 You lack the courage and the ability to move forward and to start afresh or to start new.

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,480
 You just don't know what to do.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,120
 Or putting it maybe more positively, maybe there's a coworker where they really need

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,000
 prayer and you have the opportunity to actually pray for them, but you lack the courage to

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,760
 ask them, "Hey, would it be okay if I pray for you?

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,480
 I know you don't believe in Jesus, but I think this really would help you."

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,800
 So you can see there's all these different areas in the ones that you know from your

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:12,840
 own life where we can use courage to be the people that God has created us to be, that

69
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,040
 God has called us to be, and to do what honors him and what is good and what is right and

70
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,760
 what is just.

71
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,040
 But for whatever reason, there can be many reasons we struggle to find that courage.

72
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,000
 So what I want to explore with you today in this message is this question, where do we

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 find the courage that we lack?

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,720
 Where do you get that courage from?

75
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,600
 Where can you find that?

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,080
 How can we close that gap from who we are and who we want to be or who we need to be?

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,160
 How do you close that gap?

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,600
 And so I want to explore that with you through the topic of resurrection.

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,920
 I want to explore that with you from a passage of the Apostle Paul in his letter to the first

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,120
 Corinthians.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,560
 So let me set with you the context a little bit for this letter that Paul wrote before

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,600
 we go into the specific passage.

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,360
 So Paul, he planted the church in Corinth.

84
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
 So he started it.

85
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,800
 He was there for, I think, roughly two years.

86
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,640
 Then he moved on to plant other churches.

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
 It's the thing that Paul did.

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,360
 He planted churches.

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 So at some point in time, he hears about that there is the vision in the church.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
 There's conflict.

91
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
 There's disagreements.

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,360
 You know, and of course, that must have broken his heart.

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,200
 And then a group of people come and they share with him a letter of questions where there's

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,240
 just all these issues where they're trying to figure out how are we supposed to think

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
 about this?

96
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,040
 We don't know what to do.

97
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,600
 And so Paul then authors the letter of first Corinthians to address all these, the division,

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,680
 to address all these issues.

99
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,200
 And really what he gets at, and I find this absolutely fascinating, is it's helping the

100
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,640
 Corinthian believers think through what the gospel is and what it means to line their

101
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,860
 lives with the gospel.

102
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,560
 And you can see this even in the structure of his letter, because in chapter one and

103
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,880
 two, Paul talks about the cross, Jesus's death.

104
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,720
 And then in chapter 15, which is, there's still one chapter, but the chapter 16 is like

105
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,160
 the postscript of the letter.

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,520
 He talks about the resurrection.

107
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,880
 So everything in the letter is between the cross and the resurrection, which is the central

108
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,000
 part of the gospel message.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,080
 And so we're going to look at chapter 15.

110
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,840
 It's the longest chapter on the resurrection or the most prolonged argument and discussion

111
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,040
 on that topic in the Bible, chapter 15, first Corinthians.

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,960
 I'm going to take you there in a moment, but I'm just going to say this.

113
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,200
 Today it's going to take me a little bit of time to get around to why, how does this relate

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 to courage?

115
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,840
 Okay, so just stick with me.

116
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
 All right.

117
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
 Sounds good.

118
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
 Thank you.

119
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
 All right.

120
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,400
 So we are in first Corinthians chapter 15, verse 12, starting there.

121
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,040
 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you

122
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,740
 say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

123
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,420
 And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.

124
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:34,160
 So the problem that apostle Paul is addressing here is that some are denying the resurrection

125
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,960
 of the dead.

126
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,880
 Now they believe the basic gospel proclamation that Christ died on the cross, that he was

127
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,400
 buried and that he rose.

128
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,280
 Now they affirm that, but they're saying, but I don't believe in the resurrection of

129
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
 the dead.

130
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,400
 And what they're failing to see is that Jesus's resurrection and the resurrection of the dead,

131
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,840
 they belong together.

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,820
 You cannot separate them.

133
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,780
 And so they're undermining the basic message of the gospel.

134
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,120
 And Paul wants them to see that and help them think through how that impacts all of their

135
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,180
 lives and what they do.

136
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:22,000
 And so when the gospel message isn't clear to us, it weakens our faith, hope, and courage.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,440
 I guess I did tie it in here.

138
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,840
 Because we don't truly understand the foundation that supports them and what they're based

139
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,660
 on.

140
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,520
 So if we want to be people of courage, we need to understand the gospel message and

141
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,200
 what that implies for us.

142
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,560
 But a lot of times if we're honest, there's a lot of fuzziness around a lot of things

143
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,080
 that we believe.

144
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,600
 And if we're fuzzy, then it's hard to have that confidence and that clarity.

145
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,540
 And so today part of my heart is just to also bring some clarity to what the ground is on

146
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,800
 which we stand, in which we can have hope, faith, courage, love, all of those things.

147
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,960
 But let's continue in verse 14.

148
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,280
 So here Paul, he unpacks the problem of if you were not to believe in the resurrection

149
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,920
 of the dead and by implication the resurrection of Jesus, this is what you're left with.

150
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,920
 And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,400
 Ouch.

152
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,800
 More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God for we have testified

153
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,360
 about God that he raised Christ from the dead, but he did not raise him.

154
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,420
 In fact, the dead are not raised.

155
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,140
 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.

156
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,240
 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile.

157
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,100
 You are still in your sins.

158
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,000
 Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,200
 If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.

160
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
 Wow.

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,240
 So he's really unpacking the consequences of not affirming the resurrection of Jesus

162
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,340
 and the resurrection of the dead.

163
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,420
 So if Christ has not been raised, so I have a summary here.

164
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,760
 Christian faith is futile.

165
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
 It's empty.

166
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
 It's meaningless.

167
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 We are unforgiven and left in our sins.

168
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,400
 Those who have died in Christian hope, they've died on a false hope.

169
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
 They're lost.

170
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:36,800
 Those who currently hope in Christ are most to be pitied because their hope is fake.

171
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,160
 So in other words, Christianity without Christ's resurrection doesn't make any sense.

172
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,920
 Christianity without the resurrection of the dead doesn't make any sense.

173
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
 You know, it belongs together.

174
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,080
 We cannot separate that.

175
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,080
 But if Christ has been raised, all those negatives, they turn into positives.

176
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
 So I have those as well.

177
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
 Our faith counts.

178
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,120
 Our sins are forgiven.

179
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,700
 Those who died believing Jesus, they will be raised.

180
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,980
 And those who currently hope and trust in Christ are to be envied since God's power

181
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:18,920
 is at work in them and they have hope now, but also beyond death.

182
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,520
 So the point that Paul is making is that the resurrection of Christ isn't just one belief

183
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,800
 among many that you can kind of like, "Oh, you know, it doesn't matter what I believe

184
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 on this."

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,880
 No, it matters.

186
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,000
 It's not just one belief among many.

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,160
 It's the very thing that gives meaning and power to everything else that we believe.

188
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,840
 And to be fuzzy about that or to have the wrong understanding or to affirm that, it's

189
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,480
 like cutting the legs from underneath our faith.

190
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
 Everything collapses.

191
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:59,640
 And so Paul is addressing this misunderstanding and he's explaining that the basics of the

192
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,560
 gospel message on which the ground in which we can have new life in Christ, the ground

193
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,760
 on which our sins are forgiven, the ground on which we can have hope, the ground on which

194
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:19,880
 we have faith, the ground, yes, on which we can have courage to live the life that Jesus

195
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,900
 calls us to live, has created us to live.

196
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:36,080
 And so Jesus' bodily resurrection gives us hope and it shows us also something very significant.

197
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,040
 Like during that time, there was a negative view regarding the material world, that it

198
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,840
 was corrupt.

199
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,400
 And the way salvation was understood in a Greco-Roman world was that the soul was meant

200
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,320
 to escape the body.

201
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,720
 So when Christianity affirms the material world, yes, it's corrupted by sin, but God

202
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,560
 will redeem the corrupted creation from sin.

203
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:10,880
 So when Jesus' body is raised, it shows that God is also affirming his good creation.

204
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,040
 Because in the Hebrew mindset, creation in the material world is good.

205
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,000
 Yes, it's impacted by sin, but it's good.

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,560
 And God one day will renew, restore all things, all of creation.

207
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,400
 And so Paul, he put it differently.

208
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,440
 What Paul wanted the Corinthians to understand is this, Jesus' resurrection was not simply

209
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,800
 God's miraculous intervention that rescued him from death.

210
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,320
 So it was not just something for Jesus and for nobody else, but it was the beginning

211
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,840
 of God's renewal of all things.

212
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,040
 It's like the turning point, everything starts changing.

213
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,280
 Resurrection is a central piece of God's redemptive and restorative work for all of his creation.

214
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,760
 And so it really is that turning point where you have, when you look at the biblical grand

215
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,560
 narrative, you have the fall, well, you have creation, then you have the fall into sin,

216
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,280
 then you have the story of redemption.

217
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:20,480
 And it culminates in Jesus dying and rising, and then also in Jesus coming again.

218
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,960
 So this is the turning point.

219
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,920
 And it doesn't just have implications for Jesus, but for everyone else, for this world,

220
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
 for us.

221
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,280
 And so Paul is saying, you cannot separate us.

222
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,440
 This belongs together as part of the same gospel story, good news message.

223
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,200
 But let's continue because Paul does affirm that Christ rose.

224
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,440
 So in verse 20, it says this, "But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the

225
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,200
 first fruits of those who have fallen asleep."

226
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,720
 So talking about those who were dead.

227
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,760
 "For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.

228
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,520
 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."

229
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,400
 Now if you're like, this sounds familiar, it should because Pastor Chapman preached

230
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,200
 about it two weeks ago, this passage here.

231
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,440
 But I'm going to highlight something from a little bit of a different angle.

232
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,200
 The first thing is, I mean, the first fruits, so Pastor Chapman talked about that, I'll

233
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,320
 repeat that briefly.

234
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,400
 So first fruits is the first fruits of a harvest, like the first apple that's ripe, the first

235
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,780
 wheat that's ripe.

236
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:37,080
 And Paul compares the resurrection to first fruits, which means there's more to follow.

237
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,360
 Just like in a harvest, you know, after the first fruits there's more to follow, with

238
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,200
 Christ's resurrection there is more to follow.

239
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,840
 Because it's just the beginning of something new that God has inaugurated, that he has

240
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
 begun.

241
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:58,920
 And what's going to follow is the renewal of all things, including the resurrection

242
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,560
 of the dead.

243
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,640
 But then the second thing is, and this he shifts the metaphor, he talks about being

244
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,280
 in Adam and being in Christ.

245
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,320
 And we, all of us, either we participate with a life in Adam or we participate in a life

246
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 of Christ.

247
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,240
 And so there's no in between room.

248
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:23,400
 And Adam means we're under sin, we're under the fall, you know, and we will need to deal

249
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
 with the consequence.

250
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:34,720
 But if we are in Christ, that means we have been raised from death to new life in Christ.

251
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,800
 And so we now get to participate in this new life that Christ has brought.

252
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,600
 And you know, our story has changed.

253
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,240
 We're not no longer living the story of Adam, we're living now the story of Christ.

254
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,760
 And I know I noticed this a little bit abstract, I'm going to get to the practical.

255
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,800
 But one thing I want to highlight here is at the end of verse 22, it talks about the

256
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,960
 future reality of the resurrection.

257
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,140
 Because it talks about that those who are in Christ will be made alive, future.

258
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,640
 But that's not the only way the Bible talks about the resurrection, because it also talks

259
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,140
 about the present reality of the resurrection.

260
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,040
 And so does Paul, where he talks about us being made alive in Christ now.

261
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,600
 So I want to read a passage from you from Ephesians 2, verse 4.

262
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,520
 It says, "But because of this great love for us, God was rich in mercy, made us alive

263
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,840
 with Christ, even when we were dead in our transgressions.

264
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,920
 It is by grace you have been saved, and God raised us up with Christ and seated us with

265
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,680
 him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus."

266
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,560
 So here it's the present reality.

267
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,960
 We were made alive for Christ.

268
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,400
 We were dead in our sins.

269
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,240
 Ephesians, before Paul came, proclaimed the gospel, they were dead in their sins.

270
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,780
 They were under Adam.

271
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,160
 But because they believed, they repented of their sins and they placed their faith in

272
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,880
 Jesus, they were made alive with Christ.

273
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,880
 Present reality, God's power at work, raising believers to new life, bringing transformation,

274
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,280
 bringing change, giving the gift of his Holy Spirit.

275
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,840
 Every believer is filled with the Spirit and receives the gift of the Holy Spirit.

276
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,760
 And so now we're on a different trajectory.

277
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,520
 We can live differently.

278
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,960
 And so that's really what I want to focus with you on today, is the present reality

279
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,400
 of the resurrection and how that impacts our life.

280
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,000
 You know, the power of God here and now that raised Jesus from the dead is the same power

281
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 that is at work in your life if you believe in him.

282
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,080
 So you have that same power at work, not just when you become a Christian, but as you continue

283
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,800
 to live the life of following Jesus.

284
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,400
 Well, let's continue.

285
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,240
 So Paul, he, and this is the final section we're going to look at in this letter, he

286
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,600
 draws out two more, he gives two examples of two practices that the Corinthians practiced

287
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,640
 that do not make sense if you don't believe that Jesus rose.

288
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,240
 Like it just would not make sense.

289
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,520
 And so we're going to look at the second one.

290
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,600
 I think that's the easier one to understand.

291
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,240
 It's from Paul's own life, his own ministry.

292
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,360
 And it stands under the heading that now if there is no resurrection, so let's pick it

293
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,800
 up in verse 30.

294
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:55,520
 And as for us, now if there is no resurrection, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?

295
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,280
 I face death every day.

296
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,960
 Yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

297
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,340
 If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained?

298
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,040
 If the dead are not raised, let us eat, drink, for tomorrow we die.

299
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,640
 He's actually quoting a philosopher from the time.

300
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:28,400
 So Paul is saying like, if Christ has not been raised, then me and my coworkers risking

301
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,600
 our lives, it doesn't make any sense.

302
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 Why would we do that?

303
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,480
 That's just stupid.

304
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,400
 Moreover, he says in verse 31, I face death every day.

305
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,880
 Now a more literal translation of this there, I die daily.

306
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,280
 So it's actually in reference to Jesus, his self-giving love.

307
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,080
 So I'm living this death to self to serve other people, to build other people up, to

308
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,880
 bring them the flourishing, to bring them the faith.

309
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:05,200
 And if I do this every day, but Jesus didn't rise, it doesn't make any sense.

310
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
 Because why would you do that?

311
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,840
 Then let's just all have a party and just seize the day, carpe diem, enjoy this life

312
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
 and that's it.

313
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,520
 Drink, eat, be merry.

314
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:26,700
 But that is not the case because Paul affirms that Christ did rise.

315
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:35,600
 And so I want to bring us back to the question that we asked at the beginning of the message.

316
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,720
 Where do we find courage?

317
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,760
 Where do we find the courage that we lack?

318
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,960
 We find it because Jesus died and rose and because that shifts our perspective on how

319
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,420
 we live now.

320
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:59,640
 It shifts our perspective even beyond death and God by his spirit, by his Holy Spirit

321
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,880
 can empower us to have courage and to live lives that we could not live out of our own

322
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 strength.

323
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,480
 I want to give two examples of how we can experience the present reality of the resurrection

324
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,320
 of Jesus in our lives now.

325
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,680
 Now that can help us live the courageous lives and be the courageous people that God has

326
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,060
 created us to be.

327
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,000
 The first one is this, we can find courage for our lives in a personal relationship with

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,760
 Jesus.

329
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,160
 That really is the starting point.

330
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,920
 The power of sin when you repent of our faith and place our trust in him is broken.

331
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,620
 The Bible talks about that we crossed over from death to life.

332
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,860
 The Holy Spirit has given you new birth, new life.

333
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,700
 You are a new creation.

334
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,040
 Something has shifted, something has changed.

335
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,480
 What has separated you between you and God has been removed.

336
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,700
 You now have access to the Father.

337
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,160
 You are a child, a son, a daughter of God.

338
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,640
 You can live in that relationship and that intimacy with the Father, the Son, and the

339
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,160
 Holy Spirit.

340
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,880
 When we live in that relationship, now as Christians it doesn't mean that we're always

341
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,200
 are drawing close to God.

342
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,760
 We don't always live intimately in that relationship.

343
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,360
 But when we do that, when we draw close and we pray and we talk to God and we get to know

344
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,960
 God more through his word and we seek God together with other people and we just enjoy

345
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:47,200
 his presence, that brings so much assurance to our hearts, to our minds.

346
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:56,120
 I had this picture of if I as a little child would face some dangerous situation on my

347
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,580
 own, it's quite scary.

348
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,560
 But if my father stands right here and I'm facing the same situation, it's quite different,

349
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
 right?

350
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:14,560
 Because when we have a relationship with Jesus, when we are children of God, when we have

351
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,400
 a heavenly Father, we are not facing the circumstance alone.

352
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,560
 The Lord is with us.

353
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,720
 We can know his presence.

354
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,440
 And having his presence with us and operating from the ground of being in that relationship

355
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,320
 versus on our own can transform how we engage it.

356
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,840
 Because now we're not engaging it alone, we're engaging it with our heavenly Father.

357
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,720
 So it gives us that ground for courage.

358
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,640
 We're not facing the giants on our own.

359
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,640
 We're facing them with God who is so much bigger, so much more powerful, so much more

360
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,120
 mighty than whatever it is that we're facing.

361
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,240
 But we only know that when we dwell, when we live in that intimacy.

362
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:05,040
 As I was praying for us, it was a couple of days ago, I had this image and I was of a

363
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,120
 child, which I think makes sense.

364
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,480
 I'm a parent of a young child.

365
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,240
 So I think God speaks to us in ways that make sense to us, right?

366
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:20,160
 I had this image of a child and it was just crying, just tears and screaming.

367
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,320
 And it was running to the Father, into the Father's arms.

368
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,440
 It was anxious, it was unsettled.

369
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,160
 And I just really had to sense that some of us here today were living in that anxiousness

370
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,080
 and in that unsettledness.

371
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,640
 And we've been sitting in that.

372
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,840
 And that God is inviting us like a child to run into the Father's arms, to allow ourselves

373
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,080
 to be embraced by our heavenly Father.

374
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:57,080
 And that's in that relationship with our Father and by being embraced, that the fear, the

375
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:04,600
 anxiety, whatever is weighing on your heart, it melts away.

376
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,480
 So I just sensed that some of you are being invited to run into the Father's arms.

377
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:19,480
 You've been somewhere else and it's time to draw close and just sit in God's arms in

378
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:30,040
 his presence and to take away your anxieties, your worries, as you just settle in his love

379
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,960
 and who he is, because he loves you and he is with you.

380
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,000
 You are not alone.

381
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,240
 But we're so anxious and frantic, we just lose sight of that.

382
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:50,320
 So if that's you, I want to encourage you to do that, to run into the Father's arms.

383
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,880
 The second way that we can find the courage that we lack is to face our, we can face our

384
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:05,680
 challenge because God's power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in your life.

385
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,800
 When we become a Christian, we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

386
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,840
 Now, a lot of times we can operate out of our own strength and I think we all have that

387
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 tendency.

388
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,440
 We're going to try to solve this out of our own means, out of our own strength.

389
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,800
 And so many times you don't go and surrender to God and surrender to the work of the Holy

390
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,040
 Spirit in our lives.

391
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:38,080
 And when we try to do things out of our own strength, we can't find the courage within

392
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
 ourselves.

393
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,680
 On social media, they probably tell you, "Find courage inside yourself."

394
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,560
 But you're not going to find it inside yourself.

395
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,560
 You're going to find it in God.

396
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,880
 You're going to find it in the Holy Spirit.

397
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,920
 And I have this, one of my favorite authors, he recently passed away, philosopher, Dallas

398
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
 Willard.

399
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,440
 He tells a story in one of my favorite books, The Divine Conspiracy, and he writes this.

400
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,760
 I want to share this story with you.

401
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
 He says this.

402
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,040
 He recounts a story from his childhood.

403
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:12,520
 So as a child, I lived in an area of southern Missouri where electricity was available only

404
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,240
 in the form of lightning.

405
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:23,560
 But in my senior year of high school, the REA, Rural Electrification Administration,

406
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,400
 that's a mouthful right there, right, extended its lines into the area where we lived.

407
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,000
 And electrical power became available to households and farms.

408
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,520
 And when those lines came by our farm, a very different way of life presented itself.

409
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:51,280
 A relationship to fundamental aspects of life, daylight and dark, hot and cold, clean and

410
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,920
 dirty, work and leisure, preparing food and preserving it.

411
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,280
 You know, all of that changes with electricity.

412
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,920
 Because now you have a different power source that impacts all of those things.

413
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,800
 Like, you can have light, you can have electricity for a fridge, you can have electricity for

414
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,160
 power tools.

415
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,400
 And so electricity had the potential to change everything for the better.

416
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,920
 But we still had to believe in the electricity and its arrangements, understand them, and

417
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,960
 take the practical steps involved in relying on it.

418
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,740
 And he goes on to share that not every one of their neighbors took the step to be connected

419
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,360
 to the electrical grid.

420
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,000
 Not everyone did it.

421
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,040
 And becoming a follower of Jesus, becoming alive to God, it's like being connected to

422
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 the electrical grid.

423
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,360
 It's that you get the gift of the Spirit of God.

424
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,720
 You have the Spirit of God running through your body.

425
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,760
 But it doesn't mean that we're always relying on the work of the Spirit and are surrendered

426
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,880
 and submitted to the Spirit and asking God for strength.

427
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,360
 And so we need to, even as Christians, we need to connect ourselves to the source and

428
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:18,040
 allow the Spirit of God to give us the strength, the courage, the hope, the faith that we lack,

429
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:29,760
 and we do lack it, to deal with the challenges, the worries, the situations, so we can face

430
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,320
 them and have the grace and the strength to face them.

431
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,720
 Some of the challenges by the power of God who raised Jesus from the dead, that's that

432
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,800
 power that is at work in your life.

433
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,760
 God can remove obstacles in our life.

434
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,640
 He can do that if he wants to.

435
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,440
 Now sometimes they still remain.

436
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,080
 They don't just always go away.

437
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,880
 But what's different is that we now, no longer out of our own strength face the situation,

438
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,160
 but we face the situation by the power of God, the Spirit of God giving us the grace

439
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,200
 and the strength to face them.

440
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,880
 So I want to invite the worship team to come up right now.

441
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:25,560
 And I want to invite us to actually respond to what I shared, because for some of us we

442
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,640
 are sitting right now in anxiety.

443
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,560
 We are restless, and maybe there's even been tears even last night, maybe even this morning.

444
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:41,120
 Now it's just been a tear-filled week.

445
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,080
 And our Heavenly Father is inviting us to run into his arms, to sit and embrace our

446
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:56,920
 Heavenly Father, and to let our fears and our anxiety be melted away in his love.

447
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:04,640
 And to restore our peace, which is also the work of the Holy Spirit, to give us peace

448
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:12,960
 when there's chaos all around us, to restore joy where we lost joy.

449
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,600
 So that's the first way that I want to invite people to respond.

450
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:23,200
 The second way is this, that if you are facing a challenging situation where you need courage,

451
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,960
 if you have that conversation you need to have, if you are facing that decision, if

452
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,080
 you are missing opportunities you actually want to seize, I want to encourage both those

453
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,240
 running into the Father's arms and those needing that courage to just stretch out your hands

454
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,560
 before you.

455
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,760
 And so I want to invite you to do this right now, just as a sign of openness to God and

456
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,080
 longing for him to meet you and to receive from him.

457
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,840
 And what I want to ask us as a family, as a church family to do is actually to go to

458
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,240
 those that we see who have their arms stretched out and to just pray over them.

459
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,080
 You can ask them how to pray, you can just pray, just keep it simple.

460
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,280
 And we're going to take five or so minutes to do that and then I'll bring us back.

461
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,080
 So let's do this right now, let's pray for each other.

462
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,520
 Let's do this, church.

463
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,840
 So you can get up and if you see somebody with their hands stretched out just go and

464
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,360
 pray for them.

465
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,440
 (laughs)
