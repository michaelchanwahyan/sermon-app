[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   There is so much that I wonder about.
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.940]   The first thing I wonder about, if you were here at the beginning of the service,
[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.980]   Benedict talked about having a playlist that gets him pumped up for work, right?
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.940]   And so I'm like, "What is on that playlist?"
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.020]   So I'm wondering about it. You can ask him later.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.740]   And then with Jill's presentation, I was like,
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.560]   "I hope that the offering time is not going to be a mess."
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.820]   So everybody's going to do the offering in this way.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.940]   It's a lot of thoughts floating through my head.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.540]   But hey, I am excited to kick off this new sermon series today.
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.840]   When I was a young professional, 2001, I was working for Morgan Stanley,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.180]   and it was my second job out of university.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.480]   And I really wanted to connect my faith to my work.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.820]   In my first job, I didn't care about that that much,
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.660]   but in this job, I really wanted to do it.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.360]   I was in a different place spiritually.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.940]   And my work was a grind.
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.760]   I mean, it was not easy work. It was difficult work.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.860]   And I think a lot of you know a lot of our work is not easy, right?
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.100]   A lot of work is very difficult.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.300]   And so the ways that I came up with
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.260]   of how I can connect my faith with my work were three ways.
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.140]   The first one was that I needed to be ethical.
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.500]   Not everyone around me was ethical.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.140]   But I felt God asking me, and I think as Christians we should be, right?
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.340]   Should be ethical in how I conduct business.
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.180]   The second way that I thought of connecting my faith and work was
[00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.340]   I need to make a lot of money so I can be generous,
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.980]   so I can give to church, so I can give to NGOs,
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.260]   so I can give to missions, organizations.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.500]   And then the third way that I thought I could connect my faith with my work
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.180]   was sharing the gospel at work.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.380]   So those were the three ways that I came up with.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.420]   But I have to say, all of these things, they're great things.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.900]   They're wonderful things, and we should do them.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.740]   Do be ethical, right?
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.940]   Share the gospel, do all of that.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.300]   But I felt like there must be more.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.100]   There has to be a greater way of integrating my faith and my work.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.060]   But what is it?
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.700]   And so a friend of mine, he knew a pastor.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.300]   I didn't know the pastor, and he connected me with him.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.900]   So I met up with the pastor, talked to him about what was going on,
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.300]   because I actually was having a little bit of a spiritual crisis around this.
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.020]   And then I walked away from the meeting
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.060]   with the message that in order to connect my faith and my work,
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.300]   I needed to do something additional.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.980]   So it was my work plus something else.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.540]   And that plus something else was running a stewardship seminar
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.980]   on finances with biblical principles.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.100]   And so the implicit message was that my work on its own
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.140]   did not connect with my faith.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.900]   Now, he didn't say that, and I don't think he ever would have said that,
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.060]   but that was the message that I got.
[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.500]   And so he actually was even very helpful.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.380]   He even connected me with a men's group where I could run finance seminars
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.860]   and do things like that.
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.820]   But again, deep down in my heart,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:23.900]   I was like, "There has to be a way of integrating my faith with my work."
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.540]   After all, we spend so much time at work that it just has to be more.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.300]   But what is it?
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.900]   And I didn't know.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.740]   And perhaps some of you find yourself in that same place
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.260]   where you are experiencing that same disconnection in your work
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.500]   that you're doing right now,
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.140]   where you wonder, "How in the world does this connect with my faith?"
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.580]   Is there anything more besides me sharing the gospel
[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.940]   and doing something extra in addition to what I'm already doing
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.620]   to connect my faith and my work?
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.540]   And so what I want to do with you in this message,
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.940]   I want to explore with you a question.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.220]   The question is this.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:16.340]   Does God have a greater purpose for work than most of us have ever imagined?
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.460]   So that's what we're going to look at.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.980]   I'm really excited about this.
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.140]   Today, we are also kicking off this new sermon series
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.860]   which we have entitled "Stewarding Our Lives."
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.140]   And so in this sermon series,
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.260]   we are going to explore things around work, rest,
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.180]   and we're going to look at God's Word,
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.620]   what God's Word has to say to us.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.380]   Because a lot of times, what shapes our view
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.220]   is actually our surrounding culture and not Scripture
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.620]   about how we think about these things.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.660]   So I want to give you a little bit of an overview.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.780]   So let's have a look at this.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.980]   So the first topic today, we're going to talk about cultivating,
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.180]   and we'll get to what that means.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.820]   Next week, Pastor Chapman, he's going to talk about thorns and thistles.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.820]   Whatever. Good that I'm not preaching that message.
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.620]   (Laughter)
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.220]   All right. Thistles. There you go.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.820]   Yes.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.060]   Which has to do with that sin does impact our work.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.380]   There's frustration, there's fruitlessness,
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.020]   and so he'll unpack that.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.020]   Then we're going to talk about calling.
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.940]   You know what God's calling, what is His purpose,
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.620]   how do we know that, how do we discern that,
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.580]   or do we even need to discern that?
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.980]   So we're going to explore that question,
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.980]   and then I'm really excited,
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.660]   we have the executive director of Branches of Hope,
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.340]   and he is going to be sharing, Alex, my German brother,
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:50.060]   and he is going to be sharing about work as having a restorative presence.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.180]   Wherever we are, so excited about that,
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.300]   and he'll be doing that in the Cantonese and the English service.
[00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.180]   And then we're going to talk about rest,
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.220]   because life is not just about work,
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.860]   it's also about enjoying, and a family, and the good labor,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.180]   the things that we've been doing, the fruits of our labor, there you go.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.700]   And then I'm excited, we have Henriette,
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.380]   and she's going to be preaching about when work becomes an idol.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.180]   And I think that's a very real thing, and so excited about that,
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.340]   and then finally we're going to talk about giving God glory through our work.
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.180]   So super excited about this series.
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.140]   I believe that God wants to renew,
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:43.260]   or even give us a new vision for what it means to be human.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.940]   And he wants to lead us into a deeper, a fuller,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.340]   a more beautiful, a more hopeful life,
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.140]   and give us courage and faith to live into this.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.500]   And I also believe that this whole series, Cumulatively,
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.260]   will be a way of how we head into uncharted waters, uncharted territories.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.260]   So I'm excited, and I hope you are as well.
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.100]   Yes, thank you, Justin was excited, good.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   One person, woo!
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   All right, well, today we're in the book of Genesis.
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.500]   Let me set a little bit of context for our message.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.340]   So Genesis, first book of the Bible, deals with creation,
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.980]   it deals with the fall, with how sin unravels things,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.940]   and then it deals with redemption, how God starts redeeming
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.620]   and starts restoring that which has been broken,
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.780]   which has been twisted, which has been damaged.
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.620]   And we're going to look at a scripture that's part of the creation narrative,
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.140]   and it has a lot to say to us, actually, about a purpose for work.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.140]   And so that's what we're going to be looking at.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.300]   So let me take you to Genesis, chapter 1, verse 26, it says this,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.100]   "Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness,
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.820]   so that they may rule over the fish and the sea,
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.620]   and the birds in the sky, over livestock,
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.780]   and all the wild animals,
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.100]   and over all the creatures that move along on the ground.'
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.460]   So God created mankind in His own image.
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.380]   In the image of God, He created them.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.180]   Male and female, He created them.
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.340]   God blessed them and said to them,
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.660]   'Be fruitful and increase in number, fill the earth and subdue it.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.340]   Rule over the fish and the sea, and the birds in the sky,
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.100]   and over every living creature that moves on the ground.'"
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.460]   So this is God's word.
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.500]   In verse 26, God is talking,
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.860]   and He's revealing that His plan is to let us make mankind in our image,
[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.460]   in our likeness.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.740]   And then in verse 27, we're told by the narrator
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.540]   that God acts on what He decided He will do.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.100]   God created mankind in His own image.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.300]   In the image of God, He created them male and female.
[00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.300]   Now, of course, this raises the question,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.140]   what does it mean to be made in the image of God?
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.140]   It seems to me like an obvious question,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.140]   but there actually is a lot of discussion,
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.020]   and there's a lot around all of that.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.900]   And I want to begin, not to fully answer,
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.060]   but to begin talking about this,
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.620]   I want to tell you a little bit about the cultural background
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.260]   in which these words were spoken,
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.300]   which is the ancient Near East.
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.260]   And so in Egypt and Mesopotamia,
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:47.820]   there were kings and rulers,
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.260]   or high-ranking officials,
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.100]   so 0.000001% of the population,
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:59.860]   they were referred to as being in the image of God,
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:05.380]   representing God in this world.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.860]   And so what Genesis is saying here is absolutely radical.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.740]   It's amazing, because he is, Genesis is saying,
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:21.740]   being made in the image of God is not just for the 0.000001%,
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.860]   every single person is made in the image of God.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.180]   So we are all royal.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.460]   It's not just one person that is royal,
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.620]   every single human being is royal.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.580]   You are kings and queens,
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.980]   whether or not you accept that title for yourself,
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.260]   or you maybe don't want to share that work with others,
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.860]   "Hey, I'm a king."
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.380]   But that's what scripture says you are.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.980]   In God's eyes, every person is royal,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.260]   not just a king or a high-ranking official.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.660]   Every person is made in the image of God.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:05.140]   Men and women all have equal dignity, worth and value.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.740]   And this is not even true in terms of what many cultures say today.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.860]   But this is what God's word said such a long time ago.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.500]   This is what God revealed.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.260]   This is powerful.
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.860]   But let's continue unpacking what it means to be made in the image of God.
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.220]   Now, theologians and biblical scholars,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.860]   they generally have three perspectives.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.340]   They break it down differently,
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.180]   but it's generally three perspectives
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.660]   on what it means to be made in the image of God.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.180]   Before I get into them, I'm going to say I think they all have merit.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.740]   I don't think it's like one and not the other.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.780]   I think all of them just round out the picture.
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.660]   But I'm going to give you the first two,
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.420]   and then the third one I'm going to unpack from our passage.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.420]   So the first one is known as a substantive view.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.660]   And it holds that being made in the image of God
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.620]   means that humans possess inherent qualities, attributes, or capacities
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:09.740]   such as reason, morality, or spirituality that reflect God's nature.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.740]   So that means that we're God-like in the sense
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:18.100]   that we have that dimension as part of our being.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.140]   And that's what distinguishes us from the rest of creation.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.780]   So that's what the first view says.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.420]   The second one is what's known as a relational view.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.660]   And that holds that being made in the image of God
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.580]   means that we uniquely have the capacity
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.380]   for a personal relationship with God
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.820]   in a way that other creatures do not have.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.860]   So we're made as relational beings,
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:45.620]   and ultimately we're made for this relationship with God.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.060]   And so that's part of what it means to be made in the image of God.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.420]   But then the third one is known as the functional view.
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.580]   And that's the one that's important as today the topic that we're trying to explore.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.220]   So that's why I'm going to unpack this one a little bit more.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.620]   And so in order to unpack that, let me take you to verse 26.
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.220]   And it says this, "Let us make mankind in our image and our likeness
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.540]   so that we may rule."
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:17.620]   So now we see here that being made in the image of God,
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.540]   that there is a connection with ruling.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.220]   And again, it's royal language.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.220]   Like I said, you're kings and you're queens.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.740]   It is royal language.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.220]   And that's how we're meant to relate to creation.
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.140]   But I want to unpack with you the word "rule."
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.620]   The Hebrew word for "rule" is "rada."
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:43.740]   And it means to have dominion, to rule, to dominate.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.420]   And ultimately what this word is saying is that God has placed you in a position
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:55.420]   as a ruler to represent Him and to represent His purposes.
[00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:00.700]   So not how you want to rule, but to rule as a representative of God
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.700]   with God's good purposes in mind.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:09.900]   So that's how this part, this functional view,
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.300]   starts describing what it means to be in the image of God.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.380]   You are rulers.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.300]   You are meant to represent God and His purposes in this world.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.980]   And so the functional view means being made in the image of God
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.940]   entails a specific role humans are given to act as God's representers
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:27.020]   by ruling over creation.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.980]   So that is the third view.
[00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.100]   And so we see that here in verse 26.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:41.500]   But what I want you to notice here too is that we're in paradise.
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.060]   We're in the Garden of Eden.
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.460]   And God is creating us.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.060]   For one, the Bible starts off, even the first birth,
[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.340]   with that God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:55.140]   So the Bible starts off with God working.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.140]   And then here it talks about us being created.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.140]   And it also talks about that we are created for this role,
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.900]   at least in part.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.420]   It's not everything we're created for, but at least in part,
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.340]   we are created to work.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.660]   And so that means that work is actually part of God's good creation,
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.740]   of God's good blessings for us.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:21.740]   Work has always been part of God's purpose for us.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.100]   Now, as I mentioned, Pastor Chapman, he will talk about the challenges,
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.580]   the frustrations, the annoyances, the difficulties,
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.420]   the fruitlessness with work.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.340]   He got the good topic.
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.700]   He gets a complaint next week.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.140]   But work is good.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.380]   It's a blessing from God.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.900]   Now, I don't know what sort of context you grew up in.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.460]   The way I grew up in was work was not talked about as being good,
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.340]   where I grew up, not even in my family.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.580]   It was talked about as you're just trying to get through work for the evening.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.420]   You're trying to get through work so you can enjoy the weekend.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:06.260]   And you're trying to work as hard as you can so that you can have retirement early,
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.420]   at age 40, I missed the boat, sorry, too late,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.420]   so that you can live the good life.
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.460]   That's the message that I grew up with.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.060]   But that is not a biblical perspective.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.100]   It's context that work is good.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.380]   We are created to do good works.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.780]   And it's part of our makeup.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.060]   And I don't know if you've experienced this.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:38.860]   I have, where you've been in a period without work.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:45.660]   And I think when we go through that, we can sense that something is missing.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.580]   Because it's difficult.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.700]   Before I went through it the first time, I thought it would be great.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.900]   It's like, yay, vacation.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.260]   It's not vacation.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.780]   It impacts your mental health, your emotional, physical, spiritual well-being.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.980]   It is tough.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.860]   And I think all of that points, again, to the fact that we are created to work.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.820]   That that is part of God's good purpose for us.
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.980]   Now, work might be twisted by sin and by evil,
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.180]   and maybe there are situations we need to get out of.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.340]   But fundamentally, it is true that work is good.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.860]   So I thought it was important to clarify that.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:29.260]   But I want to character further what it means to rule and reign.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.980]   And so we're going to look at verse 28.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:36.220]   And it says there that God blessed them and said to them,
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.580]   "Be fruitful and increase a number.
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.380]   Fill the earth and subdue it."
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:48.340]   And so I want to talk quickly about what it means to be fruitful.
[00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.420]   So again, you say that it also talks about ruling,
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.980]   so that weird rada comes up here again.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.660]   But it talks about being fruitful, and it talks about subduing,
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.300]   and I want to quickly touch on those two things.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.380]   So being fruitful and increasing a number,
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.780]   I think in some sense that's straightforward, right?
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.580]   Get married, have children.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.020]   But there's actually more to that.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:19.180]   Because it's not just about having a bunch of individuals spread over the earth.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.180]   It's actually about making civilization.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.220]   It's about society, about filling the earth with community.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.820]   So there's another dimension to it, which doesn't have anything to do
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.860]   whether or not you have children or not.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:36.380]   You can contribute to filling the earth with civilization and community.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.660]   So that's the first thing.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.660]   The second one is subdue.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.260]   And the Hebrew word is "kabas," and it means to subdue,
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:48.020]   to bring into bondage and to violate.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.820]   That is quite an intense word.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:58.180]   And actually, in the 1960s, there was a paper published
[00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:06.340]   that accused Christianity of being responsible for the environmental destruction.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.860]   And it refers to this word and this verse.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.740]   Now, of course, that's a misreading and it's read out of context,
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.100]   because what this means here is, yes, it's a strong language,
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:22.900]   but you see, God created the world and there is untapped potential.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:29.100]   The ground needs to be worked to bring forth the purposes that God has for it.
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.700]   And so that is what this is referring to.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.380]   And remember, we're God's representative,
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:37.580]   and we need to represent God in a way that honors him.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.060]   So subduing falls within this.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.900]   But let me take you to one more passage,
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.100]   and it's in Genesis 2, verse 8 through 15.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.420]   And I'm just going to read 15 for now,
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:56.460]   and then later on I'll comment on some of the other verses.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.140]   And it says this in verse 15, Genesis 2, verse 15.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.980]   "The Lord God took the man and he put him in the garden
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.460]   to work it and to take care of it."
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.660]   So there is to work it and to take care of it,
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.060]   and these are the last two words.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.140]   I know there's a lot of words today.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.660]   These are the last two words that I want to use to characterize
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.140]   what it means to rule, what it means to be image bearers of God.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.980]   And then, of course, we're going to tie it all together
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.420]   and how this relates to our work, right?
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.620]   But the first one I want to talk about, take care, which is shamar.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:32.500]   And it means to take care, to keep, to watch over, to preserve,
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.860]   to protect, to guard, to police, to cultivate, to develop,
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.060]   to draw out something's potential.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:43.580]   Wow, to draw out something's potential.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:53.100]   Now, if you go back to Genesis 2, 8 through 15,
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.340]   there in verses 10 through 14,
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.540]   these are verses I always just rushed over reading,
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.460]   and even to a point almost like, "Why are they there?"
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.100]   You know, a river watering the garden, and it talks about four rivers,
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.740]   and then it talks about gold in the ground,
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.940]   and aromatic raisins, and onyx.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.820]   Well, in view of us being created in the image of God
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:27.260]   and us being meant to take care of the garden
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.860]   and unleashing the untapped potential, wow, this makes sense.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:39.100]   And what this really means is that God's creation,
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:44.260]   it was not a finished product, but it was a project.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.020]   And that's quite different. A finished product is something that's done.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.940]   But a project is something that needs to be carried forward.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.940]   So God didn't create a finished world,
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:58.860]   he made it so that it would need our work to reach its full potential.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.540]   We're meant to carry forward with these resources
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:08.020]   and all that God has given us to bring it to its full potential,
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.940]   to see it fully unfold.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.180]   And God invites us as co-creators,
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.980]   of course under him and not in the same capacity,
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.740]   but to be rulers who cultivate,
[00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.260]   who make incredible things, beautiful things,
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:28.260]   and who through that bring God glory.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.580]   So God has a future in mind of where this whole world is heading,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.020]   and we are part of bringing this future about.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.940]   And if you actually think of scripture in Genesis 1-2,
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.420]   it's the Garden of Eden, what we've been looking at,
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:47.180]   and then you think of Revelations chapter 21 and 22,
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.700]   which is the last book of the Bible.
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.780]   So one is the first book of the Bible, the other one is the last book of the Bible.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.020]   And it talks about the new Eden,
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.980]   which is basically heaven coming down, the new Jerusalem coming down.
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.140]   And what's interesting is instead of a garden, it's a city.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.420]   It has been cultivated.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.460]   And there's actually some of those resources that we saw in this verse,
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.780]   they're actually being used in that city,
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.500]   and they've been shaped and formed.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:18.020]   So God, part of our calling is to bring to unfolding and to bring full purpose
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.940]   this creation that He has placed us in, this garden that He has placed us in.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:32.420]   And we're meant to be part of this beautiful, this amazing, this incredible work.
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:37.700]   Now, there's a second word, and this is the last one.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.660]   I promise, last word, many words.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.820]   In Genesis 2-15, and that's the word "work."
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.700]   You're like, "Why do we need to unpack the word 'work'?"
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.860]   Well, in Hebrew, it's "avad."
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:57.780]   And it means the service to God, it means service to people,
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.620]   but it also means worship.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.780]   And so our work and worship, they're not two separate ideas.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.460]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:14.700]   That the Hebrew word for work and worship is the same word.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.580]   And so when you read throughout Hebrew scripture, through the Old Testament,
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:24.580]   when it talks about word, it is the same word for worship.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.180]   So it shows that there is a thin line between those two things,
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.460]   and that they are connected.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.700]   But it's interesting, because earlier with my story,
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.660]   I showed how we have totally disconnected them.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.900]   You know, we've bought into the lie that their sacred work,
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.220]   being a pastor, being a missionary, working for an NGO,
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:53.380]   running finance seminars, in addition to what you're already doing,
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.020]   but God never made that distinction.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.900]   He never made that distinction.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.420]   It's something that we did.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.740]   And it really has cut the feet from underneath us
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.940]   to understand our purposes in our workplaces
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.380]   that God has placed us in.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:18.500]   And so for me, when I was working as a financial advisor
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:24.100]   for Morgan Stanley Investing, Personal Institutional Finances,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.540]   now this is part of the cultivating, the ruling work
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:30.060]   that God has entrusted us with.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.740]   It is part of organizing and bringing order out of chaos.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.260]   It is part of moving forward God's creation project
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.460]   to something better, something more beautiful.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:48.020]   And that is worship.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.260]   That is part of the cultivation work.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.340]   So when you care for your family,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.780]   when you create something beautiful,
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.820]   when you solve problems at work,
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.820]   when you cultivate relationships,
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.540]   when you steward the earth,
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.020]   you're not just getting things done.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.100]   You're gathering up creation's praise
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:16.900]   and you're offering it back to God as you worship.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.340]   Now that's quite a fancy way of saying something.
[00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.900]   Let me say a little bit about that.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.020]   Psalm 119, verse 1 says,
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.740]   "The heavens declare the glory of God."
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.180]   Throughout scripture, it talks about that creation
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.500]   is worshiping God.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.940]   It gives God praise.
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.860]   And so when we do this cultivation work
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:44.020]   with the resources, with ideas, giving meaning to things,
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.340]   we're gathering up the worship of creation
[00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.940]   and then we're directing it to God.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.620]   And for some reason, this cultivating and this gathering up,
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.420]   it brings God greater glory.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.780]   So when you do your work in this way,
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.660]   it brings God a greater glory.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.700]   It gives God worship in your work.
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.980]   Isn't that incredible?
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:20.460]   I find that such a beautiful vision for our lives,
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.020]   for what it means to be human,
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.020]   for what God has purposed us for.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:32.780]   Now, all of this is known as the cultural mandate.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.820]   So mandate is actually commandment.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.420]   This is something that God commanded us to do, to rule.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.540]   You are commanded to rule.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.860]   You're commanded to be a king and a queen
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:47.340]   in your plot of land and to make something of it
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.980]   and to shape it and to form it and to give it meaning,
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:57.060]   to gather up the worship, to enhance the praise,
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.900]   the glory of God.
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.700]   Now, that's probably not the way that we've been thinking
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.940]   about our work, has it?
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.340]   Hasn't it been, right?
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.500]   But that's what God's word teaches us and shows us
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.020]   and is inviting us into.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:19.380]   So I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.340]   So this brings me back to the question that I asked
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.580]   at the beginning of the message.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.180]   Does God have a greater purpose for our work
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.140]   than most of us have ever imagined?
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.820]   And I think we can start seeing it.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.860]   Of course, there's a lot to unpack even with what I said.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.020]   But I think we can start seeing it,
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.940]   that there is a greater purpose for us,
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.300]   whether it's paid work or unpaid work.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.620]   You don't have to quit your job.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.300]   You don't have to do an extra seminar
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.380]   that is explicitly Christian to do work
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.060]   that is worship to God.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.340]   Your work is already connected to your faith.
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.700]   Maybe we struggle to see it how.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.980]   Well, then our job is to figure out how this is connected.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:19.500]   And so we get to carry this project of creation forward
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.900]   to its culmination,
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.780]   to where there's a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.980]   What we do now matters.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.020]   Some of the things we do now,
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.100]   they will carry forward into God's new world
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:30.660]   through you.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.980]   God wants to bring in the kingdom,
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.380]   His reign, His will.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:39.220]   Wherever you do work that reflects God's will
[00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.340]   for that plot of land,
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.100]   you know, the kingdom is coming.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.180]   It is breaking in.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.060]   It is honoring God.
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.380]   It's giving Him glory.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.580]   So how do we connect our faith and work?
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:57.300]   How do we connect God's purposes for us with our work?
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.620]   Well, I want to give you two things.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.980]   The first one is we need to embrace God's view of work
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.300]   and of ourselves.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.220]   Actually, this is a renewal of the mind.
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:16.140]   This is a transformational way of how we need to look at ourselves.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.900]   You are made in the image of God.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.420]   You are made to reign, to cultivate, to shape,
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.660]   to bring order out of chaos,
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.060]   to give meaning, to make beautiful things,
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.540]   new things, to solve problems,
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.140]   to shape and form students.
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.180]   These students are going to summer school.
[00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.300]   That is part of the beautiful cultivating and shaping work
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.500]   that God invites us into.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.860]   But we need to see work that way.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.140]   We need to see ourselves that way.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.860]   So maybe the starting point for you today
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.220]   to connect your work with your faith
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.380]   is to start seeing what work is
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.020]   and what your role is that God has given you in a new light.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.060]   So I have some questions for you.
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:59.060]   What is my current view of work?
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:04.260]   How is God inviting me to align my view more with his word?
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:09.260]   Do I need to repent of a negative view of work
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:16.660]   and replace it with a positive biblical view?
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.700]   So that's the first thing.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.700]   The second one is we need to embrace our identity
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.020]   as culture makers.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.780]   Now, a culture maker is, yes, it's artists.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.980]   It's musicians who organize, paint pigments,
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.660]   and sounds that resonate.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.220]   Resonance?
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.140]   I always get it wrong.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.060]   And that is beautiful culture making work.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:54.460]   But so is when a mother develops a new way of every night
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.780]   you're reading a story to your child.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.260]   That is also culture making.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:00.260]   You're setting a culture.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:06.900]   When you solve a problem at work,
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.580]   when you transform something, when you create a better
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.300]   environment with your team that you're working with,
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.980]   that is culture making.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.300]   Every one of us is a culture maker.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.500]   You are a culture maker.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.860]   But we need to embrace our role.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.860]   You know, one thing I was thinking about was--
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.820]   so I'm a girl dad, and I'm very proud of it.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.860]   And my little girl is two years old,
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.300]   and she's drawing kind of--
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.540]   let's call it circles and lines.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:44.460]   But she is so proud, and she delights in her work.
[00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.340]   And I believe one of the reasons why that is is
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.140]   that we have to embrace our role.
[00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.740]   I believe one of the reasons why that is so
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.460]   is because she is created to be a culture maker.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.660]   She's created to make things.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.300]   And when she does that, it brings her delight and joy.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.020]   And it's the same for us.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.380]   That's why doing a good job feels so good.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.860]   That's why solving a problem feels so good.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.820]   That's why completing a project feels so good.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.060]   Because we're made for this.
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.180]   It's part of who God made us.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.620]   And so some questions we can ask ourselves
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:30.660]   is, what good can I make or cultivate here,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.340]   where God has placed you?
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:39.100]   How can I contribute to the world's and people's
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.180]   flourishing?
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.540]   How can I move this project along, God's good project,
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.100]   in my plot of land?
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:52.860]   Now, we don't do all of this out of our own strength.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.180]   We do this by the power of Jesus,
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.820]   because he died for our sins, and he rose.
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:03.500]   And all who believe in him, they are new creations.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.660]   There is a restoration of who we are.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.900]   And it allows us to more fully live out
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.940]   the potential for what we can do.
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.620]   To more fully live out the potential for which God
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.180]   has created us.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:21.100]   And so we can rely on God's grace,
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:25.980]   and God can do immeasurably more through you, the culture
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.700]   maker, than you can imagine.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.620]   But my question is, are we going to believe God?
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.860]   Are we going to go for it?
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.780]   Are we going to embrace that role?
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:41.420]   I'm going to leave you with one question.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.060]   What if the uncharted territory for many of us
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:51.420]   isn't a new destination, but a new way of understanding
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.700]   God's purpose for our work?
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:59.940]   What if God wants to do something radically beautiful
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:04.540]   and new through you as you embrace your role as image
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.580]   of bearers of God, as rulers, as representers
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.700]   in your sphere of influence?
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.400]   So church, I want to invite you to stand.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.360]   I want to pray over us.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:29.620]   Jesus, I thank you so much for all
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.300]   that you've been doing in our community.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.900]   I thank you for every single person here
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.860]   that is made in your image.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.460]   I thank you that there is more to our work
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.100]   that you are inviting us into, that it
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.260]   doesn't have to be so disconnected from our faith,
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.580]   our Mondays through Saturdays.
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.900]   Like, you have a purpose for us, and we
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.140]   can worship you through that as we
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:58.260]   learn to embrace a role that you have given us.
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.740]   And Lord, so I--
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.780]   you know where everyone's on this journey.
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:07.340]   I pray that you would meet us, that you would lead us
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:13.180]   to the Holy Spirit and to the beautiful, good purposes
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.140]   you have for us.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.940]   And I pray that you will do immeasurably more
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.620]   as we shape culture, as we use whatever
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.860]   is on our plot of land to bring you glory,
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:34.540]   to gather up your creation's worship, and to turn it to you.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:38.140]   And I pray that you give us the--
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.700]   that you touch us by your spirit to actually work this out,
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.020]   to not just let this be, oh, that
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.500]   was a nice way of looking at things
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.020]   and move on with our regular.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:52.020]   Lord, but I pray that you lead us in uncharted territory,
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.700]   and that we get to know you in a new way.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.860]   And Lord, I also want to pray for those of us who
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:01.500]   are struggling with work and finding work or finding
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.700]   meaningful work, whether paid or unpaid, Lord.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.260]   And I pray for your provision.
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.420]   I pray that we can help each other,
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:15.020]   that we can connect each other to places of work.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.820]   And so I also lift up those that are in need of that right now.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.500]   So we love you, Lord, and we want
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.500]   to worship you through our work and also through our song.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.980]   And I pray this in your name, Jesus.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.980]   Amen.
