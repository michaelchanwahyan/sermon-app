[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300]   Why don't you have a seat?
[00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.140]   Why should you do so?
[00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.120]   Turn around and say hi to someone
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.440]   that you did not meet beforehand.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.600]   Say hi, who are you?
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's very nice to meet you.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   Give me your name.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.440]   Please say hi, be friendly.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.280]   All right.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.400]   Well, I'm super excited that we get to continue
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.480]   our Philippian series today.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000]   Okay, that's enough friendliness for one day, thank you.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.300]   Just kidding.
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.120]   We're getting to continue our Philippian series
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   in Alternative Society.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.760]   If you've been here at the Vine for the last number of weeks
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.400]   you'll know that we're in a series
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.000]   where we're looking at Paul's vision
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.280]   for the local community of church.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.800]   His vision for how the church could shine
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.720]   in the community around them.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.960]   And this is exactly the topic that we're looking at today.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.880]   I'm really grateful that we got Sidney Yip,
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.400]   chairman of our eldership with us today,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.120]   friend of many in this church,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.800]   someone who served this church for many years
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.280]   with Vivian and their family.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.600]   Why don't you stretch out your hands with me
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.100]   and I'm gonna pray for Sidney.
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.760]   Father, we thank you for Sidney and Vivian.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.000]   We thank you for their leadership,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.800]   their partnership together in marriage.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.000]   Lord, we thank you for Sidney's passion
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   for your word, his heart.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.560]   Lord, we thank you for the skills that you've given him
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   in the marketplace as a surgeon, a doctor.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.880]   And Lord, as he pours out his heart towards us today
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.200]   in this area of holiness,
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.920]   Lord, we come to you afresh with that vision of the hill
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.660]   that we are ascending by you.
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.160]   And Lord, we pray for this pure and blameless spirit
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.140]   to be in us and through us.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.900]   We pray that we would be able to live, Lord,
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.960]   as the people of God in the way that you called us to live.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.400]   So would you open this word to us, Lord, through Sidney.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760]   Would our hearts be fertile soil
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.000]   for the things that you want to say to us today?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.080]   And God, we thank you for this
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.320]   and we give you praise in Jesus' name.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.960]   Everyone says amen.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.120]   - Amen.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.400]   Well, thank you, Andrew.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.200]   Many years back while I was still working in Singapore,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.240]   I got an invitation to speak
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.000]   in a medical conference here in Hong Kong.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.360]   So the organizers were very generous.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.880]   They put me up in a six-star hotel.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   Well, whatever it means.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.300]   That was well before this vacation becomes a phenomenon.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.200]   But interestingly, right after that visit to Hong Kong,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.400]   I was to fly out to Indonesia
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.200]   to join a medical mission team.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.120]   So that was right after the double jeopardy
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   of tsunami and earthquake
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.020]   in the outskirt Indonesian island.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.440]   So for all those 10 days,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.860]   we were staying out in all-stars hotels.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.140]   Well, by all-stars, we are really tenting out
[00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.760]   because after the earthquake,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.280]   we don't dare to stay in-house.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   But that sleeping out in the open
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.160]   allowed us the perfect occasion
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.160]   to glaze upon the stars
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.380]   in mere darkness in the countryside.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.840]   So that would help us recall
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.260]   the painting by Vincent van Gogh, Starry Night,
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.420]   well, that was told to be the easiest,
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.620]   the comprehensible pictures of his making.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.340]   Anyway, actually, it's more than 2,000 years ago,
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.340]   Paul had already in mind about morning stars that shine.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.580]   In Philippians chapter two, it's said,
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.960]   so that you may become blameless and pure,
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.860]   children of God, without fault,
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.960]   in a crooked and twisted generation,
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.840]   that you will shine among them like stars in the sky.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.600]   So it remains for us to ponder
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.160]   what shining morning stars really means
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.540]   as we continue our Alternative Society series,
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.120]   a new way of living,
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.340]   paying particular attention to holiness.
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.960]   Well, this study will demand
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.260]   more than your usual attention, is that okay?
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.120]   Okay, therefore, my dear friends,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.620]   as you have always obeyed,
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.640]   not only in my presence, but also in my absence,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.460]   continue to work out your salvation
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.880]   with fear and trembling.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.380]   For it is God who works in you
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.380]   to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.760]   Therefore, do everything without grumbling or arguing,
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.720]   so that you may become blameless and pure,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.220]   children of God, without fault,
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.260]   in a crooked and twisted generation.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.260]   Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky,
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.420]   as you hold firmly to the word of life.
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.320]   So in a nutshell, the Philippians were to devote themselves
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.320]   to practical Christianity, working out their salvation.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.200]   Then they were to be characterized
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.720]   by positive steadfastness,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.080]   never scramble to complaining or grumbling.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.060]   So in short, God is a holy God.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.000]   He chooses for himself a people
[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.380]   and confer holiness to his people.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.880]   And we, the holy people, are to live our holy lives.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.540]   So for practical Christianity,
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.800]   it is for us to work out our salvation
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.340]   with fear and trembling,
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.460]   because it is God who works in us.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.360]   Now last, we are caught up with the theological debate
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.560]   between work and salvation.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.260]   So for today, it's suffix to understand
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.260]   that the dynamics of salvation is already, not yet.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.060]   Using a word of play,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.280]   Paul said that they were to work out because God works in.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.800]   God works in them and provide them the motivation
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.520]   and the ability to do his good pleasure.
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.860]   Now this passage actually recalls
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.780]   the Philippians 1 passage,
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.460]   where Paul expressed his confidence in them
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.220]   because what God has begun, a good work,
[00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.380]   he would bring it to completion.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.380]   How then is it best for us to understand fear and trembling?
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.560]   That brings us to the original notion
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.080]   of who our holy God is,
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.420]   and that would necessitate a quick look
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.160]   at the Old Testament.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.660]   Now holiness in the Hebrew Bible
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.160]   is intrinsically connected to God, his very being.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.740]   God is the holy one par excellence,
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.500]   with the exclusive power to confer holiness unto others.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   Not only is God the source of holiness,
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.080]   but human bodies like us will require holiness
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.320]   in order to be in proximity to the deity.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.400]   Now we often think of getting prepared
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.980]   as the Israelites through the sacrificial system,
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.680]   gaining access to the most high.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.560]   So for illustration,
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.660]   many of you are aware that I practice surgery.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.100]   So how we prepare to gain access to the operating room,
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.800]   the holy place, bears some resemblance.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.220]   To go into the operating theater,
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.960]   we need to get changed into necessary gears,
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.520]   masks, hair cover, scrubs, and boots.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.480]   But this is only the beginning.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.280]   To get into the operating room and be involved in surgery,
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.320]   we actually need to go through another round of cleansing.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.400]   We have to scrub for at least three minutes
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.280]   using antiseptic lotions.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.800]   That's why Vivian always says,
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.760]   "Well, my hands are very smooth."
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.680]   (audience laughs)
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.440]   Well, then we have to put on sterile gongs and gloves.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.160]   In fact, it is advisable to use double gloves.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.480]   Now this is a mutual protection
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.620]   for patients and for ourselves.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.680]   Back in the days of SARS, or even in this COVID season,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.000]   gaining access to patients' airways
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.840]   as in giving anesthesia before surgery
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.800]   is actually considered high-risk procedures
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.980]   for the medical personnel.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.400]   In fact, years back, we lost quite a few colleagues
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.240]   while they are doing intubation.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.240]   We have to gong up using higher standard N95 mask,
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.800]   and also what we call astronauts' OT costumes.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.160]   Now even with all those,
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.600]   we really come forth in fear and trembling,
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.520]   as we are never 100% sure that we are prepared
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.040]   and fortness to face the dire consequence
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.260]   of not being good enough.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.720]   With that in mind, it may be easier for us to understand
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   why the Israelites, as they come before God, Yahweh,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.040]   in the Mount Sinai,
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.800]   they would rather that Moses approach God on their behalf.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.320]   Now however, while much emphasis was laid
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.520]   on maintaining cleanliness by the holiness code
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.240]   to come before God,
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.220]   the status of holiness was actually conferred
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.800]   in the first place.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.920]   In Exodus, the Israelites were summoned
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.560]   into a special relationship with God,
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.120]   described by three phrases,
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.960]   a special possession amongst all peoples,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.120]   a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.520]   Israel is to be God's own people,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.400]   set apart from other nations for its own service,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.640]   just as priests were set apart
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.620]   and marked by a quality of life in alignment
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.360]   with the holiness of the covenant with God.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.980]   Israel is holy because she is called by God
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.100]   as its own people.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.580]   However, holiness should not be narrowly understood
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.640]   as separation or just setting apart.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.260]   Israelites' holiness has a communal implication.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.140]   It is to be manifested in social relationships
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.800]   with strangers, with the poor,
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.860]   and with the surrounding nations.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.180]   In their shared living,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.420]   Israel is called to model the life of the Godhead,
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.580]   to live out the love, the goodness, and justice of God
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.800]   for the nations to see and be drawn to.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.020]   Now fast forward to the New Testament era.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.740]   It is helpful to recall the words of Hebrews.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.860]   Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.780]   so that we may receive mercy and grace
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.240]   to help us in times of need,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.140]   that we may come before a holy God
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.360]   at any time of our needs.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.500]   It's really made possible by the death and resurrection
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.420]   of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.280]   We'll have a bit more of elaboration next week on this.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.440]   Now a New Testament approach to understanding,
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.800]   approaching the holy God,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.420]   is in fact best illustrated in the last prayer.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.740]   This then is how you should pray,
[00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.580]   our Father in heaven, may your holy name be honored.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:42.020]   As a father of two grown up adults in their late 20s,
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.440]   I would not like them to come to me in fear and trembling.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.120]   Nor I expect them to come in perfection.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.760]   I just treasure that they come to me
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.780]   as often as they desire.
[00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.960]   The interesting paradox we have
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.440]   for modern day believers is rather,
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.520]   now that we can come forth to a heavenly father
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.360]   at any time without fear,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:12.240]   do we really come to him as often as he desires?
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.120]   So what is Paul's thought on holiness
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.640]   as reflected in the Philippians?
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.800]   It might be helpful to reconnect today's passage
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.420]   to the prayer in chapter one,
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.640]   as well as the drive to perfection,
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.740]   as would be mentioned in chapter three.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.980]   Philippians one, and this is my prayer,
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.840]   that your love may abound more and more
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.520]   in knowledge and depth of insight,
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.760]   so that you may be able to discern what is best
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.680]   in order that you may be pure and blameless
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.920]   until the day of Christ,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.140]   filled with the fruits of righteousness.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.360]   As one examines the prayer, it become evident
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.160]   that Paul is concerned with the holiness of the Philippians.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   Paul expect them to live a holy life in the presence,
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.160]   even as they anticipate the day of Christ.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.880]   Thus holiness is the moral character of our life,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.800]   here and now, that will prepare us to stand the test
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.640]   of that great day, whenever it come.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.120]   Towards chapter three, the emphasis of holiness,
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.800]   of it being a process,
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.340]   is best illustrated by Paul's own commitment.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.360]   Not that I've already obtained this, or am already perfect,
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.500]   but I press on to make it my own,
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.500]   because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.800]   So a quick summary of what we have
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.000]   on Paul's thinking of holiness.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.420]   Number one, Paul's call for holiness
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.640]   is greatly influenced by his outlook for the future,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.720]   namely the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   Second, the holiness that Paul calls his church
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.360]   is both corporate and personal.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.600]   We are to shine together as a community.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.840]   And third, the word perfection reminds us
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.840]   that we maintain the tension which exists in the words,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.200]   to make perfect, as a verb, and perfect as an adjective.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.200]   Well, actually, to put it in very simple terms,
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.260]   it is work in progress.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:44.040]   Now, let's come back to our anchor verses in chapter two,
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.480]   where Paul's understanding of holiness
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.660]   is primarily communal.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.680]   We become related to Christ singly,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   but we cannot live in Christ as isolated individuals.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.400]   God is not just making individuals holy,
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.160]   which he certainly does,
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.080]   but he's making a people holy.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.000]   How about positive steadfastness?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.600]   Philippians 2 remind us,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.800]   "To do all things without grumbling or questioning,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.320]   that you may be blameless and innocent,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.520]   children of God without blemish,
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.440]   in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation."
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.440]   Paul uses the language in the Psalms of Moses
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.740]   that stands near the end of Deuteronomy,
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.240]   that describes the unfaithfulness
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.680]   of a wicked generation of Israelites
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.560]   who were brought out of Egypt.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.480]   They grumble as a sign of their mistrust
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.100]   in the goodness of God.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.520]   Now, Paul believes that the Philippians
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.040]   were to stand in continuity of the ancient call of God.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.520]   Paul's exhortation on holiness to the Philippians
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.820]   is that they are to live as God's holy people
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.580]   in a dark world that Paul describes in its darkest terms
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.400]   as crooked and perverse.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   If the Philippians can succeed in fulfilling this vocation,
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.720]   they will shine as stars in the universe
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.760]   as they hold on to the word of life.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.680]   This is the vocation that according to Isaiah,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.960]   Israel was supposed to carry,
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.720]   to be the light amongst the Gentiles,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.880]   so that the salvation of God
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.160]   might be brought to the ends of the earth.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.400]   Paul's exhortation presents holiness
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.520]   both in negative and positive terms.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.880]   In a negative sense, Paul called upon the Philippians
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.420]   to shy from grumbling and questioning.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.920]   So, do not grumble.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.280]   Now, in my own workplace context,
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.260]   different development strategies
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.900]   eventually precipitates the breakdown
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.000]   of a very longstanding partnership in the company.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.180]   That we have different financial goals
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.440]   as a business entity is entirely understandable.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.500]   What was very painful and hurtful
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.160]   was the grumbles and complaints even before we parted ways,
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.320]   and it had a tremendous impact, even on myself.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.880]   I'm hoping that as a church body,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.660]   we can do better than in a secular setting.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.580]   In fact, Paul employs three terms
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.780]   to describe the stage of readiness
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.900]   in which the believers in Philippi are to keep themselves.
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.540]   The first, blame them.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.260]   It actually appeared also in Genesis,
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.380]   whereby God commanded Abraham
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.820]   to walk before him and be blameless.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.300]   And that was exactly the idea that was echoed in Psalm.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.460]   Who may ascend to the holy mountains?
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.400]   Those who are pure in heart and clean in hands.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.620]   The second term, ignorance, is found in Matthew.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.180]   Jesus say, I'm sending you out like sheep amongst wolves.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.180]   Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes, and be ignocent as doves.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.840]   It is translated as ignorance with ethical overtones.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.340]   Christ's followers are to be characterized
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.800]   by a delicate balance of prudence and purity.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.300]   The third term, to be without blamish,
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.300]   is actually a very often Old Testament context of worship,
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.900]   whereby without blamish is applied to animals
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.540]   that were meant for sacrifice.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.240]   However, it was also used
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.700]   to describe the person's moral state.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.540]   So his call to the Philippians is really to be blameless,
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.900]   innocent, and without blamish.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.920]   He's calling for moral transformation
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.740]   in every aspect of the believer's life.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.980]   It is a life that should be beyond reproach
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.740]   in every area.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:22.580]   The Philippian Christians are to present themselves
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:27.260]   as holy and acceptable sacrifice to God.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.340]   The result of their living is that they will shine as light.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.440]   And yet, even with their imperfections,
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.900]   they could progress to become the light of the world
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.020]   to those in darkness.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.100]   So what does it mean to shine as morning star
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.240]   in our times?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.660]   I will name three areas that I learned
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.700]   from my seminary professor, teaching faith and work.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.820]   So he brought up a version of three Cs in the workplace,
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.820]   namely, competence, care, and character.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.600]   It is not difficult to understand competence.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.500]   Do with excellence.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.700]   Do it and do it well, period.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.260]   Now, however, just doing well
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.820]   without grumbling and complaining.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.980]   Grumbling may not have much bearing
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.540]   on your competence in a strict sense,
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.760]   but your reputation and that of Christ would be at stake.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.620]   On the other hand, while we work diligently,
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.020]   Jesus will always open a door
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.140]   for us to care for others in the workplace.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.900]   Our practice recently moved to a newer,
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.580]   yet more compact venue, where after all,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.780]   rental in central is prohibitively high,
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.700]   in a sense that it's also a reflection
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.980]   of the very distorted economic system
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.220]   in the deprived generation.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:01.580]   But my honest confession is that as the company
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.220]   pushes to cut cost for enhanced efficiency,
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.520]   we are driving our employees to the brink of breakdown.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.180]   Some of my staff lamented that they are losing
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.700]   the joy of serving.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.300]   So while my initial thought was to invite
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.660]   my fellow elders to come around me
[00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.560]   to bless me and my business,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.580]   in preparation that morning, I had a restaurant prompting
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.080]   that the office blessing should be about
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.740]   my colleagues and my staff.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.260]   So the few of us who gathered that morning,
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.220]   we took time to invite my staff
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.180]   to pray for them individually.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:50.220]   Really, in those weeks of tremendous stress
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.980]   from the fiscal move, the adjustments to new workflow,
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.960]   and new management changes,
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.300]   they yearned for comfort and strength,
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.640]   and are there to believe that God's light shone on them
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.000]   and illuminated their paths.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.380]   In fact, at the opportune time,
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.700]   we shall need to be bold enough
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.240]   to speak on behalf of others.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.400]   I'm a minority shareholder in my company,
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.900]   but I felt compelled to speak to the management
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.220]   regarding improvement of the staff's welfare.
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.500]   And I'm glad to be reassured by them
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.560]   that they are making every effort
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.900]   to rectify the situation, and that they care.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.940]   So be proactive.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.180]   I challenge you to come forth,
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.340]   to offer prayers for your staff,
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.340]   for your peers, and for your boss.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.180]   Why not?
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.420]   The other day, I was somewhat stressed out
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.280]   in preparation for a fairly difficult surgery.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.160]   Lo and behold, I received a text from my patient's daughter.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.800]   She encouraged me that she prayed for me,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.100]   believing that I shall be a blessing to her father.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.740]   She became my morning star, as she cared.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:20.300]   But most of all, Paul is demanding our character.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   The key for character remains fearing in reference to God.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:32.320]   By this, I mean we honor him in all our areas of living,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.140]   working, and being.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.700]   As a surgeon who had practiced for more than 30 years,
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:46.020]   I confess that actually I'm fearful many a times.
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:51.820]   While the irony is some measured fear turned out
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.820]   to be helpful for us to stay prudent for complicated,
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.200]   as much as for mundane surgeries.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.820]   The fear is not so much that there may be shortcomings
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.680]   of our own making or complications,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:11.260]   even sometimes undesirable outcomes, including mortality,
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.100]   beyond our control or understanding.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.400]   The reference is that we acknowledge,
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.300]   ultimately, God is sovereign.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.860]   He is the healer.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.440]   We are just the instruments to care.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.440]   We are the morning stars that reflect his glory.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.260]   But as stars, we can also shine together as a body.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.220]   I mentioned about the medical mission team
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.100]   for the earthquake relief,
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.420]   whereby we serve different communities
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.800]   in the outskirts Indonesian island.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.240]   We were in this shining for Christ
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.800]   for an otherwise limited assassination,
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.060]   even when the earth was literally shaken.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.980]   Here in Hong Kong,
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.740]   we are coming across a major shaking ourselves.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.740]   Richard Napole wrote a very important theological piece
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.540]   reflecting on Christ and culture.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:11.660]   He put two extreme ends.
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.660]   On the one end is Christ entirely against culture.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:22.920]   On the other end is Christ entirely for culture.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.340]   But he put forth a different way,
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.140]   Christ, or rather Christians,
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.500]   in our interaction with the culture,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.200]   we can actually transform culture,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.280]   and that may be the way out.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.840]   That is, we can take culture's fallenness seriously,
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   but continue to will and to act
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.540]   hopes for conversion within it.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.220]   While some of us may regard this
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.660]   as a gloriously impossible mission,
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.620]   but we may also argue that at the time of Paul's writing,
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.420]   the early Christian churches,
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.460]   including the Philippian church,
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.900]   they learned and practiced humility,
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.860]   self-sacrifice, joy, care for others,
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:11.640]   and most of all, fear of Jesus Christ as the Lord,
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.700]   instead of Caesar as the Lord.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.500]   Indeed, they shine and subverted the culture
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.700]   where they lived as an alternative society.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.060]   In this season, our generation may also choose
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.620]   to live out differently,
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.920]   to act out the fear and reference to our true God,
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.660]   regardless of the external society pressures.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.860]   For instance, the society may not fully appreciate
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.260]   the work of manual labors, including street cleaners,
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.220]   who actually serve us so well,
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.860]   especially in this COVID season.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.780]   Yet, the volunteers from STOB,
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.260]   under the branches of hope, they shine.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.160]   They reach out to the street cleaners in our neighborhood.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.280]   They prepare simple lunch boxes,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:06.100]   but with a lot of love, care, and respect.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.620]   And for all you know, it is because our fellow brothers
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.580]   and sisters from the Arise community
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.060]   who are able to speak their languages, they join us,
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.700]   so that this church can reach out
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.500]   to very different nationalities.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:28.980]   So in conclusion, may God find our response
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.180]   of fear and reference entirely appropriate.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.280]   We are to fear Him in the sense
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.300]   that we recognize His holiness,
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.860]   and the respect and honor due Him,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   as His heart yearns for us.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.060]   We can always approach Him,
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.060]   His throne of grace, with confidence,
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.180]   so that we may receive mercy and grace
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.540]   to help us in our times of need.
[00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:06.100]   We shall then shine as we meet the need of others.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.020]   In fact, most importantly,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.020]   we shall bring others to our holy God, even as we shine.
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.140]   (silence)
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.700]   Can I invite the worship team to come and join us?
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.680]   I'll share the story of one of my patients.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.320]   She actually, well, she literally come
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.340]   with fear and trembling.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.400]   Honestly, more before, because she was overwhelmed
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.920]   by her medical condition.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:39.100]   Yet along the way, as many come around to support her,
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.620]   to pray with her, she became much better prepared
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.260]   to proceed.
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.900]   She was learning to fear God as the sovereign,
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.040]   as well as the good God, the Holy One.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:58.820]   She made an impressive and speedy recovery,
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.440]   to the extent that she quickly volunteered to serve.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.580]   In fact, she served in our children ministry
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.020]   for the underprivileged just this summer vacation.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.140]   She served with much joy and became one
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.420]   of the most beloved volunteers.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.940]   She is shining in her own right,
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.020]   as one of the morning stars,
[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.120]   alongside with many other stars in our midst.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:30.220]   So each one of us here, we can look up the sky
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:36.220]   and envisage that we can also shine alongside many others
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:40.900]   from this congregation as morning stars.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:46.940]   Can I invite all of us to stand together as we worship,
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:52.620]   as a symbolic act, I would suggest that you bring out
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.100]   your handphone, you switch on your torch mode,
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.080]   and continue to shine as morning stars,
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.980]   even as we worship together.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.400]   (soft music)
