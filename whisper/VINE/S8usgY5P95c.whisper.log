[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   Well, in 2006, I was living in Germany, I was a youth young adults pastor, and I decided
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.520]   to join a men's basketball team.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.720]   Now you can see I'm pretty tall, but of course there's a lot taller people there too.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.680]   Now it was a pretty competitive league.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.480]   In Germany, if you're familiar with European football, you have different leagues and teams
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480]   can move up and down.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.560]   So I was in the fourth league.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.800]   And if you move up one more level, then it gets very serious.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.040]   And so I was on the team.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.640]   We had a lot of fun as a team and we won a lot.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   It was great.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.120]   You know, it's more fun when you win games, right?
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.240]   So then we got to the point in the season where we're actually tied for first place
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.120]   and we're about to play the other team that we're tied with.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.840]   And this game was going to determine probably who's going to win the league championship
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.860]   or the league title and then move up to the next league.
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.120]   And so we go into the game, we're excited and we miserably failed.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.360]   We lost that game and we were so frustrated and so disappointed because we were a lot
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.480]   better than what we played.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.240]   I guess, you know, it's one thing to lose against somebody who's better than you.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.640]   It's another thing to lose against somebody you could potentially actually beat.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.640]   And we lost.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.200]   And so we're really frustrated, discouraged, disappointed.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   Probably was it.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.680]   It was like three or four more games after the season.
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.720]   So later that week, I got a phone call.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.720]   My coach called me.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.860]   Now, my coach never called me.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.360]   So that piqued my curiosity.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.240]   And he's like, "Hey, Tim, can you come to a meeting on Tuesday nights?"
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.260]   And I was like, "Okay, what's the meeting about?"
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.680]   So he told me, "Well, the team, some of the team members, they feel that my coaching is
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.540]   fault for us losing and they want to get rid of me.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.540]   Can you come and mediate?"
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.300]   And I was like, "Okay, didn't see that one coming."
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.260]   I wasn't part of this conversation.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.020]   So I came and we talked about what was going on.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.180]   So I facilitated a conversation.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.180]   I also talked about Christian principles, like forgiveness, which this was not a Christian
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.300]   group.
[00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.860]   And we actually were able to, they were actually able to forgive each other and to move forward
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.980]   together as a team.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.020]   And now I don't want to say that everything was perfectly resolved, but it was good enough
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.460]   for us to move forward.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.580]   And I was so thankful for that because actually we had such a great time as a basketball team
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.500]   and it would be such a pity to let this conflict divide us.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.420]   Now we actually ended up winning the league title because the other team lost two more
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.420]   games.
[00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.100]   So that was a nice side thing.
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.620]   And I believe if we would have not stayed together, we probably would have lost some
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.060]   as well.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.360]   Now we all have to one degree or another experienced conflict and division.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.620]   Now for me it was in this case, happened to be in a basketball team where there was conflict
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.380]   that almost led to division.
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.080]   But we've experienced that in other settings as well.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.900]   Sometimes that might be in our families, sometimes in our friendships, sometimes it is in marriages,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.180]   sometimes it also is in churches.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.580]   So conflict and division can come in all of our spheres of life where we're broken people
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.820]   and we have different perspectives and different viewpoints and different opinions and have
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.820]   different capacities.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.700]   Sometimes we're not feeling good and we say something we didn't mean to say and something
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.260]   escalates and goes down a really bad road.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.660]   So a lot of times we just end up sitting in the mess of our conflicts.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.260]   And it's not always easy to know how can I move forward out of this conflict, how can
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.900]   I move forward out of this division with these people, with whoever it is that we have this
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.420]   conflict going on.
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.460]   And so what I want to do with you today, I want to explore with you a question and it
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.700]   says how can we keep the unity in our relationships when it is so difficult to do so?
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.380]   How do you do that?
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.740]   There are so many things that can divide us.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.220]   We have different political views.
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.040]   We know that one, right?
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.940]   We come from different generations.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.500]   So sometimes different generations we value different things and then there's a conflict
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.460]   between younger and older and older and younger generations.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.260]   We come from different cultural backgrounds that also has different values.
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.660]   We have different genders, we're men, we're women, we have different perspectives.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.660]   So on all these different things, there's all these things that can potentially, possibly
[00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.160]   divide us, bring conflict, bring this unity.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.580]   And so how can we keep the unity in our relationships and how can we?
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.340]   And what do you do because this is so difficult, right?
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.140]   Now today we are starting a new sermon here, it's called Forward Together.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.740]   And we in the season where we're in a season where we have the vision of what we call the
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.380]   uncharted vision.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.020]   So we shared it on Vision Sunday where we feel called out not to just stay here, but
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.300]   to go out and faith into the cities, into workplaces, into our families, into perhaps
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.420]   even other countries, wherever this may be.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:27.860]   And then we sense that as we go out that the spirit of God will move.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.920]   There will be these suddenly moments.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.420]   And then the question is, are we ready to respond immediately when the spirit is moving?
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.920]   And one thing that's important for that is, are we united as a family of faith when those
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.420]   suddenness come that we can immediately respond and move forward together into the purposes
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.580]   that God has for us.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.380]   And so this is the heart behind the season.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.000]   We as Pastor Ivan and I and others were praying, we felt this is something that spirit was
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.080]   putting on our hearts.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.020]   And so this is why we're focusing on it.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.140]   There is no, I'm not secretly addressing some specific conflict or disunity, I just also
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.420]   want to be clear about that.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.420]   But it is important.
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.060]   And so we're going to look at that.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.580]   And I also want to just say up front, I believe this message, even though I'm going to focus
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.060]   on church unity, I actually believe that what I'm going to talk about applies to unity and
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.140]   other areas in life as well.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.620]   So we're just going to come expectantly and see what God has for us here in this message.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.120]   Now, let me backtrack.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:49.840]   So one thing that we also see in scripture is that Jesus, he actually prays for the future
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.840]   church.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.800]   And that's in his high priestly prayer in John 17.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.960]   He prays that we're going to be unified, that we're going to be one.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.800]   And I want to just read this to you.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.360]   So I think it's already up there.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.400]   I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.560]   may be one.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.720]   Father, just as you are in me and I am in you, may they also be in us so that the world
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.600]   may believe that you have sent me.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:26.800]   Now, isn't this incredible that Jesus actually prays this prayer for the future church?
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.640]   And this is right before he goes to the cross, that this is the thing that is on his heart,
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:38.320]   is our unity, our oneness, which then also impacts our witness, that people know who
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.520]   Jesus is, that he truly is who we proclaim he is, and that is tied up with our unity
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.480]   and our oneness together.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.080]   And so if this is so important to Jesus and Jesus' heart for us, this needs to be on the
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.680]   top of our priority list.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.960]   And so let me take you to the passage that we're going to explore this with today.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.960]   And we're going to go to the book of Ephesians.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.760]   And Ephesians was one of Paul's letters.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:15.240]   And basically, the church in Ephesus was one of his church plants, people from different
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.480]   religious backgrounds, different cultural backgrounds.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.800]   They came to faith.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.440]   So these are new Christians from all sorts of diverse backgrounds.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.080]   And they are given, because of the work of Jesus, they are given a new identity and a
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.280]   new purpose.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.840]   And one of the questions or one of the things that Paul addresses in this letter is, A,
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.320]   he wants to clarify to them that identity, what Christ has done and what that means for
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.320]   their lives.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.860]   So he does that in chapters one all the way to chapter three.
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.480]   And then from chapter four to chapter six, he actually talks about how to live out that
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.120]   identity.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.640]   Like what does it mean that we are now part of the body of Christ?
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.520]   What does it mean to be a child of God?
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.240]   And what does it have to do with our everyday life?
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.680]   And he unpacks that there.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.720]   So let me take you to our passage.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.840]   We're right at that transition point where we shift from the focus being on what Christ
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.680]   has done for us to now what we should do in response.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:23.520]   So in chapter four, starting in verse one, it says this, "As a prisoner for the Lord,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.640]   and I urge you to live a life worthy of your calling, you have received.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.000]   Be completely humble and gentle.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.740]   Be patient, bearing with one another in love.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:39.200]   Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:44.240]   There is one body and one spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.400]   called one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and father of all who is over all and
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.560]   through all and in all."
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.560]   So here we see in verse one, there's this transition.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.600]   It says, "Then," which also means therefore, so it's referring to all that has happened
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.160]   beforehand, all the things that Christ has done.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.440]   So I actually want to give you a little summary of what Paul had been talking about.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.320]   So here it is.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.240]   The blessings in Christ.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.320]   God has blessed you with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.040]   You are adopted as his child.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.940]   He has redeemed you and forgiven you your sins.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.160]   He has given you the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.840]   He has saved you by grace, made you life in Christ and gave you a purpose.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.180]   He has made you part of the family of God, the body of Christ.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.200]   He has gave us as a church a mission and he gave you a relationship with God where you
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.880]   can come freely and confidently to your heavenly father.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.320]   You have access.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.080]   So these are the truths that Paul has been unpacking to them and more.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.360]   And so if you were to summarize it, we could say that God has called us to belong to him.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.740]   He has called us to be his holy people and he's called us to participate in his redemptive
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.420]   mission in this world.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.800]   So this is what Christ has done.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:21.400]   And so what does it mean though, as it says in verse one, to live a life worthy of our
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   calling?
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.840]   Like what does Paul actually mean by that?
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:32.880]   Well, one way we could respond to that question is we could say that living life worthy of
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:40.800]   the calling is our love response to what Christ has done in your life.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   God has blessed you in such incredible ways.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.200]   He has been so good to you.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.880]   And then us living a life worthy of our calling is responding to his incredible love, this
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.240]   incredible thing that Christ has done for us, this grace that he has shown us.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.440]   Now actually it was interesting that Benedict, we've been coordinators, that he earlier had
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:08.280]   a football stadium, a picture that he shared with us during the worship.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:16.240]   When I was a boy, I dreamed of being on the national German football team.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.720]   So in Germany, if you know, football is the biggest sport.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.280]   When I was young, Germany won World Cups and things.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.160]   And so I wanted to be on that team.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.760]   Now if I were to be called up, which there was no chance, but if I were to be called
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.200]   up to be on this football team, it would be an incredible blessing.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.560]   It would be an incredible privilege.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.520]   It would be such an honor to represent your country and to play in the stadium and to
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.440]   give your best.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.400]   But it also would be a responsibility to be on that team.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.760]   I have to carry and conduct myself a certain way because I'm representing my country.
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.080]   I have to practice hard.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.400]   And of course in the games, I have to give it my all.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.240]   I have to leave it all out on the field, as they say.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.280]   And so in a similar way, when we become a Christian, we're brought into the family of
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.040]   God.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:15.120]   And living a life worthy of our calling is now to represent this family.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.040]   And it's a blessing, but it's also a responsibility of how we carry out this calling in our everyday
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.200]   lives and our everyday moments, the mundane ones and the big ones.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   Do we bring honor to God with how I talk to my family back home and none of you are watching?
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.440]   Do I honor God when I interact with a guy that annoys me at work?
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.760]   Do I honor God when there's somebody in need and I actually have the time and the resources
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.480]   to do something about this person's need?
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.800]   And so this is what it means to live a life worthy of our calling.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.520]   It's an incredible blessing and we're responding.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.560]   We receive that and it's amazing, but there's also responsibility in that.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:03.280]   So I love that earlier, your picture of being in a stadium and celebrating God and then
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   going out and representing God with wearing our jersey.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:15.200]   So we get to wear our jersey, our Jesus jersey, in our everyday spheres of life.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.320]   But Paul here, at the beginning of this letter, he gets specific about what it means to live
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.320]   a life worthy of the calling.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.240]   There's actually a lot of things that he has to say about as you keep reading chapters
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:31.680]   four, all the way to chapter six, but the first thing that he talks about is unity.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.360]   Isn't that interesting that Paul, that's the first thing that he talks about when he
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.080]   talks about living a life worthy of our calling, that he talks about unity.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.120]   So let's look at verse three.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:49.600]   He says this, "Make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace."
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:55.000]   So he's encouraging us to do everything that we can do to be intentional, not just make
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.160]   some effort, make a little effort, make every effort to maintain that unity.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.000]   Now I've been already talking about unity and oneness and all these things, so I think
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.960]   it's actually important that I define a little bit what I mean, because probably right now
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.560]   we have different thoughts on this and what exactly that means.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.040]   So here's a little bit more detail on that.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.920]   The church is one because believers from diverse backgrounds have been united to Christ and
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.680]   to one another through faith in Jesus and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:38.000]   So God not only has reconciled us to himself, but he also brings reconciliation to each other.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.760]   But I want to unpack these things a little bit further.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:46.400]   So first, the unity of the church is not something that we create or that we bring about, but
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   it's something that we have because of the work that Christ has done.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.460]   Because he has reconciled us to himself and he has reconciled us to another.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.480]   So that's why it says, "Keep," because it's already there.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.240]   And we're meant to keep what God has already accomplished and done on our behalf.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.720]   We're meant to live in it.
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.360]   And when we do, it's good, because there's blessing in unity.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:16.520]   It creates an environment where we as a family can flourish and thrive and where what we
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.080]   do as a community together is effective.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.960]   So that's the first thing.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.960]   So it's not something we create, but it's something that God already has created and
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.720]   given us.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:37.260]   Now the second way is that unity does not mean homogeneity.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.260]   It does not mean uniformity.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:46.080]   So you've probably heard this before, that unity is not equal to uniformity.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.440]   So we're not all meant to be the same.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.080]   We're not all meant to come from the same socioeconomic background.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.400]   We're not all meant to be of the same ethnicity, the same gender, the same age range.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.000]   That's not what unity is about.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.840]   We're not all meant to have the same personalities.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.760]   So that's not what unity is.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.120]   The unity that the Holy Spirit brings does not erase our differences such as these cultural
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:16.720]   backgrounds, generational differences, and so forth, but rather uses those differences,
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.500]   our diversity, to build up the body of Christ.
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:27.560]   So every single person, whether you're a baby or a 90-year-old or somewhere in between,
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:33.040]   doesn't matter what cultural background you come from, doesn't matter what role you carry,
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:38.640]   doesn't matter what job you have, or all of that.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.160]   You have a role to play in the body of Christ.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.260]   God has a purpose for bringing you here because you are needed.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.900]   You have something to contribute, and you also in a unique way can image who God is
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.840]   to us so we can have a deeper and more full understanding of God.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.560]   So you are needed.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.880]   God has brought you here with a purpose for everyone.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:06.480]   He has a purpose, and it's in that diversity of giftings and of backgrounds that the body
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.560]   of Christ is richer and that we bring glory to God.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:21.280]   And third, unity does not mean absence of conflict.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.320]   Maybe it wasn't what we were expecting, right?
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.260]   That unity does not mean absence of conflict.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.720]   Think of a marriage.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.520]   You can have unity in a marriage, or you can have unity in a friendship, but you can have
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.880]   conflict, right?
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.060]   But it's really about how we handle our conflict.
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.480]   So I have a statement to that.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.720]   Unity is not the absence of conflict, but it has to do with how we work through those
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.900]   disagreements, how we handle our differences.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:54.440]   There are commitment to unity, and being one in the Spirit is displayed.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:19:00.320]   And so really, it's not about us always agreeing on everything.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:05.060]   It's not about us never having a conflict, but it's how we handle that and how we can
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:09.100]   move forward together that matters and that brings honor to God.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.800]   That we can work through our differences and even maybe agree to disagree on some things,
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.120]   but yet still be united and move forward together and bring honor to God.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.680]   And then finally, our unity, when we live it out, it reflects the loving unity between
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:30.600]   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:38.360]   And when we live out that unity as a local church, it really is a foretaste.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.760]   It really is a display of the power of the gospel.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.720]   Because the gospel is that Jesus died for us, that he rose, and that he has made us
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.800]   one family, that he forgives us, that he not only reconciled us to God, but he reconciled
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.800]   us to each other.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.360]   So when we live out that unity, we're actually testifying to the power of God to bring people
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.880]   together who usually don't hang out together in other contexts always, or who are a lot
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.640]   of times conflicted.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.240]   And so when we do that, it is so powerful.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:12.160]   And it says to a conflicted and a divided world, "Wow, there is something here at work.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.240]   There's something going on."
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.720]   And of course, we know what it is.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.720]   It is the power of the Spirit who has made us family.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.440]   And so that's why it's another reason it's so important for us to make every effort to
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.600]   keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.160]   That's why we need to do that.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.360]   It also brings God glory.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:39.160]   It's part of our witness.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.860]   So this is what we mean by unity, so I spent time unpacking that.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.040]   But this brings me back to our question earlier.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.600]   How can we keep the unity in our relationships when it's so difficult to do so?
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.520]   It's nice that we can agree on what unity is, but how do we actually do it?
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.640]   Because that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.360]   That's where the real life issues are.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.200]   And there's two things in this passage that I want to highlight, where one is a little
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.060]   bit more indirectly where Paul speaks to it, the other one he directly speaks to this.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:15.280]   So first, let's look at Ephesians 4 through 6.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.120]   Where Paul, he uses seven words that are preceded by one.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.640]   Let me read this to you again.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.920]   There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.920]   called one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.800]   through all and in all.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.520]   Now what's the significance of this?
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.100]   There's actually a lot, and so we could spend a lot of time here, but I just really want
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.960]   to boil it down to the most essential thing that this is saying.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:53.040]   And it's this, that there's only one gospel and to believe this gospel means that we enter
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.800]   into unity that it creates.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:03.640]   So if you believe this gospel, then for you, you are part of one body.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.200]   There's one Spirit and it's the same Holy Spirit working all of our lives.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   There's one hope.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.360]   There's not different Christian hope.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   There's one hope that we share.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.440]   There's one Lord, which is Jesus.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.560]   There's one faith and there's one baptism.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.720]   We're all baptized into Christ and there is one God and Father.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.000]   We don't have different spiritual fathers.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.420]   Our heavenly Father is all of our fathers, the Father.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:32.880]   And so the gospel, when we believe it, and we enter into this oneness that it creates,
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.160]   it's the result of the saving work, the redeeming work of Jesus.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:44.520]   And so unity flows from the gospel where unity is broken.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:55.080]   It reveals that we've drifted from the gospel, that we somehow have lost sight of the gospel.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:01.440]   And so the first thing that we can practically do if we want to keep the unity of the Spirit
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.200]   is we need to focus on the gospel.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:11.500]   We need to get back to focusing on the gospel because we somehow have lost track of Jesus
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.140]   and His saving work.
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:22.280]   So that means we meditate on that He died on the cross for our sins.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.200]   He forgives us that we don't have this.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:30.280]   We're not part of the body of Christ because we deserve it, but it's by His grace that
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.440]   we are part of this family.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   We don't deserve it.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:36.400]   It's undeserved grace, but we receive it.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.400]   It's a gift.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.400]   It's a blessing.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.280]   And so remind ourselves of some of these truths and remind ourselves of God's love, not just
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:46.240]   for ourselves, but for other people as well, because He didn't just die for you, even though
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.760]   He did also die for you, but He also died for the other person, maybe the one that we
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.160]   have the conflict with or that we're having this unity with.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.600]   And so how do we, again, but still, what do we practically do?
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.520]   Great, focus on the gospel.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:07.040]   Well, when I was leading a different church in a different context, I was in a leadership
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:15.680]   meeting and there was a person in this meeting who suddenly just criticized me and berated
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.800]   me.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.440]   And we're talking, it felt to me like 15 minutes, but it was like a five minute rant of how
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.800]   I was a bad pastor.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.040]   My preaching was bad.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.080]   My pastoral care was bad.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.480]   My, you know, everything I did was bad and sucked in this person's opinion.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:38.240]   And so I'm sitting there, I'm like, you know, like, and I have to say, I didn't manage to
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.200]   be completely undefensive.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.000]   So I don't feel like that anyone could, you know, in that moment.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.080]   So there was a little bit defensive, even though I did manage to keep a lot to myself
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:53.640]   and I'm just sitting there and it was so bad that other people started defending me, you
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.120]   know, because it was just so, it just was so hurtful.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.720]   And so then the meeting ended.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.640]   There was no way of moving forward in this meeting.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.160]   It just ended abruptly.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.880]   And I was like, first I was confused because it was actually a friend of mine.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.960]   So here's a friend ripping me into shreds in this meeting.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.720]   And so I was like, wow, you know, it's so hurtful.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.800]   Actually went home and cried.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:27.120]   And then after crying and being hurt and sitting in those feelings, I got angry.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.400]   I don't know if you guys ever have these imaginary conversations, dialogues, anyone?
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   Yes.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.400]   All right.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   Thank you all the time.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.240]   Well, I had those imaginary conversations and I'm so glad that you do not know what
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.880]   I said in those conversations because I was, you know, thinking about like, well, if it's
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.080]   so bad here, why are you here?
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.880]   You know, why don't you go to a different church?
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.920]   All of this stuff is playing in my mind.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   But I didn't like it.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.200]   You know, I knew that my heart was not right.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.360]   And it's not good.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.680]   It's not good to live in that mind space when you have these imaginary fictional conversations,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.280]   you know, about someone and you say what you're thinking.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.840]   And it's probably better never to say that in that moment.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:19.400]   And so one way that I got back on track was that I went back to the gospel.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.360]   I focused on the gospel.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.520]   And I did that through prayer.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.800]   You know, I asked Jesus to give me wisdom for what was going on.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.200]   And then as I'm praying, I was reminded of Jesus's, that I needed Jesus's grace, you
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.480]   know, just as much as the other person needed Jesus's grace.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:42.200]   And then suddenly I was led to pray for the person that had been very hurtful to me.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.600]   You know, and so when I prayed for the person, I prayed that God would bless this person.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.160]   And then I prayed over that God loves this person.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.160]   You know, and that's amazing.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.240]   And when we start praying, when we start applying the gospel to our lives, that we give this
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:05.520]   Holy Spirit room to work in us and to shift up, shift our perspective and to do something
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.720]   that we cannot do on our own strength.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.120]   And so I was able to, and this really was a process.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:17.600]   This was not a one-time prayer where we're talking like, I don't even remember how long
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.920]   it was long.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.720]   So, and then, but I got to the place where like, I reached out, I texted the person like,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.960]   "Hey, can we meet up and talk about what happened?"
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:34.240]   And so I went there and I did say like, "Hey, you know, you, you know how you communicated
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.800]   things and made it impossible to receive what you says, because it was just so harsh.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.960]   It was so harsh."
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.240]   Now after I had some time and had some time to think about it, there was some truth in
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.880]   some of the things that she was saying, but I was like, basically I was unable to receive
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.880]   that.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.280]   And then when I talked further, they also found out that actually something quite difficult
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.120]   had happened in this person's life.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.760]   Now that didn't excuse what this person did, right?
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:06.160]   But it did give me a context for, to be more compassionate and have more understanding.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:12.360]   And so we were able to forgive each other and we were able to move forward together.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:20.600]   But this is really not easy, but you know, to make every effort to keep the unity of
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.400]   the spirit through the bond of peace, you know, and this doesn't mean, and I also just
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.040]   want to say here, I want to clarify one thing.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:34.960]   This does not mean that, you know, when somebody is abusive, that we need to then go step back
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.460]   into this abusiveness or things, you know, but, but in most cases that's not the case.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:47.120]   And so there we are able to make every effort, you know, to forgive and to lean in and sort
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   of cutting off.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.080]   I wanted to cut off, you know, but it was not the right thing to do.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   And so that's the first thing.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:59.440]   When we, when there's conflict, when there's division and it comes up, we need to focus
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.600]   on the gospel and we need strength from outside of ourselves because we don't have the strength
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.000]   and God loves giving us the strength.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   So that's the first thing.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:18.880]   The second thing is we find in verse two, I've talked a lot, so I need to find the right
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   page.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880]   Here we go.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.040]   All right.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.320]   And so in verse two, it says this, be completely humble and gentle.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:32.160]   Be patient bearing with one another in love.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.720]   And here, what's, what's interesting is says also completely, you know, just don't be a
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:45.600]   little bit humble sometimes be completely humble, be completely humble and gentle and
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   patient.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:53.240]   So Paul, he calls Ephesians to embrace these characteristics.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.720]   And just think he's actually talking about living a life worthy of your calling.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.080]   Now when we think of living a life worthy of your calling, we probably don't think about
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.240]   embracing humility, gentleness, and patience.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.040]   Those are probably not the first things that come to mind.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.080]   We're probably thinking of doing something bold and courageous for God.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:16.560]   He's talking about a heart posture that we need.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.160]   And these are, you know, two of them are listed in the Galatians five, verse 22 and 23 as
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.000]   part of being part of the fruit of the spirit, but they're actually all three of them is
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.160]   the work of the spirit in our lives that brings forth these things that builds us into our
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.960]   hearts.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.300]   But I want to unpack them a little bit.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.920]   So the first quality is humility.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.360]   Now humility was actually looked down upon during Paul's time.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:47.080]   It was seen as shameful, was seen as weak.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.760]   And so it's, so it's amazing, you know, that Paul elevates this.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.400]   And the reason why he does this is because he sees that in Jesus, because Jesus humbled
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.800]   himself was king of all kings, who humbled himself, was born, you know, in human flesh,
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.960]   laid down his life on a cross, died.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:09.320]   And so he embraces this value that culture around him didn't embrace.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:17.960]   But if you understand God's grace, you know, his forgiveness in our lives, that we're broken
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.080]   people, that we're sinful people who need his forgiveness, who need his grace, that
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.200]   actually should bring humility to our lives.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.560]   You know, because we stand in this relationship with God in the first place, just by his grace,
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:35.480]   not because we're great people, but because God is great and because he loves us greatly.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.360]   So again, you know, it's going back to the gospel in some ways.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.120]   And when we focus on that, we understand that actually humility should characterize our
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.120]   lives.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.320]   So that's the first one.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.160]   The opposite of humility is pride.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   We walk in pride.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.040]   And I think we can see when we walk in pride that that leads to conflict and division,
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   right?
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.360]   Whereas humility allows us to work through our differences.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:04.600]   Well, the second and the third characteristics are gentleness and patience.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:11.580]   And again, when we look at God, he is so gentle and so patient with us.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.800]   Just think of your life.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:16.360]   Think of the dumb stuff we do.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.760]   Think of maybe how long we've been living lives even apart from Christ.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.140]   And yet he is patient with us to bring us into his family, to show us love, to forgive
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:32.040]   us yet that millions time again, when we mess up, when we do something stupid.
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.000]   And again, that's so characteristic of Christ.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.400]   He wants us to be gentle and he wants us to be patient with other people.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.800]   And the opposite of gentleness is harshness.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.940]   And the opposite of patience is impatience, of course.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:55.040]   So the second way that we keep the unity of the spirit is by embracing humility, gentleness,
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   and patience.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:03.600]   Now, going back to that story that I was telling, I was lacking all three of them.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   I didn't have the humility, I didn't have the gentleness, and I didn't have the patience
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   to begin with.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.520]   And I think if we're honest, a lot of times we would lack those things, especially in
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.360]   the heat of the moment, right?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.780]   Like they're not right there.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.340]   And so how do we embrace those characteristics?
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.200]   How can they become more part of our lives?
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.800]   Well, again, it was through prayer in this case, where we give the Holy Spirit room to
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.560]   do this work in our hearts so we can have those things, that we can carry those things
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.360]   into a conflict to keep things from escalating even further, and to bring this unity that
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.720]   honors God.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:48.980]   And so God really helped me through this time to move from pride to humility, where I really
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:53.200]   just wanted to cut off this person and tell them what I think with my imaginary conversations,
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:02.000]   where I wanted to speak harsh words to the person, to actually speak gently to the person.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.640]   And then where I was impatient, I was like, "That's it, we're done, leave."
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:20.860]   And He moved me towards patience, where I was willing to work through our differences.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:30.260]   So when we embrace these values, it really allows us to assume the best about other people,
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.060]   to deescalate, to move closer instead of moving further away.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:42.620]   And I want to invite the worship team to come up.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.400]   Jesus, He prayed for our unity.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.860]   His prayer, His heart's desire for us is that we are one.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:56.140]   You know, that we are one, that we are a family that is united and has unity with each other.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:00.320]   He deeply desires that for us, that is His prayer.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:07.620]   And He knows that is so critical for us, because when we are one, when there's oneness, we
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.180]   can thrive, we can grow in our faith, we can be a community that has fun.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.860]   Come on, if there's division, it's no fun.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.900]   We can be effective.
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.020]   What we do has kingdom impact.
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.580]   It's amazing.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.580]   Again, you can think of marriage.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.460]   If there's division in marriage, man, it is just draining.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.260]   Or when there's division in friendship, it's just draining.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:39.060]   But when there is unity, it creates an environment of flourishing, of thriving, of goodness.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:47.100]   And so God really wants us in all spheres of our lives to have unity, but especially
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:51.900]   also for us as a church family.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:57.060]   And so living a life worthy of our calling as we want to move out in the season into
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:04.540]   uncharted territory, as we want to love the city, we need to make every effort to have
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.960]   the unity of the Spirit.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.500]   And when we do, God's love flows through us as a community.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:17.660]   It touches your lives and it touches the lives of other people.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:22.980]   And God wants to touch lives through us.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:30.600]   And it would break my heart if we would stand in the way of that.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.260]   So we need to make every effort, but we're not on our own.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.060]   This is not making every effort is not out of our own strength.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:45.820]   It's the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, which gives us the grace, the strength, the motivation,
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:52.420]   the wisdom, and all of that we lack to move forward.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:59.340]   And so right now I want to invite you to reflect on this question you see up on the screen.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:05.900]   In what relationship do you need to move from pride to humility?
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.100]   From harshness to gentleness?
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:19.420]   From impatience to patience, and from a lack of love to love?
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.660]   And I want to invite you right now to just on your own to pray, to bring whatever is
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.700]   going on, whether in your marriage, whether in your friendships, whether in this church
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:36.940]   community, and just to open your heart to the work of the Spirit, to bring transformation,
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:42.060]   to bring change, to bring healing, to let His love flow.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:49.380]   So I'm just going to give a couple of minutes to do that, and then I'm going to come back
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.380]   and pray over us.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.380]   So let's pray right now.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.140]   Let's do this.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:38:02.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
