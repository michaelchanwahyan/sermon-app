1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Welcome to the Vine. It is so good to be together, amen? So good to have you here

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,480
 today. Today is Vision Sunday part two. We are so glad you're with us, whether

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,200
 online or in the room. It's Vision Sunday. You know it's Vision Sunday because I'm

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,840
 wearing my jacket. I don't wear it even on Easter. Don't wear it on Christmas Day.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,520
 Vision Sunday, I put my jacket on just for you so you know that I'm serious

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,320
 about Jesus on Vision Sunday. If you're new to the Vine, we're so glad you're

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,640
 here. My name is Andrew. I'm one of the pastors and if this is your first time

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,960
 with us, we want to just welcome you. Maybe you just put your hand up and wave

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,840
 it at me. You're just saying, "Hey, I'm new." You just wanted to say, "Hi." Hey there,

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
 nice to meet you. Welcome. It's great to have you with us. Anyone else new in the

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,040
 Upper House as well? Yep, I see the hand over there too. Welcome in the Upper House

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,680
 as well. We are so grateful. We have new people every week. It always blows us

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,800
 away and we want to make sure that you feel welcomed, loved, at home, comfortable

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,320
 with us. We're crazy but normal at the same time. That's the beautiful

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,320
 thing. Right after the service, we have a Connect Hub. It's our way to connect with

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,440
 you if you're new. You can just go out the doors here on the second floor.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,760
 There'll be a team of people led by Jennifer and a bunch of other incredible

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,520
 volunteers and leaders. They're gonna be outside after the service. They would love

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,160
 to say hi, tell you a little bit more about the church, maybe just help you to

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,560
 get connected. So if you're in the Upper House after the service, just come down

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
 to the second floor. If you're here in the Lower House, you just walk straight

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,560
 out. And online, if you are new as well, we want to connect with you. Chapman and

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,000
 his incredible team are online right now, typing furiously as I speak to welcome

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,080
 and love on you. And we'd love to get to know any new people that are joining us

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,560
 online together today as well. It is so good to have you here. We've been saying

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,960
 so much that this is about serving. We're in a season of serving here at the Vine.

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,840
 We do need volunteers. You know, we've reopened. This is our fourth Sunday that

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,160
 we've reopened. You didn't have to register to come to church today. Can I

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,120
 have an amen? We are so grateful that you guys have been registering. You didn't

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,720
 need to register today. You're here in person. Wonderful. If you are, obviously

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,120
 the vaccine pass is unfortunately still needed to be able to come into physical

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,720
 gatherings. But of course, for those of you watching online, that's available for

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,280
 absolutely anyone. And we need volunteers to make this thing happen, both online

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,320
 and in person. And so that is so important. You know that we need about

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,520
 90 people throughout the day. And if we did not have volunteers working right

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,600
 here, right now, the mic would not be working. None of these lights would be on.

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,120
 No one would have been downstairs to welcome you and check you in. Literally,

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,200
 this place. I'd be like, like, that's how much we need our volunteers. This whole

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,880
 thing that you see happen on a Sunday, that to be honest, we all do take for

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,080
 granted when we come in here. It happens not because of our staff. It happens

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,720
 largely because of volunteers. And so we need you. We love you. Volunteering is a

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,320
 great way to get connected at a church like the Vine. So you can find out more

43
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,920
 by scanning that QR code or going to our website, checking out Serve. We're so

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,600
 grateful for that. Also, you may know that a church like the Vine only really runs

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,240
 well when it is run by a dedicated group of volunteer leaders that we call elders.

46
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,760
 We have an eldership here at the Vine that is our ultimate governance of the

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,760
 church. It's the thing that is the ultimate spiritual oversight. They are my

48
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,720
 collective bosses and I love them dearly. And we're always trying to grow our

49
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,000
 eldership with capable men and women from within the Vine congregation. And

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,320
 I'm really excited today to announce to you that we have a candidate that we

51
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,640
 want to put forward to you. This is Sky Sue, her husband Derek. That's their son

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,440
 Elliot. And it's Elliot that's standing for...no, just kidding. It's Sky. Sky is

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,280
 standing for eldership and we are so excited about that. We actually discerned

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,800
 about a year ago that we wanted Sky to be on our eldership. And so I approached

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,880
 Sky for a coffee and she was also excited about it. But she was like, "But

56
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,040
 I'm pregnant and I'd like to have my kid first." I'm like, "Yes, family first." So

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,920
 she's had her child. Elliot's now about nine months old. And so we're now

58
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,320
 bringing Sky to you guys. Now at the Vine we have people that come every week. If

59
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,960
 you come here every week, you are a part of our family. You're a part of our

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,920
 congregation and community. We love you. But we also have members of the church.

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,000
 Members are people who have formally aligned themselves to the Vine. You've

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,840
 filled in a little form that says that you want to be a member here at the

63
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,280
 church. It is our members that vote for eldership. It's not decided by me or the

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,520
 senior team or even the elders themselves. It's decided by you guys.

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,240
 That's the beauty of the governance structure that we have at the Vine. And

66
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,960
 so there are two opportunities if you're a member here at the Vine to get to know

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,280
 Sky and then also to vote. The first is our Zoom event on the May 24th. That's

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,560
 where you will get to know and meet Sky. Perhaps some of you don't know Sky. Sky

69
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,320
 has actually been at the Vine since 2005. She met Derek here at the Vine. They got

70
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,640
 married here at the Vine. They just had their baby at the Vine. Literally they

71
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,080
 gave birth. No, they didn't. Actually it was a hospital. But they're committed, okay.

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
 But you may want to get to know them, get to know a bit of their story.

73
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,520
 So May 24th. It says 7 o'clock on the slide. It's actually 8 o'clock that we'll

74
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,200
 be doing that Zoom. We'll send you an email this week that will give you the

75
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,880
 details about that. That's your chance to log in, hear a bit of Sky's story, ask her

76
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,920
 some questions so you can prepare your heart. And then on June 12th is when we'll

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,240
 gather to vote. We're having an extraordinary general meeting in EGM.

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,680
 It's gonna be at 1245 on Sunday June 12th. It'll be both in person and online.

79
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,960
 And voting will take place in both, both in person and online. So however you can

80
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,920
 join us, if you're a member of this church, I want to encourage you to put it

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,780
 in your diary and come be prepared to vote on that day either again in person

82
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,520
 or online. And we'll again get you all those details in the coming few weeks to

83
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,600
 get you prepared for the EGM. Does that sound good? All right, great. We're excited

84
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,000
 about that. And you know when we have good governance, that is such an

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,400
 important thing in our time of history right now. And so I'm very grateful that

86
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,080
 Sky is putting herself forward for that. All right, well today as I've already

87
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,040
 said is a very special Sunday. This is Vision Sunday Part 2. If you...we normally

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,560
 only do one Vision Sunday a year. This year, because 2022 is so so special, we're

89
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,600
 doing two Vision Sundays. So we already had Vision Sunday Part 1 back at the end

90
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,820
 of March. And that's when we announced to you all the really exciting news that we

91
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,640
 are church planting. That we're moving into a season now at the Vine where we're

92
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,560
 going to plant some churches. And actually the heart of church planting,

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,680
 the desire to do that, has been something that we've carried as a church for many

94
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,320
 many years. In fact, before I became senior pastor here in 2013, a couple of

95
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,200
 years before that, I actually sat down with John and Tony and we talked about

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,600
 what is the future of the Vine going to look like. And I was preparing my heart and

97
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,840
 myself for leadership here. And we talked about church planting. We're like, we're

98
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,240
 going to be a church in the future in multiple locations. And we had that dream

99
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,440
 all the way back then. In 2016, we actually formed a church planting search

100
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,400
 committee because we believe that God was going to launch us into church

101
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,360
 planting back then. And for almost a year, I met with a bunch of people from staff

102
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,800
 and from the congregation. We prayed, we thought, we came up with some good ideas.

103
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,200
 But they were good ideas and not God ideas. And we realized that although the

104
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,800
 desire was good and healthy, the timing just didn't feel right. And we wrestled

105
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,120
 with that a little bit. But we submitted to the fact that the Spirit of God

106
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,340
 wasn't releasing us into what it is that we're holding in our hearts. I was

107
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,160
 actually reminded during that season of Proverbs 16 verse 9, where it says that

108
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,400
 people prepare vision and get desires in their hearts, but it is God that

109
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,120
 determines their steps. And we knew that God had given us this vision of church

110
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:54,280
 planting, but he hadn't yet released our steps. Well, in 2019, God began to move. In

111
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,960
 2019, he gave us a new vision. It was the river vision, a new way of thinking about

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,760
 church, a new way of seeing church, not as one physical location, but church like

113
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,160
 now a river, like a river that could spread out across a whole city and

114
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,840
 nation, taking the water of the gospel to the needy people out there. And we talked

115
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
 about how church looks like that now. It's us in our spheres of influence

116
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,800
 being the body of Christ wherever it is that he has planted us. And then God gave

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,520
 us a political and social unrest to show us what I think the deeper issues of

118
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,520
 society were like here in Hong Kong, to help us to understand some of the

119
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,080
 challenges and the brokenness that is here in our city, to break our hearts

120
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,280
 once again for the people of Hong Kong, to help us to forge a new path as we

121
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,760
 thought about reconciliation and grace and truth and justice and what does that

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,320
 really mean for the vine. And then God gave us a pandemic, which taught us very

123
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,500
 strongly that church is not 90 minutes on a Sunday, that actually church isn't

124
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,240
 about gathering together in a room on a Sunday, that church actually can take

125
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,200
 place and needs to take place in multiple places around Hong Kong. And we

126
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,840
 saw it in homes, didn't we? The home became recaptured as a sacred space, a

127
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,680
 place for church on Sundays. We saw it in cafes, in the ways that people met.

128
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,880
 We saw actually that we can't just rely on 90 minutes on a Sunday, we have to

129
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,840
 rely on our own spiritual disciplines that we're putting into place in our

130
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,000
 lives to strengthen our faith in Christ, not just to be strengthened by the

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,120
 pastor in a church on a Sunday, but we take responsibility for that as we grow

132
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,600
 in our faith. And then as we began to wrestle with what God was doing through

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,760
 that, God then gave me two incredible emerging leaders. One of them is this

134
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,520
 larger-than-life big German guy, right? And he's a big guy, but he's like

135
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,560
 the softest guy you've probably ever met, and he has a beautiful heart for people,

136
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,840
 and his heart is broken for people, and he loves community and loves the gospel

137
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,800
 and wants to share the gospel. He's a man who's gone on his own healing journey

138
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,760
 and is so beautifully soft coming out the back of that. And God gave us also

139
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,320
 this other leader, a chiseled, good-looking, young Chinese guy that

140
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,440
 like stands on stage and everybody's like, "Wow!" The guys are like, "I wish I was him!"

141
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,840
 And he has a passion for the gospel, a passion for the people of Hong Kong, for

142
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,360
 these people, for the people of our city in this time, and I saw their gift and

143
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,080
 I saw what was in their heart, and I knew that God was beginning to direct our

144
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,040
 steps. And then I saw you guys. I saw a church that remained faithful to the

145
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,400
 vine over three crazy years, a church that has now emerged, and you guys, I just

146
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,800
 want to say, well done. You've gone through three of the hardest...everybody

147
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,680
 else in the world has just gone through two hard years. You've gone through three

148
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,680
 hard years, okay? And it's totally changed our lives, and you have survived, okay?

149
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,800
 You are here still, and guess what? Here's what I know about us. We come out of

150
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,260
 those three years stronger, more faithful, more committed, more excited for Hong

151
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,000
 Kong than we've ever been. No, those three years are not gonna hold us back. In fact,

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,160
 we're gonna double down on this city like never before, amen? Like we are

153
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,880
 emerging out of these three years stronger, more excited, and more ably, I

154
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,360
 think, prepared for the gospel and to give the gospel than ever before. So I

155
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,120
 stand back from all of that. I see all the things that have happened in these

156
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,120
 last three years. I see these two incredible leaders that God is raising

157
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,480
 up, and I can tell that, yeah, long ago, He planted the desire in our hearts, but

158
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,280
 now He is directing our steps. Now it is time for us to release what it is that

159
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,800
 we're going to be releasing today. One of the scriptures that has sat over us as

160
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,160
 we've wrestled with this vision of the river is from Ezekiel 47. I want to very

161
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,140
 quickly just read this to you to help set some of the things that we're

162
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,920
 talking today about from scripture. This is Ezekiel 47, starting in verse 6.

163
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,960
 Ezekiel's writing this, "Then he," talking about this angel in a vision, "led me

164
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,760
 back to the bank of the river. When I arrived there, I saw a great number of

165
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,080
 trees on each side of the river. He said this to me, 'This water flows towards the

166
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,760
 eastern region and goes down into the Araba, where it enters the sea.'" By that,

167
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,880
 they mean the Dead Sea. "When it empties into the sea, the water there becomes

168
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,960
 fresh. Swarms of living creatures will live there wherever the river flows.

169
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,400
 There will be large numbers of fish because this water flows there and makes

170
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,000
 the salt water fresh. So where the river flows, everything will live. Fishermen and

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,400
 fisherwomen, fisher people, let's just say fisher people, okay? Fisher

172
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,040
 people will stand along the shore from En-Gede to En-Geleam, and there will be

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,320
 places for the spreading of nets. The fish will be of many kinds, like the fish

174
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,640
 of the great sea." Ezekiel was standing there. He sees this river flowing from

175
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,560
 the center of the temple. The river symbolizes the Spirit and the power of

176
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,840
 God, and he sees in his vision this river flow east. That's us, by the way. Flow east,

177
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,360
 right? Into the Dead Sea, and I love this. Notice this. It says, "It'll turn the salt

178
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,040
 water fresh." So that the salty things, the broken things. I don't know if you've

179
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,600
 ever been to the Dead Sea. I was in the Dead Sea last year. I got to float on the

180
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,120
 Dead Sea. That classic photo that everybody sees of the newspaper thing,

181
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,880
 right? It's a soup. It is the most uncomfortable, awful, stinkiest thing

182
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,880
 you've ever been in, right? And in this vision, Ezekiel sees the Dead Sea, the

183
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,160
 saltiest body of water in the world, and he sees it turning fresh because of the

184
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,360
 river of God. And we know that as God is sending us out with church planting, this

185
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,500
 is what he's sending us out with, a passion to see the broken and the hurting

186
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,120
 and the loss go from a salty life to a fresh life in Christ Jesus, to a renewed

187
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,800
 life. The kind of life where Jesus says, "If you are in Christ Jesus, you are a new

188
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,240
 creation. The old is gone. The saltiness is no more. You are fresh. There's a new

189
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,120
 life in you." And Ezekiel sees this new life, and he's excited about it. And as we

190
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,360
 church plant, it's because God is calling us to be a church that will see some

191
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,920
 salty people become fresh again. Amen? There's healing and restoration that's

192
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,080
 needed in our city. Will we go and be a church that, by the grace of God, can heal

193
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,080
 and restore and see the salty become fresh? That's the first thing. Here's the

194
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,400
 second thing. It says there will be many fish in this river. Can you imagine it?

195
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,080
 Thousands of fish there. So, so many fish. And this reminds us that church planting

196
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,560
 is not about growing a brand. It's not about making the vine more. It's not

197
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,120
 about anything like that. It's about the people, the people, the people. It's about

198
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,440
 reaching out to the fish that are out there. Hong Kong is 90% non-Christian.

199
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,360
 After, I don't know how many years of faithful Christian service here in our

200
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,080
 city, still 90% of our people in this city do not know Jesus. There are a lot

201
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,920
 of fish. And Ezekiel sees this picture of lots and lots of fish, and he says, "The

202
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,600
 time has to be now." Not only that, but it says this, that there are lots of

203
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,200
 different kinds of fish. I love that. I love that Ezekiel didn't just see one

204
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,600
 type of fish. He saw lots of different diversities of different kinds of fish.

205
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,320
 And this reminds us that our church planning must be about reaching multiple

206
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,960
 cultures, multi-ethnic people. That it's not just about one type of people. We're

207
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,400
 not just going out to to try to save international people or English-speaking

208
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,000
 people. We have to go out and say, "No, this is about the local Chinese. This is

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
 about the mainland Chinese. This is about the ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. This

210
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,720
 is about the asylum seekers and refugees. It is about those who are foreigners in

211
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,220
 this land, as well as those that have lived here all their lives. We got to go

212
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,440
 out and embrace the diversity of Hong Kong and be a church that's fit for

213
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,160
 purpose for that diversity." Which is why back in March, in Vision Sunday Part 1, we

214
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,800
 actually told you that the church plant we're going to be doing is going to be

215
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,640
 in both English and it's going to have a service purely in Cantonese. And I

216
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,760
 believe in the future at some point, we're going to have church plants that

217
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,760
 will have services in Mandarin. Because we believe strongly that there are

218
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,680
 multiple kinds of fish in Hong Kong. That's a beautiful thing about Hong Kong.

219
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,440
 And surely we have to be a church that serves not just one kind of fish, but the

220
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,200
 fishes that God is giving to this city. So when we see that vision from Ezekiel,

221
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,120
 and we hold that vision in our hearts, here's the question we ask ourselves.

222
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,320
 Where in Hong Kong can we find a place that, because of recent events, really

223
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,140
 needs some healing and restoration? Some salty water becoming fresh? Where in

224
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,280
 Hong Kong can we find a place that is a large place, that has a large amount of

225
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,000
 people, lots of fish there for us to fish within that pond? And where in Hong Kong

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,400
 can we find a place that actually, within the largeness of it, it's not just

227
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,360
 mono-ethnic, but multi-ethnic, that has a lot of different expressions within that

228
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:03,880
 one place? Where in Hong Kong is it? Well, we found it. And we're now going to tell

229
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
 you all about it. In fact, I'm not going to tell you much about it at all. The two

230
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,640
 incredible leaders that we're sending out to this place will tell you all

231
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,280
 about it. Tim and Ivan. And first of all, they're going to introduce you to this

232
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,920
 place by video. Let's check this out.

233
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,000
 Hey Church, after months of research, prayer, conversations with the senior

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,680
 leadership, we have landed on a church-planned location. Ladies and

235
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,400
 gentlemen, Yuen Long.

236
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:40,320
 Yuen Long? You must be saying, "Where?" Well, Yuen Long is a town situated in the

237
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,720
 western New Territories. It is a district that covers over 135 square kilometers

238
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,520
 and has a population close to 700,000 people. Yuen Long is a home to thousands

239
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,600
 and a place bursting with a new life and energy. The people that live in Yuen Long

240
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 are from a wide range of backgrounds and cultures. Yuen Long was traditionally a

241
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,640
 market town where people from surrounding villages sold their crops

242
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,920
 and fish. The market continues to be a main focal point of the town today and

243
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,080
 people from all over the western New Territories gather here to trade, do

244
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,480
 business, and help community. Yuen Long has that beautiful small-town feel to it

245
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,320
 despite its rapid growth and development in the past 15 years. Yuen Long has grown

246
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,840
 from a little small market town through the development of Yuen Long New Town in

247
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,640
 the 1970s, then the development of Tin Shui Wei New Town in the 1980s into an

248
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,360
 up-and-coming urban center. Many people live in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island

249
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,880
 have relocated to Yuen Long because of its residential and transportation

250
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:02,240
 development. More recently, Yuen Long has grown in its ethnic minority population

251
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,560
 and now houses one of the largest asylum seekers and refugees populations

252
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:13,640
 outside of southern Kowloon. It is also strategically situated next to

253
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,000
 Shenzhen and has one of the busiest cross-border ports in Hong Kong. Because

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,840
 of this, Yuen Long has recently grown with mainland Chinese and will continue to do

255
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,240
 so into the future. While traditional Chinese spirituality dominates the city,

256
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,280
 the local Chinese Church has a long history in the district and a number of

257
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,520
 Cantonese and Mandarin fellowships are well known in the area. However, with the

258
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,220
 growing ethnically diverse population in the city, there is a real need for an

259
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,200
 established English-speaking church in the area. Moreover, the de-churched

260
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,600
 population and the growing educated middle class gives plenty of

261
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,360
 opportunity for contemporary Vine-style church to reach out in Cantonese in new

262
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:14,000
 and effective ways. We also see a great opportunity for healing and restoration

263
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,960
 in this area. You may remember Yuen Long being in the news during the social

264
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,720
 unrest movement for the attack that happened in Yuen Long MTL station.

265
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,360
 Spiritually, we see an important opportunity for the gospel in this time

266
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,120
 and the focus the Vine has in restoration, justice and reconciliation

267
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,400
 will be well suit to this area. There is so much more we could show you about

268
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,560
 Yuen Long, but for now we hope this little introduction has given you a real

269
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,920
 sense of why we are so excited to plant a new Vine Church in the heart of this

270
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,600
 town. Yuen Long has a long and important history in Hong Kong and its strategic

271
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,280
 location means it will be one of the most important district for the city

272
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,360
 moving forward. It is this future we are really excited about. We want to invite

273
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,400
 you to be praying for us as a church as we plan, prepare and launch a church in

274
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,680
 this place and we can't wait to keep you updated and to tell you more over the

275
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,280
 coming months.

276
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:35,080
 So excited! As the video just showed, Yuen Long is a location that the Holy Spirit

277
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,800
 leading us to plant a church. Its larger urban area has good assets to public

278
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,120
 transport. The demographics include English and Cantonese speakers, also

279
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,000
 refugees and asylum seekers. To its east of the Yuen Long, there have come ten. To

280
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,120
 its south, Sapa Hong. To its west, Hong Sui Kio. A lot of refugees and asylum seekers

281
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:09,920
 living in those village areas. Near Hong Sui Kio is Tin Soi Rai, right? You can see

282
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,480
 that you have 300,000 people living including local Hong Kongers, also

283
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,960
 immigrants from mainland China. Around the northern east area, they have thousands

284
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,400
 and thousands low-rise residential estate that many foreigners, young

285
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:34,320
 families, also middle-class living. In the northern part of Yuen Long, there are

286
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,520
 few cross-borders connection with the mainland China. You also can see the

287
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:49,520
 buildings in Sam Cheung from Yuen Long. All of this area are part of Yuen Long and now

288
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,880
 we are going to plant a church in the center of Yuen Long to share the gospel to

289
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,400
 the people, to invite them to follow Jesus and to serve the local community

290
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,240
 with love in Christ. Let me share a little bit about myself with Yuen Long

291
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,640
 this place. Bok Oi Hospital, the only hospital in Yuen Long before there are

292
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,240
 new one in Tin Soi Rai, that's where I was born. For some reasons, my family

293
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,660
 moved many, many times when I was young just around Yuen Long. So I used to be

294
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:31,400
 living in many different areas in Yuen Long. I have studied in four different

295
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,400
 secondary schools, from the one with the best reputation in town to the one with

296
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:45,000
 the worst. So I don't, I think you don't want to be like me now. And I was a lifeguard

297
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,200
 in Yuen Long Public Swimming Pool. Also I was a fireman on duty in Yuen Long Fire

298
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:59,040
 Station. What I mean is I know this place and I love this place as my home and I

299
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:07,880
 also can see that God love his people in this place. But I need to clarify, I need

300
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,640
 to want to make sure that you know, understand and hear that this is not the

301
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,500
 reason we plant a church in Yuen Long, not just because where I live. But of course

302
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,000
 the local knowledge of the areas is helpful for us, for Tim, myself and the

303
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,600
 wider leadership continue to discern how we best serve the local community in

304
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:36,340
 Yuen Long. I saw how this place has been developed from a very little town to one

305
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:42,040
 of the largest towns in Hong Kong. I experienced the beauty of this place,

306
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:57,240
 Yuen Long, as a diverse and homogenous community. But since on 21st July in 2019,

307
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:05,840
 I saw from my balcony in my home, by my own eyes, how 200 something white t-shirt

308
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:13,840
 people interact with a few black t-shirt people. The day after, the whole town

309
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:22,240
 completely became deafening silent because people were filled by fear. Do

310
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,440
 you remember that? Of course, after that there are unrest, social movement and

311
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:39,200
 conflict. In the past few years, I see how many of my friends, my families, my old

312
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:48,880
 classmates, my friends who are protest, my friends who are police and civil servants,

313
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:58,080
 many of them experienced the brokenness, the grievous division. Many of their

314
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,440
 hearts were broken because their relationship were broken with their

315
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,520
 beloved family and friends. But I have seen how Yuen Long, this place, in a faith

316
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,500
 community like us, to bring gospel, to bring hope, healing and restoration to

317
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,280
 the people, they are broken and divided. Church, like last week, Pastor Andrew

318
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:28,200
 reminded us, we are the children of God on this world. Our hope is to move into

319
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,480
 Yuen Long to share the gospel, to reach out to the people, not just plant a

320
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,040
 church, but use the church as a equipping center for people in and around Yuen Long

321
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,600
 and also surrounding area, bringing the gospel to the people who are divided and

322
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:52,200
 broken. The people in this place are thirsty and they need the water of the

323
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:03,040
 river. What can we do is just act by faith. Let us just go out, serve, give and really

324
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,640
 bring the love that we come from Jesus upon us. As the children of God, at the

325
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,840
 water of the river, take action to give and just serve. Like what God asked

326
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:25,480
 Ezekiel in chapter 47 verse 6. Today is asking us the same. Son of man, can you

327
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:36,560
 see this? I really hope that. Our answer is, yes Lord, I can see and we will serve,

328
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,320
 surrender and commit.

329
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:56,080
 I'm the big guy, right? He's a good-looking guy right there. Yeah, so as

330
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,200
 Ivan, thanks Ivan, as Ivan has shared, we are really excited to plant this

331
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,680
 church in Yuen Long. And I remember when I first came to Hong Kong, this by the way

332
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,440
 is my second time around here, it was in 2008 and I had friends that lived out in

333
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,800
 Yuen Long. So I went out there several times and it really is amazing how much

334
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:20,240
 Yuen Long has grown and changed. And it is this dynamic place that does draw

335
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,520
 people from that whole area together and it's that community center. And so we're

336
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,720
 really excited about that. We're also excited about the people with

337
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,400
 different backgrounds that live in that area, from different socio-economic

338
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,200
 backgrounds, different generations and also different cultural backgrounds. And

339
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:48,760
 we believe that as a Vine Church family, that we are uniquely positioned to, with

340
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:55,440
 our DNA, with our culture, to serve the people in Yuen Long and to reach out to

341
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,840
 people there and to love them. And there are not a lot of churches like the Vine

342
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:10,040
 in Yuen Long. With our charismatic worship, our emphasis on social justice and

343
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:17,720
 mercy and also a desire to just love and serve the refugee and asylum seeker

344
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,960
 community. And then also we're very intentional about being multi-ethnic in

345
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,200
 a socio-economic diverse community. And so therefore we believe that there is a

346
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,440
 need for a church like the Vine in Yuen Long. Now one of the unique strengths of

347
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:41,040
 the Vine has been that we are a place of healing and restoration. And I myself

348
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:49,640
 have experienced that here at the Vine. And as Ivan was sharing, you know, Yuen

349
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,760
 Long during the period of social unrest, not by its own choice, but it has become

350
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:03,280
 a symbol of the division of people in Hong Kong. And our heart is, since we have

351
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:09,880
 that DNA of healing and restoration, to make a contribution to that healing of

352
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,920
 that division of those broken relationships. And it was interesting as

353
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,640
 we were talking with people that are exploring being part of the launch team,

354
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,240
 this team has come up multiple times, that they shared we would love to see

355
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,840
 healing of this division. And so we sense that this is something the Holy Spirit

356
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,520
 is sowing into God's people's heart and leading us to be peacemakers as

357
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,920
 Pastor Andrew shared last week in doing that hard work. We know it's hard work,

358
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:49,620
 but we can do it by God's grace and by the power of the Holy Spirit. Now to

359
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,360
 Yuen Long is also exciting for other reasons, because it gives incredible

360
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,560
 opportunities to partner with branches of hope and serving marginalized

361
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,400
 communities. We've also talked with Oasis, which is our counseling and psychotherapy

362
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,560
 center, and they are totally open and willing to collaborate to serve people

363
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,320
 in terms of the areas of mental, emotional, spiritual, and relational

364
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,640
 health. And so we're really excited about these collaborations and fleshing

365
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,160
 out further what they can look like. And one word that we got also about this

366
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:29,240
 church plant was the word "collaborate." And so we believe there will also be

367
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,680
 other collaborations that we're going to engage in, and so we're super

368
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,440
 excited about that. Now one of the things that convinced me personally that God is

369
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,280
 leading us to plant a church in Yuen Long is its sense of community. Now as we

370
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,920
 were exploring different, more central locations in Kowloon, so we did look at

371
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,880
 several of them, as we were talking about that and discerning if we were to

372
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,600
 plant a church there, we had the sense that it would be a commuting center and

373
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:12,560
 not so much centered around community. But our heart is, you know, our heart is

374
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,240
 to really to not just be a place that focuses on filling a venue on a Sunday

375
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,960
 morning, as important as that is, but our heart is to be a 24/7 type of church

376
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,520
 that is involved in the community, immersed in it locally, and that is

377
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,520
 focused on the specific geographical location and people that live there.

378
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,720
 And so that's what resonated deeply in our hearts. Our goal is not

379
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,360
 simply to fill a church on a Sunday, but it is to be immersed and to reach out

380
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:52,080
 and to reach people wherever they're at and whoever they are. So with Yuen Long

381
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,160
 being less of a central commuting place and more of a community, we believe that

382
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,600
 that allows us to carry out that vision in that heart. And so we are super

383
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,560
 excited about that. Now, as I was sharing about this, we're in the middle of

384
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,080
 processing this, I was talking to Tiffany, who is exploring being part of the

385
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,320
 Church Plant Launch Team, and she shared this quote from the movie Fantastic

386
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,800
 Beasts. She's like, "Do what's right, not what's easy." And I was like, "Yes, that's

387
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,840
 exactly it." You know, we're called to do what's right, not what's easy. And

388
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,840
 immersing ourselves in the local community and doing outreach and

389
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,320
 evangelism, you know, that's not easy. That's actually difficult work. It means

390
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,200
 getting our hands and our feet dirty. But it is the work that bears the fruit, and

391
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,160
 that's what we feel called to do, and that's what we want to engage in.

392
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:58,040
 So, as Ivan and I have been sharing, this is where we have discerned, this is a

393
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,800
 place where God is leading us, is leading us to make this kingdom investment, to

394
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,640
 share the gospel. And so we are really excited about that. And now, I want to

395
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,800
 hand it back to Ivan.

396
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,920
 So now, we are going to share our timeline on Church Plant. On 24th May, we

397
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,680
 will have our very first launch team meeting in person in Vindy Hall. Come on,

398
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,320
 can I have more excitement about that? We can face to face with the mask, of course,

399
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,960
 but yeah, it's a very good opportunity for us to get to know each other, to know

400
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,440
 more about you and also ourselves, and also the Church Plant. We strongly believe

401
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,360
 that God is raising up a team to step up and step out to the Church Plant.

402
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:56,040
 Since, here is the QR code, so you may just scan it now, take a picture, or you

403
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,480
 can go to our webpage, findchurch.life/plant to have more

404
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,720
 Church Plant information. Since August, we will start meeting regularly as a

405
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,440
 launch team and also core team to learn and to be equipped to build a family of

406
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:22,280
 God together. On 7th June, we will have Churchwide Payer Meeting. We are looking

407
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,480
 forward to worship together, to pray for the Church Plant, all together with you

408
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:34,320
 in here, the auditorium, and also online. In September, we will secure the venue.

409
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:42,080
 We pray that God will lead us to secure the venue in His timing, so that we

410
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,400
 will see when we will have the official launch, also the soft launch. We hope that

411
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:56,800
 we will have soft launch, launch English and also Cantonese service by

412
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:06,480
 March 2023 and also official launch by April. But before we really launch

413
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,080
 the service, the Church, we will already form our community group and also one

414
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,760
 link service. We target to start from October this year, so that we can keep

415
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,640
 the momentum going well towards the Church Plant. I know that many of you

416
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,080
 have passion with those different area, so please, just join us, have joy and

417
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,480
 excited, go forward to the Church Plant.

418
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:44,800
 - Thanks, Ivan. So I get to share with you the budget that we have come up with,

419
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,760
 the one-year operating expenses for this Church Plant. I do want to just make

420
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,520
 clear, these numbers are not based on a specific venue, but as our best estimate

421
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,680
 and some research on some venues, on multiple venues. And so that's how we

422
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,080
 have come up with these numbers at this point in time. So what you see here is a

423
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:11,760
 one-year operation expenses of 5.8 million, and we do have a more detailed

424
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,320
 budget, a three-year budget with a lot more budget item lines. And so if that's

425
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,160
 something that you're interested in looking at, reach out to me and I would

426
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,120
 love to chat with you about that more. And so what we're aiming to do today is

427
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,280
 to raise those 5.8 million, but you can also see that there is a setup, an

428
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,960
 initial setup investment and cost. And what that entails is, you know,

429
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,280
 operations is just running things for that one year, but actually getting it

430
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,320
 set up and ready probably will entail renovation and getting the room fitted

431
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,840
 out for the ministries and for the community outreach. And so that's what

432
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,800
 that 4.2 million there is about. But let me share briefly about those three items

433
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:03,200
 that you see. The first one is rent and facilities. So what those costs entail are

434
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,680
 rent, utility and management fees. So that's included in that, and that's 3.5

435
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,040
 million. And then secondly, you have pastoral outreach expenses. So what that

436
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,840
 includes are pastoral salaries. It includes doing the work of preaching,

437
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,760
 teaching, evangelism, but it's also all the volunteer work and ministries with

438
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,440
 children and community outreach. And that involves things like purchasing

439
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,760
 subscriptions, Orange for the children that program and purchasing resources in

440
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,640
 our community work that we'll use there as well. And then finally, we have also

441
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,320
 the additional operating expenses, which that is 500,000 Hong Kong dollars. And

442
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:56,000
 that includes such things as cleaning, IT support and insurance.

443
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,720
 So this is the kingdom investment that we're asking you to partner with us in,

444
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,720
 and that will help us to launch this church in Yuen Long and do the work that

445
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,000
 we believe God is calling us to do there. But I want to take a step back and just

446
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,760
 do a little bit more heart sharing about this church plant. In the Gospel of John,

447
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,560
 Jesus, after he was crucified and resurrected, he appeared to his disciples.

448
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:34,000
 And he said to them, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, I am sending

449
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,280
 you." Now, as Christians, we are sent people. Everything, there is no Christian

450
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,160
 who is not a sent person. We might not be aware of it. We might not fully know what

451
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,560
 that means, but we're sent people. And Jesus, he has sent us out to continue his

452
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:02,080
 work, his healing and restoring work, his Gospel work. And we get to choose whether

453
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:08,880
 or not we say yes to that work in this world. Now, when we talk about Gospel here

454
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,000
 at the Vine, we have a very specific understanding of what we mean by that.

455
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,920
 It involves our relationship with God. There's some healing and restoration

456
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,920
 that needs the reconciliation that needs to happen there. We're talking about our

457
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,600
 relationship with others. There's a lot of conflicts and breakdown, and the Gospel

458
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,480
 speaks into that and wants to heal and restore our relationship with our

459
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,920
 neighbors. And then we're also talking about our relationship with ourselves.

460
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,040
 We have conflicted relationships with ourselves where God wants to meet us and

461
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,840
 also put things in order and bring healing and wholeness. And then there's

462
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:54,000
 also relationship with the world, with the city, and where the Gospel also calls us

463
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,880
 to healing and restoring type of work. Now, it's easy to lose sight of that, this

464
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,320
 mission and this being sent out, and to lose sight of that urgency. Now, we talk

465
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:20,080
 about healing and restoration, and also what that means is now just think of this,

466
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,080
 when you have to...in redemption. So when you have to redeem something, redemption

467
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,800
 actually means to set free. So there's some setting free that needs to happen

468
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,160
 that God wants to do in this world. And then when you talk about healing and

469
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,720
 restoration, there's brokenness, there's pain, and God wants to bring healing to

470
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,240
 that. That's the type of work that Jesus has sent us out to do. And there is an

471
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,800
 urgency to that work. But I don't know, a lot of times it's easy for us to lose

472
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,080
 that sense of mission and to lose that sense of urgency to do this work. Now, I

473
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,000
 don't know about you, but when I first became a Christian, it was amazing. I was

474
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,400
 set free from spiritual oppression. And my life really was turned around. And

475
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:16,160
 instead of living in fear, I lived with knowing that God is more powerful than

476
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,640
 evil and knowing that I can come to Him and that He is with me and I'm not alone.

477
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,240
 But it's easy to forget that, to get used to that. It actually becomes our kind of

478
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:36,400
 our new normal, like the blessings of knowing Jesus.

479
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,800
 But we have the significant work to do of, in partnering with the Father, Son, and

480
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,800
 Holy Spirit, of doing this healing, restoring, life-transforming work. And He's

481
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,560
 inviting us as church into that. And as I was praying over today, I had the

482
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,600
 sense that with this River Vision and also with this church plant, God is

483
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,960
 renewing the sense of mission and renewing the sense of urgency with us as

484
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,320
 a church family as we go out, as we do this work of sharing the gospel and of

485
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:18,240
 healing and restoration. Now, I was thinking also of a passage that came to

486
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,640
 mind with Paul. He writes to the Corinthian church. Now, the Corinthian

487
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,520
 church, there was a lot of fighting within. There was a lot of focus on their

488
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,440
 own blessings. And so into that situation, Paul speaks, and these are just part of

489
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,800
 his words, but he says, "I have become all things to all people so that by all

490
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,640
 possible means I might save some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel that

491
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:52,640
 I may share in its blessings." So Paul has set aside his privileges. He has set

492
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,400
 aside his comforts. He has set aside his preferences for the sake of other people.

493
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,720
 It says he became all things for all people. So he became like a Jew. He became

494
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,520
 like Gentiles. And Gentiles, by the way, that means lots of different people

495
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,280
 groups and cultures. Now, being all things to all people could sound like

496
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,480
 people-pleasing. You know, when I'm with them, then I'm just like them. When I'm

497
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,720
 with the other people, I'm like the other people. Or it could even seem perhaps

498
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,080
 manipulative. When I'm there, then I'm like them. And when I'm here, I'm like

499
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,920
 them. And everybody thinks I'm on their side. But that's not what being all

500
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,840
 things to all people is about. What that really means is that Paul has taken the

501
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:37,440
 time. He has immersed themselves in their culture. He has gotten to know their

502
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,480
 stories, their joys, their pains, their hopes, their dreams. And then because he

503
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,880
 has taken this time to understand, he also understands how the gospel speaks

504
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,480
 to the particular people he is serving. And he is able to bring the gospel to

505
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,720
 bear to these people in ways that is transformative, in a way that is helpful

506
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,520
 for them and that they can connect with. And so as we are being sent out to

507
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,480
 Plantus Church in Yulong, we're also sent out to be all things to all people as

508
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,160
 we go to Yulong, as we get to know the different people who live there, the

509
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,720
 different generations. There's even generational differences. But also people

510
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,720
 of different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. And we start with listening

511
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,160
 and getting to know them, immersing themselves, learning about what are their

512
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,880
 fears, what are their hopes, what are their joys, what are their pains. And then

513
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,720
 as we have done this work of listening, we also understand how to serve them.

514
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,440
 And we're not just doing something which maybe they don't need or is not helpful,

515
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,320
 but because we've taken this time, we understand now how to be helpful.

516
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,760
 And then as we serve, the Holy Spirit also opens up opportunities to share about

517
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,760
 the love of Jesus, to share the gospel with people. And that's how we're being

518
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,520
 sent out and how we want to immerse ourselves in the community.

519
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:21,440
 And so ultimately, planting a church in Yulong, it's a desire to bring that joy

520
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,120
 of knowing Jesus, that only Jesus can bring, and sharing that with other

521
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:33,520
 people. It's a decision to not just focus on us feeling good and blessed, but also

522
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,080
 wanting others to share in that same blessing and being sent out in that way.

523
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:45,600
 But then also we get to just serve and be a blessing in the town in whichever way

524
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,640
 we can and just contribute it to the flourishing and well-being. And that

525
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:58,400
 honors God. And so with your partnership, that's how we aim to go out, plant this

526
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,600
 church, and see lives touched and transformed by the power of Jesus. So, thank you.

527
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:17,360
 - Love it. So grateful that we have Tim and Ivan, who are very much God's men,

528
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:22,160
 and with their wives and their families going to be serving in that space. And we

529
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,880
 really honor you guys. I want to just do one more thing. And I want to just bring

530
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,120
 us very quickly back to Ezekiel 47 in that passage. And I want to show you one

531
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,040
 more thing that's in there as we go to the most important time of our gathering

532
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,800
 together today, which is our giving that we're going to do in a moment. It says

533
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,720
 here in this passage we looked at earlier, it says, "Fishermen will stand along the

534
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,040
 shore from the En Gedi to the En Gelam, where there will be many places for the

535
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,440
 spreading of nets." If you want to know where you are in this vision, that's where

536
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:57,120
 you are. You are a fisher person who has the net of the gospel in your hands. And

537
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,760
 this is our chance to do something together. The reality is that not everybody

538
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,440
 in this room is going to go to Yen Long and start serving and being a part of

539
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,320
 that church plant. Maybe some of you in this room will be a part of that, but

540
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:13,920
 many of us probably won't be. But every single one of us here, we are on that

541
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:21,120
 shore watching that river flow, and we have nets. And our job together, the joy

542
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:26,000
 of being a church family together, is we get to cast the nets together. There's

543
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,080
 that amazing moment in Nehemiah where Nehemiah is called by God to rebuild the

544
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,360
 wall, and he gets all the citizens of Israel to stand outside their own homes

545
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,880
 and build the little bit of wall just outside their home. And it's like

546
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,560
 everybody had a chance to contribute to that bigger project. And that's exactly

547
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,200
 what this fishermen along the seashore is really about. All these people grabbing

548
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,640
 a hold of a part of the net and saying, "We're going to stand with what the vine

549
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,760
 is doing here. We're going to stand with this idea of doubling down in Hong Kong

550
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,920
 with the gospel. We're going to stand on this idea of Yen Long. And I may remain

551
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,120
 worshiping in one tribe, but I'm going to grab a hold of this net. I'm going to

552
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,560
 chuck it out there with everybody because I believe in what the vision of

553
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,640
 God is doing in this place." And that's what we're about to do together. Whether

554
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,960
 you give one dollar or you give a million dollars, the actual amount is

555
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,520
 what's decided about between you and God. And my heart is not what you actually

556
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,760
 give. My heart is that each one of us gives. That each one of us takes our role

557
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,920
 and puts our hand on that net. I was reminded this morning as we were praying

558
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,920
 for our time of giving together today. I was reminded of Jesus saying to Peter on

559
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,080
 the boat. He said, "Hey, why don't you throw the net on the other side?" And

560
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,080
 Peter was like, "Dude, I'm the fisherman here. You're the rabbi, okay? I know what

561
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,080
 I'm doing." And Jesus said, "Just give it a go." And Peter threw it on the other

562
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,440
 side of the boat. And of course, the catch was miraculous. He couldn't even haul it

563
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,720
 into the boat. There were so many fish. I feel like this is what God's saying to

564
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,920
 the vine. It's so funny. During the last couple of weeks, people have been

565
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,120
 saying to me, "What? You're church planting in this time of Hong Kong's

566
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,760
 history? Why would you do that?" I feel like this is a throw the net on the

567
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,680
 other side of the boat moment. Are you with me? Like this is our chance to

568
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,960
 actually say to those people who are saying, "Why would you invest in Hong Kong

569
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,520
 right now?" We can say, "Watch how many fish we're about to catch. Thank you very

570
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,320
 much." We're going to throw the net where the Holy Spirit wants us to throw it.

571
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,680
 That's what we're doing. And that's what your opportunity is right now. So here's

572
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,000
 how this is going to work. Let me give you some logistics, and then we're going

573
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,840
 to give all together. On your seat, would you just grab this little envelope that

574
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,360
 you have either sat on, crumpled up under your bum bum, or that you've nicely

575
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,040
 removed at some point before you sat down. But this envelope is the way in

576
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,400
 which you can give today. We want everybody who gives anything to give

577
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,720
 through this envelope. If you want to give cash in this envelope, if you want

578
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,480
 to write a check, you would put that in this envelope. Also on this envelope, if

579
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,440
 you can have a look here, you'll see there's some QR codes. If you want to

580
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,600
 give digitally, you can do that as well. If you're watching online right now,

581
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,440
 Chapman and his team are going to show you how you can give digitally. So that

582
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,760
 will also be information for you guys. You can give by octopus here today. We

583
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,640
 have machines outside and down in the lobby that will do that for you. You can

584
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,400
 also give by credit card. And if you want to give by credit card today, the way you

585
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,960
 can do that is straight out here on the second floor. If you're in the upper

586
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,600
 house, you'll need to come down to the second floor. If you're here straight

587
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,600
 outside the doors here on the second floor, Ada and her finance volunteers are

588
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,360
 there, and they will take your credit card. They'll swipe it. You'll get your

589
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,680
 miles. It'll be wonderful. All right. So if you want to give that way, you can

590
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,240
 give by credit card. It doesn't really matter how you give. It's just that every

591
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,240
 single one of us is going to do that in this time. And so what we're going to do

592
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,040
 is we're going to have some worship. We're going to be worshiping together as

593
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,560
 a community. And we always do this on Vision Sunday. We give in the atmosphere

594
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,320
 of worship. Giving is not about knowing what the person beside you is doing,

595
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,240
 right? What we're not going to be doing is watching everybody go to the baskets

596
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,760
 to give and seeing how fat their envelopes are, okay? That's not what we're

597
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,440
 doing. What we're doing is worshiping God. We're focusing on him and allowing

598
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,720
 him to speak to us and saying, "Yeah, I'm going to grab a net. I'm going to put

599
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,560
 my hands on that. And God, this is the amount I'm going to do." So you're going

600
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,840
 to fill in your envelopes during our time of worship. Worship will go for

601
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,360
 about five minutes or so. You'll have plenty of time. During worship, we want

602
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,760
 you to give. And how you can do that, there's baskets here at the front on the

603
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,040
 lower house. There's baskets in the middle of the lower house as well. So

604
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,400
 wherever you are in the lower house, there's a basket near you. Sometime

605
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,840
 during the five minutes of worship, as we sing and worship together, and you're

606
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,280
 ready, go and just drop your envelope into one of those baskets. If you're in

607
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,000
 the upper house, you'll notice that there's two baskets right at the front

608
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,600
 of the upper house. Same for you guys. In the next five minutes, when you feel

609
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,880
 led by the Holy Spirit, just come and bring your envelope and drop it off in

610
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,160
 the basket. And that's your way you're giving today. And we are so grateful

611
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,240
 that we get to do that all together. So would you stand with me, church? May I

612
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:54,000
 pray over us. And we're going to do this all together as one family. Let's pray.

613
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,840
 Father, we just are so grateful. So grateful that we get to hear of this

614
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,840
 vision. So grateful that we get to pray and believe now for Yuen Long, that we

615
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,200
 can now talk about Yuen Long together, Lord. So grateful that we can, Lord,

616
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,960
 partner for the gospel in this hour of our city. And Lord, we want to throw the

617
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,040
 net on the other side. And in many ways, Yuen Long's all the way on the other

618
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,440
 side of Hong Kong from Wan Chai. And we're excited for that, Lord. And so as

619
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,520
 we worship now, as we celebrate, as we sing this song that expresses so much

620
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,040
 of your promise and your faithfulness, Lord, we're going to give. And we're

621
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,400
 going to give boldly, courageously, as an honor to you. And we thank you for

622
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,240
 the opportunity to do that in Jesus' name. Everyone says, "All right, well,

623
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,760
 let's worship together. And at some point, why don't you do your giving?"

624
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,760
