[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   a redemptive story of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.560]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.360]   that such a story brings.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.440]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.200]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.640]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.520]   and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.760]   A church that sees salvation as holistic,
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.560]   transforming God's people for God's work
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.580]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.400]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the persecuted.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.280]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.620]   as integral to all that it's called to be and do,
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.020]   involving intentional, committed,
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.900]   and authentic relationships across all levels.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.800]   It is the sort of place where both the young
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.200]   and the old feel cared for, supported, and equipped.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.520]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.800]   come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.480]   that honors and embraces a richness in diversity
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.760]   that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.280]   It is a church that is willing to innovate
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.800]   and express faith creatively,
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.000]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.360]   as glory to Him.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.700]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.720]   and passionate to see this invade
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.400]   all aspects of their lives,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.240]   where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.680]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.680]   A church that does not make its Sunday services
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.000]   the exclamation mark of its existence,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.240]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.800]   a time of service, love, and engagement
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.920]   that inspires and emboldens all equally
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.080]   for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.240]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.520]   This is our city.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.020]   This is our church.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.320]   This is our home.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.380]   - Good morning, church.
[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.600]   It is so good to see you.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.920]   Welcome.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.760]   Hey, if you're looking for a place,
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.880]   you can find a seat right now.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.160]   Yeah, so my name is Tim.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.520]   I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.240]   And every week, we come here to gather,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.120]   to explore who Jesus is,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.160]   to understand what it means to know Him, to follow Him,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.540]   and to also lift up His name and praise.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.760]   So as I was praying and preparing for today,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.920]   I was thinking of a friend of mine who is a worship leader,
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.920]   and he does something that I always find powerful,
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.080]   and I actually wanna do that with you.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.600]   Does that sound good?
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.520]   Yes?
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.520]   Right, so he encourages people to give God thanks,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.840]   but what he does is he says this.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.080]   He's like, if you are breathing,
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.960]   you have something to be thankful for.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.560]   If you slept in a bed last night,
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.040]   you have something to be thankful for.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.280]   If you ate a meal this morning,
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   you have something to be thankful for, 'cause God is good.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.200]   He is the provider of everything we have.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.280]   And for us, the truth is a lot of times,
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.800]   there are challenges that we face, right?
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.280]   There are things that even we're facing right now,
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.600]   and so it's easy to just focus on them.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.440]   There's actually still a lot of things
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.840]   that we can give God praise for.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   So what I wanna encourage you right now,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.600]   and children, this is for you as well.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.840]   I want you to think of two things that you are thankful for
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.440]   and actually turn to your neighbor
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.200]   and tell them what you are thankful for.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.040]   Does that sound good?
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.920]   Can we do that?
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.360]   Two things you're thankful for.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.680]   Let's do that right now.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.400]   All right, hey, I would love to hear
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.840]   like one or two things that you said.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   So would somebody be willing to share,
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.640]   what are you thankful for?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.240]   Family, okay, what else?
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.520]   Your wife, oh, he's scoring some points.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.200]   Good job, Kieran.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.360]   What else?
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.880]   For the people serving here,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.320]   yes, we are so thankful for them.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.880]   You know, when we come to worship,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.160]   actually one way of entering into God's presence
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.240]   is by giving thanks and by praising him.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.560]   And so I wanna actually prepare our hearts right now.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.920]   There's a verse from Psalm 100, verse four.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.440]   It says, "Enter his gates with thanksgiving
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.520]   "and his courts with praise.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.840]   "Give thanks to him and praise his name."
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.320]   So I wanna invite everyone to stand
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.000]   and would love to pray for us
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.880]   as we prepare our hearts for worship.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.840]   Jesus, we thank you that you are so good to us.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.720]   You have given us so much.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.960]   You have given us everything.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.560]   You've given us family, you've given us spouses,
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.320]   you've given us people who serve,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.880]   you died for our sins, you gave us breath, Lord.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.360]   And we right now just wanna turn around
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.000]   and just give you praise 'cause you are worthy of it.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.440]   You deserve it.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.560]   You deserve our songs.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.400]   You deserve our thanksgiving.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.800]   And right now, Holy Spirit,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.960]   we just wanna welcome your presence.
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.680]   We wanna welcome your presence.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.600]   And we wanna turn our hearts and our attention to you.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.400]   I pray all this in your name, Jesus, amen.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.000]   (gentle music)
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:43.800]   - Our Father.

[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.500]   I love seeing all the conversations,
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.500]   love all the connections happening.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.500]   Hey, there are several things
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   that I wanna keep you in the loop and keep you updated on.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   First, as I already mentioned,
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.500]   we have your bring your own lunch.
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.500]   Basically, after the service,
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   either you've brought your lunch,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   you put it in the fridge,
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   or you go out, grab something, come back,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500]   and we're just gonna have lunch together.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.500]   Now, this is a great way of meeting people here,
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   of connecting.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   It's also a good way of catching up
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   for those of you who are part of this community.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500]   So just encourage you to come.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   It's always a great time.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.500]   So bring your own lunch
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.500]   just after the service happening then.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.500]   Next, we have, and I'm really excited about this,
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   on June 1st, we have our parenting workshop,
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   2 to 4 p.m., and the topic is
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.500]   I have big emotions too.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   And basically, it's about,
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.500]   the workshop's about identifying your parenting triggers
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:24.500]   and building stronger relationships with your children.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.500]   And our speaker is Dr. Elaine Tang,
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   and she's gonna help us to cultivate
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.500]   some self-awareness for effective parenting.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.500]   We're also gonna explore values
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.500]   that we carry ourselves with parenting,
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   and emotions, and learn practical strategies
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   to enhance our relationship with our children.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   So there's a lot of packed in there.
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   This is gonna be awesome.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.500]   So if you're a parent, or you know someone
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.500]   that could benefit from this,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   I wanna encourage you to invite them.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.500]   So we do four of these a year,
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.500]   two in Cantonese, two in English.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   This is the English one.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   We have our Cantonese one in March.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.500]   We have another one coming up sometime in the near future.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:11.500]   This is one way that we wanna love, and serve,
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.500]   and contribute to the flourishing of our city.
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.500]   So this is one intentional and strategic investment
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   that we make, that we bring high-quality speakers
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   who run very practical workshops
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:27.500]   so that anyone who comes will be equipped,
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.500]   will gain some new tools that they can walk away with
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.500]   and their family can flourish.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   And so if you know anyone,
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.500]   share it in your mom's groups, your dad's groups.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.500]   I don't know if their dad's usually in enough groups, right?
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.500]   It's usually mom's groups.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   Share it in your mom's groups.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.500]   Invite people.
[00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   And by the way, we've made it free.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.500]   We didn't want any barrier for anyone to come.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.500]   So if you're single parent, traditional family,
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   doesn't matter, you are welcome to come.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500]   But do please sign up and let us know
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   because there will also be some beverages
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   and some little treats and things.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.500]   So this is gonna be amazing.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.500]   All right, next, we owe you an update.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.500]   Vision Sunday happened in March.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   So on Vision Sunday, we shared, we wanted to,
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   our aim, our goal was to raise 400,000 Hong Kong dollars
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.500]   as a new church plant.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   And so part of that, of course,
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   is for us to continue to carry out our mission,
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   our vision of bringing the gospel to this community.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.500]   And I just, I'm really excited.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   I wanna share with you how much we raised.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.500]   Drum roll.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   Yay!
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.500]   705,440 Hong Kong dollars.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.500]   So praise God.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   He did more than we could ask for, imagine.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.500]   So thank you for your generosity in that.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   Now, you might wonder what's next,
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.500]   what's gonna happen with this.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   So there's just a couple of things
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.500]   that I wanna share on that.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:58.500]   First, 433,000, I'm not gonna say the whole number,
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.500]   will go to operations and ministry expenses and reserve.
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.500]   Now, what does that involve?
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   For one, it just involves us simply being able
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   to gather here on Sundays.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   It involves K-alpha, it involves K for C,
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   it involves anything that happens in here.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.500]   And so this just allows us to continue
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   to carry that forward and gives us some stability
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.500]   by building a reserve.
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   Since we're a new church, this is significant,
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   important for us to have a little bit of reserve
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   and operation security.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.500]   Then the second part, 272,000,
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.500]   will go into special outreach and community projects.
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.500]   So you already heard about the parenting workshop.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.500]   That's one of those where we seek to reach out
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.500]   and just bless our neighbors
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.500]   and form relationships with them.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:50.500]   Also, we're in the process of starting a youth group.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.500]   So this will also be used to do special events
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:56.500]   for youth in this community and to connect
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   and to reach them.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   Then we also are in the process
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   of forming relationships with mission partners,
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   people who serve here in the community
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:11.500]   in incredible ways and have an impact.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.500]   We want to partner with them.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   We want to pray for them.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   We want to also support them financially.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   Because we could try to do the things they are doing,
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   but we would at best do a mediocre job.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   They do an incredible job,
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   so we want to partner with them
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.500]   and strategically invest in those partnerships
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.500]   where we can contribute to the flourishing
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.500]   of people here in this community.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.500]   So we're in the process with one organization.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.500]   Once we're through with that,
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   and that's signed off and everything,
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   we'll announce that.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.500]   Our aim is to have two of those mission partnerships
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.500]   established by the end of the year.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   So you can pray that the Holy Spirit also leads us
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.500]   in both of these and just leads us
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   to the right partnerships as well.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   So I'm excited.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   This really is helping us make a major investment
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   in this community, in this city,
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.500]   to turn lament into joy
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   and for us to continue to work as a church.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   So praise God.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   Thank you for your generosity.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.500]   Now, right now we're going to transition
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.500]   into a time of our tithes and offerings.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.500]   I want to invite the welcome team to come up.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:26.500]   So we are--part of our worship is our finances,
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.500]   how we steward them.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   Everything we have is from God.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   So this is one way of us loving God back
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.500]   with our finances,
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   making funds available for him, for his work.
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.500]   And so thank you for all your generosity
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   and all your giving always.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.500]   Here are different ways that you can give.
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   There is digital ways, which are popular.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.500]   There's also the buckets going around with envelopes
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.500]   if you prefer that.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.500]   What's helpful for us as a new church plant is always
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   if you set up online automatic giving
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   that helps us with planning
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.500]   and we know what we're working with.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   So if you consider us your home church,
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   please do pray about that.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.500]   But I would love to pray for the offering
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.500]   and also the Vision Sunday giving
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.500]   and just pray a blessing over that.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.500]   So let me pray.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   Jesus, we are humbled by how you have been providing
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.500]   for us in this church plant.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.500]   Every step of the way, you have been faithful
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.500]   and you have provided what we need when we need it.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   And we want to give you praise for that.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   We thank you for all that's been raised by the Vision Sunday,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   for all the people who were able to give.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.500]   And we want to lift up what's given today
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.500]   and what was given then,
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.500]   that it may be used for your glory and for your purpose
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.500]   to reach the city, to love the city
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.500]   with your good news, the gospel message,
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.500]   and also to do works of justice and mercy
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.500]   for the marginalized
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.500]   and those who need others to advocate
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   and to step up for them as well.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.500]   And so we want to give you all the glory
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.500]   and I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   All right. Hey, I'm excited
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   because I want to invite a very cool person up.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.500]   Chapman, Pastor Chapman.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.500]   Come on up. Okay.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.500]   Watch out. Don't trip.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.500]   Can you hear me here? Okay, come on.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.500]   Come in here. All right.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   So Chapman is one of our pastors
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.500]   and I'm going to pray for him right now.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.500]   Does that sound good?
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.500]   All right. You can stretch out your hands towards him as well.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   Jesus, I thank you for my brother here who loves you.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.500]   I pray that you powerfully speak through him
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   as he proclaims your word,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.500]   that you just anoint him, anoint his tongue,
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   and that you also prepare our hearts to receive
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   what it is that you want to say to us.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.500]   So I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:55.500]   Oh, wow. Your lights are pretty bright.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   Bright here. I hope you don't mind.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.500]   But yeah, I can take this off as well.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.500]   Oh, wow.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.500]   This reminds me of the very first day
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.500]   that I first saw light in my life.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.500]   Ah, what a wonderful memory.
[00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:19.500]   Actually, I can't stop telling that story again and again in my life.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.500]   Oh, but since--yeah, I know.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.500]   We've never met before, right?
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.500]   This is the first time I meet you.
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.500]   So I'm just going to let you know a little bit about myself.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   Hi, everyone. My name is Bar Timaeus.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.500]   I'm Jewish, and I'm not going to tell you about my age.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   But, you know, in our language, which is Aramaic, by the way,
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.500]   Bar, my name Bar, means son.
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.500]   And my father's name was Timaeus.
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   So my name literally means son of Timaeus.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:58.500]   I guess when he named me, he was expecting me to be like him.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.500]   But then I guess he was really frustrated or disappointed the day
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   when he found out I was actually blind.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.500]   When I was young, my parents, they loved me.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.500]   They don't normally talk about my condition,
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.500]   but they actually taught me how to survive.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.500]   I remember there was one night at home.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.500]   I was supposed to be sleeping, and I heard them crying outside,
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.500]   and they were saying something like--they're praying, saying,
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.500]   "Forgive our sins, Lord," and I don't know what that means.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.500]   But later I heard somebody said,
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:39.500]   "Actually, blindness and other disabilities is normally a form
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.500]   of punishment from the Lord."
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   I remember that night I went home at dinner, and I told my parents,
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:51.500]   I said this, I said, "Father, Mother, is the Lord punishing us?
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.500]   That's why I'm blind?"
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:01.500]   That was the longest silence I've ever experienced.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.500]   My father and my mother, they haven't said another word that night,
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:10.500]   and I just decided I'll never bring that up again.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.500]   Don't get me wrong, my parents, they do love me.
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   They took good care of me, but eventually they passed.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.500]   Everybody does, right?
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   Someone like me, I wasn't able to do any kind of work,
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.500]   because any kind of work, it would mean physical labor,
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   like farming or fishing, and I couldn't see,
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.500]   and I couldn't do any of that.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.500]   I had no income.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   So soon after my parents were gone, I ended up on the streets.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:48.500]   What else can a blind man like me do except begging for money,
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.500]   begging for people to spare some change for me?
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   So every day when the rooster crows, "Cuckoo, cuckoo,"
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.500]   I'll just make my way to the market.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:03.500]   I'll go outside the market and wait for people to come.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.500]   And I know what time people come.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.500]   It's normally when I could feel the heat of the sun on my face.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.500]   That's the time when people started coming.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.500]   And you know what? I'll tell you something.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.500]   If you want to be a beggar outside the market, there's a strategy.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.500]   Yes, being a beggar, you need strategy as well.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.500]   So what I would do is I would go to the entrance of the market,
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.500]   but I cannot be too close to the stores,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   otherwise the store owners would get mad at us,
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.500]   and they would drive us away.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.500]   But I can't be too far away either, because if I stay too far away,
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.500]   people, after they are leaving the market, they would either miss us,
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   or they would have given all their spare change to those beggars
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.500]   closer to the market, so it takes strategy.
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   And me and my buddies, we are really good at strategies,
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.500]   and one day we found out a great strategy.
[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   Do you know who are the most generous people in all of Judea?
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.500]   It's actually those people who are going to the temple
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.500]   to present the sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:11.500]   And so me and my friends, we found a good spot outside the city of Jericho,
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.500]   because there were a lot of travelers going or going to
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.500]   or coming back from Jerusalem.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   And so we would sit there and just wait for someone to drop by.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:29.500]   And one day, one day there was another large crowd passing by
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.500]   and headed to Jerusalem.
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   Oh, I thought, you know, it could be some Pharisees, rabbis, and their followers.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.500]   But let me tell you, they are bad business.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.500]   You know, the Pharisees, they are known for their love for money.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:49.500]   They are very stingy people, but they love to put on a show for everyone.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.500]   So what they would do is, when there's a large audience,
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.500]   these Pharisee rabbis, they would come to people like us,
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.500]   and they would start talking about, oh, how the law instructs them
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   to care for people like us.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.500]   And they would say, "Oh, yes, I love the law. I love the Lord,"
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.500]   and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:12.500]   And then in the thunder of applause, everybody was clapping,
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   and they would throw us a few cents, not even enough for my lunch.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   They would even expect us to go to them and say, "Oh, thank you for your generosity, sir.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   Thank you so much."
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   The memory of that makes me sick.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:38.500]   But just out of curiosity that day, just because I do want to find out who it was,
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   I shouted. I said, "Excuse me, who are you following?"
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:51.500]   Yeah, like that. Nobody responded.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:55.500]   I think after five times, I have shouted the same thing.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.500]   Finally, perhaps someone was kind enough, or maybe they were too annoyed by me.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:06.500]   They finally yelled back at me and said, "Oh, it's Jesus of Nazareth,
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.500]   what do you blind men know about the rabbi?
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:14.500]   Just keep quiet, man. Don't embarrass yourself."
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:19.500]   Jesus of Nazareth. Come on, surely I've heard of him.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.500]   Everybody in town have heard of him.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   People talk about him in the market. They talk about him on the streets.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.500]   Of course, they were skeptical at first.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:35.500]   They would say something like, "Oh, what good can come out of Nazareth?"
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   Or they would say, "A Galilean? Are you kidding me?
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.500]   Is he here to teach us how to fish?"
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   Well, but then I started to hear stories.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.500]   There was a story about him healing a paralyzed man.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:58.500]   I don't know how he did it, but what I heard was that man literally picked up his man and walked away.
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:06.500]   And I heard another story about him driving demons out of a man into some pigs.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:10.500]   That was a hilarious one, right?
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:21.500]   But later I heard of a story of Jesus opening the eyes of a blind man in Bethsaida.
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:32.500]   I'm like, "Really? Someone like me, a blind man, can be healed?"
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.500]   Then I remember I used to follow my parents to the synagogue,
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   and I would listen to the reading of scriptures.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   It was a brief moment in my life when I would feel I'm normal,
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.500]   because everybody else would be doing the same thing.
[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   They would just sit there and listen attentively to the reader or to the preacher, to the speaker.
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.500]   I felt I could blend in. I felt that moment.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:02.500]   I'm normal. I could just do what everybody else does.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.500]   That's the one thing that I really enjoy.
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   And I remember there was this particular book written by the prophet Isaiah,
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:17.500]   and then he talks about this figure, they call him the Messiah, the Son of David.
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.500]   He will bring us the kingdom of peace, of shalom.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:26.500]   And not only that, but there is a line in this book that says,
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:32.500]   "The eyes of the blind will be opened, the ears of the deaf will be unstopped,
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   the lame will leap like a deer, and the mute tongue will shout for joy."
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:47.500]   Every time when they read that, I just couldn't stop weeping.
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:53.500]   What beautiful words. What a wonderful promise.
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:49:02.500]   And then I start to wonder, would this Jesus of Nazareth be that anointed one,
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:04.500]   that promised Messiah?
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:14.500]   Could I be a part of his kingdom and experience shalom and feel complete for once in my life?
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.500]   When that name was mentioned that day outside the city of Jericho,
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   my entire body started shaking.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   I knew I had to call him. I knew if someone could help me, that would be him.
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   The next moment, I found these words just coming out of my mouth.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:42.500]   "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me, please."
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.500]   What else could I ask of a king?
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.500]   And he's just not a normal king, he's the king of kings.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:55.500]   What else could I ask him but to have mercy on a nobody like me?
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:50:01.500]   I actually don't know if Jesus has heard me, but those around surely did,
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   and they weren't very happy.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.500]   They were saying, "Keep your voice down, man."
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:14.500]   They were saying, "It's not time to ask for money. Get lost, you beggar."
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   Or someone say, "He's a very important man who's got important business in Jerusalem.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:26.500]   He's not here to entertain you. Just go home, you dude."
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   Usually when I hear this kind of stuff, I would try to hide.
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.500]   I would feel super embarrassed. I would run away.
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:39.500]   But in that instance, I knew I'd rather lose face and make a fool of myself
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:44.500]   than to lose the one opportunity to get my life changed.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:49.500]   I wanted this so badly that shame couldn't stop me.
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.500]   Their mean words and their rebuke couldn't stop me.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:58.500]   I gathered all my strength, and I yelled at the top of my lungs again,
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:04.500]   "Son of David, help me! Have mercy on me!"
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   And suddenly, I no longer heard footsteps.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:16.500]   The whole crowd quieted down as if they were waiting for something to happen.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:23.500]   And I heard a man's voice, "Cheer up, mate! On your feet! He's calling you!"
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   I could tell that voice, even though I couldn't see,
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:32.500]   I could tell that voice was directed to my direction, but I couldn't believe.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.500]   So I had to confirm. I said, "Me?"
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:40.500]   He said, "Yeah, you blind man. He wants to talk to you."
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:49.500]   "You mean the Messiah didn't just hear me, but he actually stopped to see me?"
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:56.500]   "I've never had someone who want to spend time with me ever since my parents were gone."
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:52:06.500]   "Everybody here, they tried to stop me, but Jesus, he stopped for me."
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:14.500]   "These people, they made me feel like I'm a nobody, but that day, Jesus made me feel I'm a somebody."
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:22.500]   I was so overwhelmed, but I jumped to my feet at once, and I walked towards that voice,
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:27.500]   and I could sense the crowd just parted like the Red Sea in front of me
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:33.500]   until I reached the other shore where Jesus was waiting for me.
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:41.500]   I will never forget his first words to me, and in fact, he asked me a question.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:48.500]   He said, "What do you want me to do for you?"
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.500]   "What do you mean, what do I want?"
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.500]   "No one has ever asked me such a question."
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:58.500]   "Who would care what a blind beggar wants?"
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:04.500]   "And if Jesus is king, I should be the one doing what he wants."
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:09.500]   "I should be the one bowing before him and said, 'Your will be done, my Lord.'"
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.500]   "I should be the one asking him that."
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:19.500]   And yet, he's asking me what I want.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:30.500]   Here, standing in front of me was a man who was king, and yet he acted like a servant.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:37.500]   With tears in my eyes, I uttered my wildest dream to him.
[00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:47.500]   I said, "My master, my Lord, I want to see."
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:53.500]   I never dared to say those four words, "I want to see" to anyone in my life.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:58.500]   People would just call me silly, or they would say, "It's impossible."
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:03.500]   "It's unrealistic." "Stop daydreaming."
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.500]   I never imagined someone would care to listen.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:13.500]   Just now I told you, when I used to listen to God's word in the synagogue,
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:18.500]   I felt I'm normal. But you know what?
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:25.500]   That day, I suddenly realized I felt I was a normal person
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:28.500]   when someone actually stopped to listen to me.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:35.500]   And what really blew my mind was that that someone, standing there,
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:45.500]   asking what I wanted, listening to my every word, he was God himself.
[00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   "Go," he said. "Your faith has healed you."
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:58.500]   Before he finished that sentence, I felt this warmth, this burning sensation in my eyes,
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:01.500]   and then it was brightness.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:07.500]   It's like walking out of a completely dark room into the bright, sunny day.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:11.500]   My faith in Jesus opened my eyes.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:19.500]   And when I looked up, I saw a face. I saw the face.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.500]   I remember in the synagogue, they used to pray this blessing over us.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   "The Lord make his face shine on you and be gracious to you."
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:34.500]   "The Lord turns his face towards you and give you peace."
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.500]   That's the face I saw that day.
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:43.500]   That's the very first face, indeed, in my life I've ever seen.
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:53.500]   And that's the face I'm going to see in eternity, the face of Jesus.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:58.500]   At that moment, I knew I wanted to follow him for the rest of my life.
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   I knew I'll go wherever he goes.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:06.500]   He's my healer. He's my savior. He's my king.
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:12.500]   I want to spend the rest of my life asking him, "What do you want me to do for you?"
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:19.500]   Or even better, "What do you want me to do with you, Lord?"
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:24.500]   I was a blind beggar sitting on the side of the road.
[00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:31.500]   But Jesus came. He stopped. He listened. And he responded.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:38.500]   So I'm telling you guys, today, if you cry out to him, he would do the same for you.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.500]   He would come into your life. He would stop for you.
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:46.500]   He would listen to you, and he would respond.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.500]   What is that you want to tell him today?
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:56.500]   Where in your life you need him to heal you and save you, to zozo you?
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:05.500]   Come to him today and cry out to him, "Jesus, have mercy on me."
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:23.500]   [silence]
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:27.500]   Greetings, my dear friends. Peace be with you.
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.500]   [applause]
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.500]   Oh, thank you for that.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.500]   How are you guys doing today?
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   My name is John. I'm one of the disciples of Jesus.
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.500]   Isn't the story of Bartimaeus amazing? Can you give him a round of applause?
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.500]   [applause]
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   But I want to tell you this. What's even more wonderful for me personally
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:58:00.500]   is that the day when Bartimaeus received his sight, I received mine too.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:05.500]   The day when his eyes were open, so were mine.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:10.500]   I remember that day very well. It was the final days we spent with Jesus
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:15.500]   before he was arrested, he was tortured, and finally crucified in Jerusalem.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:19.500]   In fact, we were on our way there. We were walking towards Jerusalem,
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:24.500]   and we came all the way from Galilee, and then we passed through Jericho in Judea,
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.500]   and we were headed towards Jerusalem.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:33.500]   And that was the Passover period, so there were lots of people going to Jerusalem
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:37.500]   alongside us, and we had a large crowd following us.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:42.500]   And you know Jesus, just being Jesus himself, he would seize every opportunity
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.500]   to teach the people about the kingdom of God.
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   But I could tell, being his friend, he was quite burdened inside.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:55.500]   It's in the small details. It's in the way how he looked at us.
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:59.500]   It's in the way how he would spend longer time away from us in solitude,
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.500]   like just praying by himself.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:08.500]   And he also told us, not just once, not just twice, but three times,
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:14.500]   that whatever is in store for him in Jerusalem, it's pain and suffering and death.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.500]   He said he's going to be killed there.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.500]   You know, of course, none of us wanted that to happen, right?
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.500]   He's a good friend. He's a rabbi.
[00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:27.500]   My best buddy, Peter, actually tried to talk him out of it,
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:31.500]   but yeah, it didn't end too well for him.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:36.500]   But even what's more bizarre was that he told us after he died,
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   he would rise again in three days.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:43.500]   We had no idea what he was talking about.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   But so far, let me tell you, following Jesus, yeah,
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   that kind of life is nothing short of miracles, surprises,
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.500]   and also riddles that none of us really understood.
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.500]   The one thing we were sure, though, was that he was the Son of God,
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.500]   and he is the Son of God.
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:07.500]   He's the Messiah that we've been waiting for.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:13.500]   We even saw him talking to Moses and Elijah on the top of a mountain.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:20.500]   He is going to be a Messiah, and what that means is he should be a conquering king.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   He will lead us in glorious victories and establish his kingdom
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.500]   over those Romans and other Gentiles.
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:33.500]   At least that was what I was told and what I had believed ever since I was a boy.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:35.500]   So that day, yeah, back to the story.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:40.500]   That day, we were passing by Jericho, and everybody cheered for us
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   like what you did just now.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   The whole town gathered literally on the two sides of the road just to see Jesus.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   After all the miracles and all the healings, you wouldn't be surprised
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:00.500]   if Jesus is the most popular, famous Jewish man on the planet, right?
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.500]   Everybody wants a piece of him.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   So sometimes I feel a little bit overwhelmed and, "Oh, that's too much."
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:10.500]   And you know, me and my brother James, we volunteered to be Jesus' bodyguards,
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:15.500]   like, "Hey, stop, stop there. We're his security detail."
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.500]   And we would exercise a little bit of crowd control.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   Okay, just let me tell you a fun fact.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500]   Me and my brother James, we have a nickname.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   We're called the Sons of Thunder because of our temper, I guess.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:31.500]   Anyway, but suddenly that day when we were getting out of Jericho,
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.500]   we heard a voice, a very loud voice that says, "Jesus, Son of David,
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.500]   have mercy on me."
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:43.500]   "Oh, Son of David. Huh, this guy knew what he was talking about, huh?"
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.500]   It seems we're not the only one who believe Jesus is the Messiah
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.500]   because that's what that phrase, "Son of David," means.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:55.500]   So I tried to look around, but I don't see who's talking.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.500]   And perhaps there was just too many people.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.500]   So then someone from the crowd just told me, "Oh, it's just a beggar.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.500]   He was probably asking for money."
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.500]   I'm like, "Okay, if he thinks Jesus is a rich Messiah,
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.500]   then he must be misguided."
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.500]   "Well, look at us. Look at me. Do I look rich to you guys?"
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   "I'm not rich. Jesus is not rich."
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   "But all right, anyway, just a beggar, just looking for money.
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500]   False alarm. Let's move on. Let's carry on.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:23.500]   We got to go find a place to rest before sunset, you know?
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:27.500]   It's really dangerous out here in the wilderness in Judea."
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.500]   But just as I was taking a few more steps down the road,
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.500]   that same voice yelled again, "Son of David,
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.500]   have mercy on me!"
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   And I thought, "Okay, I'm the bodyguard. I should deal with that."
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:48.500]   But before I walked to deal with him, Jesus, he stopped.
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:52.500]   I'm like, "Oh, come on.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.500]   If someone has any spare food for this guy,
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.500]   let's just give it to him so we can all be on our way.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:01.500]   Come on, come on. I don't have time."
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.500]   You know, "Now a glorious journey to Jerusalem.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:06.500]   It's going to be delayed.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   Who knows what's going to happen in Jerusalem?
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.500]   Jesus may actually become king there, you know,
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.500]   and we would have a royal status.
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.500]   He's messing with our schedule right now.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.500]   Could somebody just take care of him?"
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   You see, when would the procession of a king
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.500]   be interrupted by some homeless man, right?
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:28.500]   So he just want to go.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   And Jesus says, "Call him."
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   You know his voice is always so gentle, yet full of authority.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   And so we did. We called that guy over.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.500]   And a few moments later, we met the guy with the loud voice,
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.500]   and on top of that, he also had long and dirty hair.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.500]   He had worn out clothes and some very unpleasant smell.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   Oh, that guy was blind.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   So Jesus looked at him and said,
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.500]   "What do you want me to do for you?"
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.500]   "Wait, what did he just say?"
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.500]   I immediately turned and looked at my brother James,
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.500]   and he did the same. He just looked at me.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.500]   Because the day before,
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.500]   Jesus asked the two of us the exact same question.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   See, we were on the journey to Jerusalem,
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.500]   and we knew something big, something important was going to happen.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.500]   So of course, Jesus mentioned he was going to suffer and die,
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500]   and all that we know.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   But James and I, we decided to go and talk to Jesus.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.500]   And we said, "You know, we've been following you for so long,
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   and since the beginning, we were your first disciples.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.500]   Surely we deserve a front seat in the kingdom of God, right?"
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.500]   Can I get an amen for that?
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500]   No, none of you agree with me. That's okay.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:53.500]   And so we asked Jesus, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.500]   And Jesus asked the same question,
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.500]   "What do you want me to do for you?"
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:03.500]   Well, we shamelessly asked to sit at his right and his left.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.500]   Yeah, we want the fame. We want the power, right?
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.500]   Come on. We have laid down literally everything to follow Jesus
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.500]   in the last three years.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   We were by his side the whole time,
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.500]   and that's what we deserve.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   That's what we are entitled to, right?
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.500]   But look at this blind beggar.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.500]   What did he do to deserve this?
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.500]   What has he done to earn this favor
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:33.500]   that the Messiah himself would do something for him?
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.500]   He hasn't followed Jesus for a single day.
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.500]   He never preached the good news of the kingdom like we did.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   He never healed a sick person or drive out a demon like we have.
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   Why would he deserve this?
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.500]   And I heard he said, "My master, my Lord,
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.500]   I want to see."
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   And yet, there he goes once again.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.500]   As always, the miracle happened.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   And Bartimaeus, he immediately joined the company
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.500]   and followed Jesus.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.500]   He became part of us.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.500]   He became a brother.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.500]   And then I realized,
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:18.500]   Jesus didn't stop to perform a miracle.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:23.500]   Jesus actually was there to call a man.
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.500]   Just like the day when he called me and my brother James and Peter,
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.500]   he stopped and performed a miracle for us
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:34.500]   and called us to follow him.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500]   Whatever Jesus saw in me,
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.500]   he saw in Bartimaeus too.
[01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:46.500]   Who am I to think that I deserve and he doesn't?
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.500]   Isn't it only because of Jesus' grace
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.500]   that we are both saved and restored?
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:59.500]   That day, outside the city of Jericho,
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:03.500]   when Jesus opened the eyes of Bartimaeus,
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.500]   he opened mine too.
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.500]   While Bartimaeus, he could be physically blind,
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.500]   I, myself, and many other disciples,
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.500]   we were indeed spiritually blind.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:21.500]   We were blind to who Jesus was
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500]   and his real mission here on earth.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:27.500]   We were so obsessed with the image of a conquering king
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.500]   that we were blind to the suffering servant
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.500]   right in front of our eyes.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.500]   We were so obsessed with the success and achievements
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500]   we want Jesus to give us
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.500]   that we were blind to his call,
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.500]   which is to follow his examples
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.500]   and serve those around us.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   Our role as his disciples should be,
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.500]   supposed to be, to bring people to him,
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.500]   not to stop them from coming to him.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   And we've been doing such a poor job.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:01.500]   And no wonder we're also blind to the poor,
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.500]   to the vulnerable, to the marginalized,
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   to the needies around us.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500]   In our spiritual blindness,
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   we only focus on what we can gain in this life
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.500]   and we forgot what we could give.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.500]   We ignore the marginalized.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.500]   We say that their problem is not our problem.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:22.500]   What's even worse,
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.500]   when they try to voice out their problems,
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.500]   we silence them.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.500]   We tell them this is not the place and time
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.500]   to say these things.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.500]   Let's do it later.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.500]   Let's don't do it here.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   We don't have time for you.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.500]   But Jesus, Jesus doesn't stop people
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500]   from expressing their needs.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.500]   Instead, he stops for them.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   He sees them.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.500]   He listens.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.500]   He responds.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.500]   Jesus doesn't just want to heal the physically blind.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   He also wants to open the eyes
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   of the spiritually blind as well.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.500]   What kind of a church are we?
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   Are we a spiritually blind church?
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   Are we a spiritually blind disciple?
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.500]   That we are blind to the needs of those around us?
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   That we just turn a blind eye
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.500]   or we look away?
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.500]   Or are we blind to who Jesus really is
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:22.500]   and what he wants to achieve in this earth?
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   Are we spiritually blind
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   that we actually can't see Jesus' heart for the others?
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   That day Jesus opened my eyes.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.500]   I once was lost, but now I'm found.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.500]   I was blind, but now I see.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500]   I know what kind of a disciple
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.500]   I want to be since that day.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.500]   I want to be the kind of disciple of Jesus
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.500]   that would stop for people,
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.500]   that would see people as people,
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500]   that would listen to them,
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.500]   that would respond to their need.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   And what about you, my friends?
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   What kind of a Jesus follower would you want to be?
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.500]   I wonder where you find yourself
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.500]   outside the city of Jericho today.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   Are you the one sitting at the side of the road
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500]   like Bartimaeus
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.500]   and you're carrying with you a physical condition perhaps
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.500]   or maybe an emotional or even a relational issue
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:30.500]   and you need to cry out for Jesus' help?
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.500]   Or perhaps you're one of those standing in the crowd
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.500]   like the disciples,
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.500]   suffering from spiritual blindness.
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   You're either blind to Jesus,
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.500]   his identity and his mission on earth
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.500]   or maybe you're blind to the needs around you.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.500]   You know, if you're blind to the needs
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   of the people around you,
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:52.500]   that affects not just how you would interact with them,
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500]   that affects how God would interact with them
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.500]   through you as well.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.500]   So no matter where you are today,
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500]   Jesus is here
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500]   and he wants to heal you and save you,
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.500]   to zozo you.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.500]   All you need is to say,
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   "Have mercy on me, Lord."
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.500]   And I'm just wondering right across this room right now,
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.500]   who would love to pray this prayer with me?
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.500]   I myself, I definitely need to pray this prayer.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.500]   "Lord, have mercy on me, open my eyes."
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.500]   I wonder who wants to join me in this prayer.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   If that's you, I invite you to stand where you are
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:33.500]   and close your eyes.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   You know, sometimes it doesn't really matter
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   what we're seeing physically.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.500]   It matters even more what we can see spiritually.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.500]   And Jesus, he's so kind,
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500]   he's so faithful, he's so loving.
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500]   He wants to open your eyes
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.500]   and my eyes here today.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500]   So church,
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.500]   I can't do this on your behalf.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.500]   You must come to him.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.500]   I can only show you the way to Jesus
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.500]   and you have to be the one to cry out to him.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.500]   "Have mercy on me, Lord."
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.500]   Why don't we do it now?
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:21.500]   (silence)
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:25.500]   Jesus, you didn't just heal Bartimaeus that day.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:30.500]   You didn't just open his physically blind eyes.
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.500]   You healed your disciples.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.500]   You healed their spiritual blindness.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:37.500]   And God, today I pray that you would come into this place
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.500]   and do the same.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.500]   Whether it's a physical condition that needs to be zozoed,
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:45.500]   maybe an emotional one, a relational one, a mental one.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.500]   Jesus, I pray you would so kindly come and zozo us.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.500]   But I also ask you would come
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.500]   and open our eyes,
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:59.500]   especially those of us who are spiritually blind like myself.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.500]   That we will turn a blind eye
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.500]   to the people around us.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   Here in Yuen Long, here in Hong Kong,
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.500]   or maybe just right next door, our neighbors,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:17.500]   the person sitting next to us in the office,
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.500]   or when we are on the streets, those who need you.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:27.500]   Father, I pray that we would not just write them off casually
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.500]   and we wouldn't just walk past them
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500]   without even looking at them.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.500]   Not in a strange way, but...
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:38.500]   Father, I pray you would give us your vision,
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.500]   your perspective,
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.500]   when we are walking the streets of Hong Kong,
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.500]   the streets of Yuen Long.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.500]   We would actually be able to see the need,
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.500]   or even to listen to them,
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:52.500]   and respond to them.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.500]   Come Holy Spirit, help us.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:02.500]   [music]
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:09.500]   All these pieces broken and scattered
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:16.500]   In mercy gathered, mended and whole
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:23.500]   Empty handed, but not forsaken
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:31.500]   I've been set free, I've been set free
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:39.500]   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.500]   That saved a wretch like me
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   I once was lost, but now I am found
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.500]   Was blind, but now I see
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:07.500]   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:12.500]   That saved a wretch like me
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:21.500]   I once was lost, but now I am found
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.500]   Was blind, but now I see
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:33.500]   I can see you now
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:40.500]   I can see the love in your eyes
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:47.500]   Laying yourself down
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:53.500]   Raising up the broken to life
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:16:00.500]   I can see, oh I can see you now
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:07.500]   I can see the love in your eyes
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:14.500]   Laying yourself down
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:22.500]   Raising up the broken to life
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:45.500]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   Amazing grace, amazing grace
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.500]   How sweet the sound
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:58.500]   That saved a wretch like me
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:07.500]   I once was lost, but now I am found
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:11.500]   Was blind, but now I see
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:17.500]   Amazing grace, amazing grace
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:21.500]   How sweet the sound
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:26.500]   That saved a wretch like me
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:34.500]   I once was lost, but now I am found
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:38.500]   Was blind, but now I see
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:45.500]   Oh, I can see, I can see you now
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:52.500]   Oh, I can see the love in your eyes
[01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:58.500]   Laying yourself down
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:04.500]   Raising up the broken to life
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   I can see, I can see you now
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.500]   I can see the love in your eyes
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:25.500]   Laying yourself down
[01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:34.500]   Raising up the broken to life
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.500]   You know, as we were worshipping, I was just literally picturing
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:43.500]   our blindness, you know, falling from our face,
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:49.500]   our spiritual blindness just, you know, going away.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:54.500]   And I just wonder, what kind of church would we be
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:59.500]   if we would shake off our spiritual blindness?
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:04.500]   How would people see this gaze of Jesus' love through us
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:08.500]   in the city, around here?
[01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.500]   You know, I just wonder.
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.500]   Now, I don't know about you, but I long for that.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.500]   I want that, and I know I have blind spots myself.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:21.500]   So I want to just pray into that and pray that over us
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:26.500]   that we can be a church that shakes its blindness
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:32.500]   and that can see so that others can see and know Jesus.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:39.500]   So Jesus, we pray that you would free us
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.500]   from our spiritual blindness, where we get caught up
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.500]   with things like John was caught up with.
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.500]   I want this position, I want to sit here,
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:51.500]   I want things to be this way, I want to be comfortable.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:58.500]   That you disrupt us and that you show us
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.500]   how you want us to look at things,
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:04.500]   how you want us to look and listen to the people around us.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.500]   That you, us as a church, that you give us words,
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.500]   that you give us love, that you give us sacrifice,
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.500]   that we bring as we pour out your love over the city,
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.500]   as we pour out the love of the people,
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.500]   that you set us free from the spiritual blindness
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.500]   that puts us on a different mission,
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.500]   which is not your mission.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500]   Jesus, put us on your mission.
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:25.500]   Lord, where we've gone wrong, we say,
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500]   "Jesus, I'm sorry.
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.500]   Forgive me where I've gone wrong.
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:34.500]   Lead me in repentance.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.500]   Lead me in your love."
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.500]   So we thank you for this work that you've done
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:43.500]   right now in this room, and we pray that by your grace,
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.500]   not out of our own strength, but by your grace,
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.500]   that we live this out more and more as a church community.
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.500]   We pray this in your name, Jesus.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:56.500]   Amen. Amen.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:02.500]   Wow, what a gifted and talented actor, preacher we have.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.500]   So let's give Chapman a hand.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.500]   Thank you so much.
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   You know, it takes boldness to try that.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.500]   It's not easy to try something in front of people
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.500]   like a different way of preaching.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.500]   But it really--I don't know about you,
[01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.500]   but it really helped me to enter into the story
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.500]   in a different way and to see a lot more
[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.500]   than I've seen before.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:29.500]   So thank you, Chapman, for giving it a go.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.500]   Also, I just want to say thank you for everyone
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   who serves here.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.500]   We already had earlier that--
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.500]   and as we were giving Thanksgiving, but it's true.
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.500]   You know, we have so many people in so many different ways
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:41.500]   on different days who serve and who make this happen.
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.500]   Thank you for partnering with us.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   Thank you for just leading us so beautifully
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.500]   in worship today.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:50.500]   Thank you all for coming, for being part of this community.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.500]   We love you all.
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.500]   We hope to see you at the Bring Your Own Lunch.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.500]   That's happening now, but if not next week.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.500]   Also, if you would like prayer, we have a prayer team here.
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.500]   They would love to pray for anything, honestly,
[01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:05.500]   that you need prayer for.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.500]   It doesn't matter what it is.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.500]   They would love to pray with you, love to bless you.
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.500]   So please do take advantage of that.
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:12.500]   All right, love you all.
[01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:14.500]   Have an amazing Sunday.
[01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.500]   See you at Bring Your Own Lunch.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.500]   Okay, bye-bye.
