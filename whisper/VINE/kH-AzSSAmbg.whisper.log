[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Grateful that we don't just sing songs, but we encounter the risen Lord.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.440]   Grateful that in this room, in this moment, you're here by your presence and everyone
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.800]   watching right now, wherever they are in their homes, your presence is at work.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.440]   But we recognize with all the things that are happening in our world right now,
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.600]   you still count us worthy to visit us with your presence.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.400]   You are Emmanuel, the incarnation at work in this moment.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.680]   And we're so grateful. Lord, I want to pray as we open your word. Lord, we need your word, Lord.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.920]   Church, we just declare, don't we, that we're hungry for his presence
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.360]   and that we need his word, that we're thirsty. Lord, we're tired of hearing what the world has
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.480]   to say. Lord, we're tired of hearing what our social media feeds are telling us.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.960]   Father, we want to know what you have to say.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.160]   Lord, I want to pray as we open your word today, Father, you would open our eyes.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.600]   Father, we don't want to be blind to the realities of what you're doing in this hour and in this
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.240]   moment. Lord, we want to carry a different spirit in us. So Father, would you bring your word
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.560]   freshly to us? And Father, as we do so, I want to pray for liberation, freedom.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.920]   I feel just before I preach today, I feel some of you are carrying chains of fear.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.680]   And the shadow, it's almost like for some of you, you feel like you're living in a bit of a shadow
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.680]   right now. You've known what it is to live in the sunlight, but right now it feels like you're in
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.760]   a bit of a shadow. For some of us, the enemy is casting a big, broad shadow over us. I want to
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.440]   pray, Holy Spirit, that as we open the word today, that my words would fall away and your word
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.320]   would stick. I want to pray for the ministry of the Holy Spirit, for breaking chains, for bringing
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.240]   us out of shadows and bringing us into the light. For you, revive and refresh and renew your people.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.440]   So for every person in this room, everyone watching online, if anyone needs to be renewed
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.320]   by the refreshing of your word, would it come in this moment? We thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.840]   Everyone says, amen. Amen. Can we thank the worship team? Thanks guys so much.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.480]   Why don't you have a seat, have a seat. Welcome to everyone online. We're so glad that you guys
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.560]   are joining us from wherever you are. We know every single week we've got people from all over
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.960]   the world that are tuning in and connecting with us, and we are grateful for you. We know that you
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.520]   are a part of the Vine family, and at 30% right now, we can't get everybody in this room. You are
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.120]   with us, and so welcome. We're so glad. And welcome everyone else in the room right now. It is so good
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.840]   to see you. This is 30% of us. Have a look around the room. This is what 30% kind of feels
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.520]   and looks like. I'm longing for 50%, 75%, 100%, 130%. But we do not serve a 30% God in the name
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.640]   of Jesus. Can I have an amen? Like we are not expecting a 30% spirit in this moment, right?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.960]   I'm not going to preach a 30% word to you. All right? You guys look like you're asleep already.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.600]   That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. It's going to happen. Hey, so last week, we started
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.320]   a brand new series here at the Vine, and I started last week by saying that I think this is the
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.480]   central word that I think God has for us as a church in the season that we're in. I said last
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.720]   week boldly that I feel like we're in an inflection point for the gospel in this season of our city,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.360]   in this hour that we're in right now, that I think the church in the next couple of years has a
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.040]   decision to make in Hong Kong. Are we going to move forward with the gospel? Are we going to hold
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.360]   forward the hope of Jesus? Are we going to find ourselves finding life and boldness in the story
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.320]   and the narrative of the death and resurrection of Jesus? Or are we going to find ourselves
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   shrinking back and fading out into the sidelines? The inflection point is the reality that if we
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.520]   don't step forward, I feel like we could lose a generation for Jesus in this hour, in this moment,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.160]   in our city. I feel in my spirit a passion about that. I don't want to see us lose a generation
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.840]   in Hong Kong. And I challenged us last week that we need to think about how we as Christians are
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.040]   living the gospel in this important time. I mean, are we going to live the gospel as I think it's
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.920]   truly designed to be lived? Or are we going to settle for a gospel that keeps the lights on in
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.320]   here but shuts down the light out there? Like, are we going to stand forward and stand out? Are we
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.560]   going to shrink back? And are we going to fade out? And I argued last week that the difference for the
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.880]   church is that we would carry in us what we're calling a different spirit. That there might be
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   something different in us than what we see in the world around us. That we wouldn't be weird.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.480]   Hear me, Christian. I'm seeing you. That we wouldn't be weird and strange, but that we would be
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:20.880]   connected to the beauty of our city and its society, but to do so by offering something
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.680]   different from what's around us. We talked about last week that we are yeast and dough, not dough
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.920]   and dough. That in our workplaces, people might look at us and go, "How come that person has joy
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.200]   despite the fears we're all sharing about our future? How come that one understands what
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.720]   forgiveness is when I can't even forgive my wife? How can this one have so much hope when there
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:53.280]   seems to be so much bad news? What is it about this one that attracts me to them?" That the church
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.080]   will become a place where people might be drawn towards it. Not because we're trying to be relevant
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.880]   and cool to everybody else around us, but because we're carrying something in us of the death and
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.360]   resurrection of Jesus. And we know that this different spirit means that we're invited to
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.440]   living a new humanity. That actually the Christian faith is the only faith that declares that we are
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.040]   made new. And therefore, because we're made new, we're released into the beauty of being the human
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.400]   that we had always been designed to be. And that maybe the call of the church is to stand up in
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.760]   this hour and say, "It should look a little bit like forgiveness and love and mercy and grace
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.520]   and power and transformation and healing and restoration and reconciliation and all of these
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.560]   things." That's the way we were designed to be. So last week, I took us to a story in the Old
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.360]   Testament, Numbers 13 and 14, where we see Moses send out the 12 spies into the promised land.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.000]   And the spies go out and they see the land, the land that God had promised them to receive. And
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.920]   I believe Hong Kong is our promised land. And they go out into that promised land, all the
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.160]   inheritances that God had for them. And they come back and they bring a report and 10 of them say,
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:16.080]   "We cannot conquer the inheritance God has provided for us." And two of them say, "No, we should,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.200]   for we can." And Jesus looks at those two, Caleb and Joshua, and he looks at the 10 and he says,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.120]   "These two carry in them a different spirit. And because they carry in them a different spirit,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.320]   I'm going to release them and their generations to conquer the inheritance before them. But these 10,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.960]   because they went into the promised land and did not see what I had put aside for them to see,
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:48.160]   and these 10 were so overshadowed by the work of the enemy, these 10 will not enter." And I think
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.480]   we as a church are standing in a moment where will we have a different spirit and inherit the land
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:02.560]   given to us, or will we find ourselves shrinking and dying in the wilderness? That's what this
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.760]   series is all about. We're going to take the next, this week and the next five to tell you about what
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:15.520]   a different spirit is all about through the life of Caleb and Joshua. And I want to start today
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:25.760]   with a question for you, and it's this, what do you see? Like, what do you really see?
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:34.000]   Like right now here in our culture and society and our city, right now here and what's going on in
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.680]   your life personally? What is it that you actually see? Because here's the reality,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.520]   what you see and how you interpret it will shape your reality in the world that you live in.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.360]   What you see and how you interpret it, how you come to perceive it and think about it will shape
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.320]   your reality and therefore the world in which you live. And I think the Holy Spirit is asking us
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.760]   as a church, will we look out into Hong Kong in this time, in this hour, and will we see
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.840]   what everybody else is seeing, or will we see something different? So let me ask you again,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:21.760]   what is it that you see? I want to open up the thought around what we should be seeing
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.840]   in our promised land by taking us to the beginning of this story in Numbers 13 this morning. Let me
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.640]   read this to you. It says, "The Lord said to Moses, 'Send some men to explore the land of Canaan,
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.800]   which I'm giving to the Israelites. From each of the ancestral tribes, send one of its leaders.'"
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.720]   And then from verse 3 onwards, it has a whole list of a bunch of leaders whose names I cannot
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:51.520]   pronounce and I will skip over. Then in verse 17, "When Moses sent them to explore Canaan,
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:57.440]   he said this," listen to this, "Go up through the Negev and onto the hill country. See what
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.880]   the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, or few or many. What
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.240]   kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.640]   unwalled or fortified? How is the soil? Is it fertile or is it poor? Are there trees on it or
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:21.200]   not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit from that land, for it was the season for the
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:27.360]   first ripe grapes. So they went up and they explored the land from the desert of Zin as far as Rohab,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.600]   to the Leob Hamath. They went up through the Negev and came to the Hebron, where Achamim and Shassai
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   and Talmai is, the descendants of Anak who lived there. Hebron had been built seven years before
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.240]   Zohan in Egypt." Getting some history this morning? Yeah, I have no idea either, don't worry.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.640]   "When they reached the valley of Escol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.320]   Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomine gramets and some figs.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:02.320]   That place was called the valley of Escol because there a cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:09.120]   was from there. At the end of 40 days, they returned from exploring the land." Moses is really
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.880]   wise. I mean, they're camped right here on the corner of the promised land. But rather than just
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.800]   go into that land with the armies and just go and suddenly kind of attack, he sends these 12 leaders
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.880]   from the tribes and he says, "Go and see what it is in the land." Note that it says here, "I want you to
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:36.880]   see what is in the land before you." I think this act of seeing what is in our land, particularly
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.280]   the land in which we are planted in at this time, is perhaps one of the most important things
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   that Christians should be doing in this time and in this hour. I believe actually one of the great
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.880]   spiritual disciplines we're invited into is the ability to take a look at what is happening around
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:00.000]   us. That we are invited with spiritual eyes to have a look at our culture, have a look at society,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   have a look at what's taking and see what it is that is taking place around us. That we might
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.200]   actually rise up as a people and take an account, see the land. I think we say this at the Vine
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.800]   quite a lot. Christians should be intelligent spiritual beings. That actually how we see the
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.160]   place is important. I think Christians should know what's going on in current affairs. I think we
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.120]   should be reading the newspaper. I think we should be educating ourselves about what is happening
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.960]   socially and politically. I think it's important for us to understand what social justice issues
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.800]   are at work in our neighborhood. We must see, not so that we can stand back from a distance and
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.440]   judge the reality of what we're seeing, so that we can actually discern what the Holy Spirit is doing
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:52.320]   amongst it. That we might see the realities of what's happening in our land and align ourselves
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.640]   to it. One of the great gifts of being a Christ follower, as Christ followers, we are invited to
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:06.400]   evaluate the fruitfulness of the land in which we are inheriting. And if Hong Kong is that land for
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:16.880]   us, what do you see? Are you with me? The problem is the church for many years has gotten really
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:22.160]   good at burying its head in the sand when it comes to the things that are happening around it.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.280]   We kind of label some things as spiritual and some things as not. And the things that we don't
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.440]   think are spiritual, we leave them aside. And the things that we think are spiritual, we magnify.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:39.360]   And I think God invites the church to open their eyes to see the wonder and the challenge of what
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:46.880]   is happening in the location they are planted in and to make a difference. So let me keep reading.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:56.400]   It says here that Moses says to them, "Do your best to bring back some fruit of the land."
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   See, I think this is beautiful. Moses tells them to go and see. And the question is,
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.120]   what is it that they're supposed to be seeing? He does mention, "Check out the fortified cities,
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.280]   check out those things, have a look at that." Yes. But actually the emphasis is on the land itself.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.360]   He says, "I want you to see whether that land is fertile. I want you to see whether there is good
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.120]   fruit in that land. I want you to see whether we can actually build our crops there. I want you to
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.840]   see whether there are trees there." I mean, the emphasis of God's people going into the land
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.240]   is not to actually look at the cities and see how fortified they are. The emphasis is,
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:35.920]   is the land as God promised us? Is it fertile, flowing with milk and honey? And so to prove that,
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.880]   I want you, if you can, when you're in that land, to bring back to us some of its fruits.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:48.000]   Bring back to us a cluster of its grapes that are in season so that we can understand what it is
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.320]   that we're about to inherit. Notice this, church. This is so important. I love what Moses is doing
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.840]   here. Notice he doesn't say this. He doesn't say, "Bring me back a schematic map of Jericho."
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.800]   Have you ever noticed that? That would be what I would have asked him to do.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.160]   Hey, spies, find out how fortified it is, how high it is. Get all the measurements and stuff
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.320]   so we know how to overcome the obstacles. He doesn't do that. He says, "Here's what I want
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.840]   you to do. I don't want you to bring back a map of the towns. I want you to bring back some of its
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:25.440]   fruits." Why? Because I want my people to taste the sweetness of what they're about to inherit.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:32.400]   I want you to pass around the fruit to Israel so Israel can take it and bite those grapes and feel
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.240]   that sweetness in their mouths and that sweetness, oh, that the taste of the grapes would become the
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:43.920]   fuel for their fight, that they would realize that the land is exactly as God has called them to do,
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.600]   that it is the one that is flowing with milk and honey. And because it is, oh, we taste and see
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.120]   that the Lord is good. And that gives us the confidence to step into that land knowing that
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:02.320]   it is ours. He wants them to taste and know that what they're about to conquer is just the thing
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.440]   that he has provided for them. And church, I think this is what church is all about. I think the
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.680]   reason why we gather together like this on a Sunday, whether it's in this room or watching
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.480]   right now online, the reason why we gather like this is so that we can taste and know that the
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.800]   Lord is good. So that we can come together and bite something of the fruitfulness of Jesus.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.360]   That we can remind ourselves of the taste, the sweetness of forgiveness, of his love and his
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.960]   mercy for each one of us together. That we can sing songs that declare his victory and his goodness.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:43.600]   Why? So that we can get full? No. So that the taste of his love and his sweetness might become
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:50.480]   the fuel for our conquering of our promised land. That it might actually be the reason when we leave
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.760]   here at the end of 90 minutes with our hearts dripping and our mouths sweet with the taste of
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:02.480]   Jesus, that we say, I want others in the city to know that taste. I want other people in this place
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.120]   to experience the beauty and the wonder of forgiveness and love and mercy. I have tasted
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.280]   and seen that the Lord is good with vine on a Sunday. I go on Monday with the offer to people.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:22.880]   Maranatha, come and see Lord Jesus. I listened to an interview with Jackie Pullinger this week. I
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.560]   love Jackie. And she said in her early twenties, she came to Christ and she came to realize that
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.440]   she had eternal life. And she says on this podcast, she's like, I was filled with such a fire
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.520]   because I knew what eternity was like. And I wanted others to experience it.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:47.680]   Do you see the grapes around you? Are you tasting them? The beauty is that when we gather,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.320]   we can feast together the sweetness of God, but not just so that we can consume in a holy huddle,
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.920]   but so that it fuels our desire to see others come to Jesus. Are you with me?
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:07.280]   So then notice what happens when they come back, having seen what they needed to see in the land.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.880]   Verse 26 says this, they came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.360]   in the desert of Paran. There they reported to them and the whole assembly and showed them the
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.720]   fruit of the land. They gave Moses this account. We went into the land to which you sent us,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.880]   and it does flow with milk and honey. Here it is some of the fruit, but the people who live there
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.480]   are powerful and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of the Anakhtar,
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.480]   the Amalekites live in the Negev, the Hittites, the Jebusites, the Amorites live in the hill
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.960]   country. The Canaanites live near the sea along the Jordan. Listen to the report.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.400]   They come back from their 40 days and they give two sides to the report. First of all,
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:54.240]   there is this beautiful fruit that's in the land. It is the way God had described it to it. It flows
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:00.240]   with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit. In other words, come and taste and see that the
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:07.760]   Lord is good. But there's this other thing in the land. It's not just the reality of God's promises.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:15.200]   There's this other thing in the land. The people there are really, really big and scary. I mean,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.920]   the people there are descendants from the Anakhtar. These are huge people. And so they come back and
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.760]   they provide this report. They say there are grapes and there are giants. In other words,
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.520]   there are the promises of God in the land and there is the problem in the land. And I want you
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.400]   to see something really important here. All 12 of them give that same report. It's easy for us to
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.040]   think that Caleb and Joshua didn't give that report. That Caleb and Joshua gave a separate
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.520]   report. That maybe actually Caleb and Joshua were sleeping in the camp the day that they went and
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.000]   spied out Jericho. Maybe they didn't see the fortified people and they didn't see the great
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.840]   giants in the land. No, no. All 12 of them, Caleb and Joshua included, come back and say,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:07.440]   "Grapes and giants, promises and a problem." So the difference wasn't in what they saw.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.640]   The difference was in how they perceived what they saw.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:19.680]   Keep with me, church. I want to talk to you a little bit about grapes and giants.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.480]   I went to Welcome and I got the largest grapes that I could find. These are pretty big grapes.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:31.280]   But I want you to notice something. Imagine if you've gone into the promised land and you come
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:39.520]   back with that. And this is the grapes. And the grapes represent the promise of the fertility of
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.400]   the land for generations and generations. I don't know about you, but the grapes look pretty feeble.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:51.520]   They look pretty small, don't they? But Caleb and Joshua understood what these grapes represented.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.720]   That although these grapes appear small and feeble and relatively insignificant,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:03.920]   what was behind them was massive and huge. That these were proof that the promises of God
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.800]   were good. And they were saying, "Hey, come and let us...
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.040]   Wow, that's really good actually.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:17.920]   Come and taste and know that the Lord is good."
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:27.840]   But there were giants in the land. And these giants were massive. I did the study of the
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.400]   Hebrew and I did some exegetical work this past week on this passage. And I noticed this, that
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:40.240]   giants by their very nature are giant. That took me hours of study. That should blow your mind. If
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:47.120]   you're taking notes, write that one down. Giants by their very nature are giant. They are the very
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.600]   opposite of what a grape is all about. You cannot get a greater contrast between the smallness
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:22:00.160]   and the relatively feebleness of a grape and these massive giants. The giants are large for a reason.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:06.720]   They're designed to be so big that they block out the light of hope for you. The giants represent
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:13.920]   the problems that are found in the land of God's promises. And they're big and they're scary and
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.760]   they're massive and they're designed that way to kind of make you think that the grapes are nothing.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.240]   You see, you need to understand that there are always going to be giants in the land of God's
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.520]   promises. And then the giants are designed by the enemy so that they would overshadow the fruitfulness,
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.360]   the promise of that land so much that we're tempted to give up on the inheritance altogether.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.840]   Come on, church. This is a strategy of the enemy. There's always going to be giants in the land
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:50.480]   of God's promises. And those giants will so overshadow what might appear on the surface,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:59.040]   something that is small and easy to give up on. Some of you right now, in your land,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:07.680]   there are really big giants there for you. And those giants for us sometimes are personal and private.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.160]   Things that are going on in our lives, maybe sin we're grappling with, maybe stuff that's just
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.040]   happened, things that we've done, mistakes we've made, massive. And they look and they seem so
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.960]   overwhelming to us. And then think that giants are not just this personal private thing, but giants
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:30.160]   are also this massive thing in society as well. And that collectively, not just personally and
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.440]   privately, but collectively, we're also dealing with some pretty major giants in our city in this
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:41.600]   time. And those things can be so loud and so overpowering to us. And we need to realize that
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:48.640]   giants are designed to distract us from the small, but more powerful promises of God.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.800]   And some of us are getting too distracted by those giants. Let me talk to you for a moment
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:03.040]   about what I call giant tactics. Hands up if you're on social media. The rest of you are lying.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:10.480]   Shouldn't lie in church. It's really bad. When I ask a question, you answer. No, just kidding.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.400]   We're all on social media, aren't we? Here's the reality of social media. Social media is giant
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:23.920]   tactics. It's somebody's opinion magnified as loudly and as big as possible, driven to you on
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:30.480]   your feed by algorithms on Facebook and Instagram and YouTube that pick up what your personal likes
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:36.160]   are and tries to create an echo chamber of opinions that all go to either try to teach you
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.960]   or to drive you to get you to spend differently, get you to think differently. It's all designed
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.000]   with these algorithms. It's giant tactics at work so that you would come to believe that the thing
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.280]   with the loudest voice that's repeated the most must be the thing that's true. Come on, church.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:01.440]   Elections are won by this. One of my favorite social commentators, Seth Godin, he put it this
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:06.960]   way. Let me read this to you. "These days, it is irrelevant if something is actually true or not.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.560]   What is relevant is whether it's believed or not. And that belief is directly related to the size
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:20.480]   in which the state of fact or opinion is repeated and consumed." Giant tactics. The bigger,
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.240]   the bolder, the louder, the more often, the more easily consumed, that becomes the things that
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:32.000]   people believe. Here's the reality. Those with a different spirit have the audacious belief that
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.720]   sometimes the truth of God comes to us in the size of grapes and not the size of giants. That usually
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.160]   the truth of God is revealed to us in small, imperceptible ways that the world might say,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.760]   "Plah, that's nothing. Look how feeble the church is." And we might say, "No, we're holding onto
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.160]   something that actually anchors us in the promises of a reality of a new creation."
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:02.080]   Jesus would say this, "You want to know what my kingdom's like? A mustard seed." It's not like a
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.480]   giant at all. It's a little bit like a mustard seed, the smallest seed in the whole of the
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.560]   garden. You want to know what my kingdom is really like? It's like a little piece of yeast in the
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:18.320]   giantness of dough. You want to know who I am and what I'm like? I'm the stone the builders rejected
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:24.880]   because it was too feeble and small, but on me will be the cornerstone of a new creation. You
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:31.040]   want to know how feeble the Christian faith is, how small compared to the giants? It's founded on a
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:38.960]   cross, an execution device that actually happened to the person that we believe then rose from the
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:46.800]   dead and conquered all things. Our faith in its very nature is grapes, not giants. And yet here's
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:55.440]   the problem. We're so overwhelmed by the giants. See, here's the great challenge for us. The great
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:02.320]   challenge for us as the church in this time in the city of Hong Kong is this, that we would claim
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.080]   to believe in grapes, but we'd actually end up listening more to the giants.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.480]   That we would allow the louder voices, the bigger voices to be the ones that determine our future
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.880]   rather than the small, beautiful, still voice. I love the how the scripture says,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:24.080]   "Would you hear the still small voice of God in amongst the howling wind of worldly opinion?"
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:33.040]   The 10 spies refused to listen to the small voice. They all came back, all 12 of them,
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.960]   two of them talking about grapes, 10 of them talking about giants. And here's what happens
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:46.080]   when we focus on giants in our lives. Let me show you this from verse 30. "Then Caleb silenced the
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:51.120]   people before Moses, and he said this, 'We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:57.440]   certainly do it.'" A different spirit. "But the men who had gone up with him said,
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.480]   'We can't attack these people. They're stronger than we are.' And they spread a report amongst
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.440]   the Israelites, a bad report about the land that they explored. And they said, 'The land we explored
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.280]   will devour all those living in it. All the people we saw there were of great size. Can you not see
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:22.080]   the giants? We are too feeble. We're not strong enough.'" Notice this, "We are not strong enough.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:29.840]   They are stronger than we are." Moses never sent the spies into the promised land to ask them to
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.600]   give an account of whether they feel strong enough to take the land. He never once says,
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.720]   "Go into the land, and I want you to see how you compare to the people of the land." He doesn't
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.680]   say, "Go into that place and give an account of yourself." No, he says, "Go into the land,
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   give an account of the situation of the land. Like, tell me about the promises of God. Have
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.320]   the promises of God come true? Are the promises of God going to be there for us? Tell me about
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:02.480]   His promises. I didn't ask you to compare yourself to the giants. When we compare ourselves to the
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:08.240]   giants, we're always going to come off feeling small, weak, and that we can't do it. They are
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   stronger than us." I want to bring a reality check. The giants in your life, they're stronger than you.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.000]   This is why it was important that Caleb and Joshua saw the giants.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.840]   I think as Christians, we think that we are guaranteed a giant-free life.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:33.600]   Just ask the early church whether they had a giant-free life. We're not guaranteed a giant-free
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   life. In fact, we should see the giants. The difference is what we perceive about the giants.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.640]   And Joshua and Caleb decided to perceive the grapes and the power of the promises over the
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.880]   fact of the reality of these scary giants. And that changed everything for them. And some of you in
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.640]   this room, you're allowing the giants to determine what your future is going to look like. And if
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:02.400]   that's true, then you are not living with a different spirit. And trust me, I know the giants
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:11.440]   are scary. I've experienced the giants myself. They are scary things. But I wonder whether together
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.200]   as a community, we might be able to stand with one another and magnify the sweetness of the grapes.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.080]   I want to taste and know that the Lord is good. When was the last time
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.960]   you bit the grape? Who would like a grape right now? Anyone want a grape?
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:34.480]   They're really good by the way. I washed my hands. I did actually wash my hands.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.600]   Anyone else want a grape? You're having one.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:47.920]   Okay, online, ready? This grape's coming for you. Watch this. Oh, oh no. Okay, all right, all right.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.760]   Okay, I'm going to stop throwing grapes around. Don't worry. But I wonder what it would be like
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.200]   if the church was a place where you came to know the sweetness and the goodness of God.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:08.320]   God never said to you, He never asked you whether or not that you're strong enough to do the thing
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.520]   that He's called you to do. God's never asked you whether or not you're strong enough to do
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.440]   the thing He's called you to do. See, it's not about your strength. It's about His promises.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.320]   And if the church can rise up on that, I believe we will walk in a different spirit right now in
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.240]   this time, in this season. Now, here's the second thing that happens. And I want you to see this
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.360]   because it's really important. They come and they don't just first say, "Hey, we're not strong
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.960]   enough." They then say this. And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about what they had
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:43.120]   explored. Here's the reality. When you let the giants speak to you, you will always turn good
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:49.600]   news into a bad report. If the giants are the ones that have the dominant voice, you will always take
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:55.680]   the good news, the inheritance of God, His promises, what He's doing and how He's alive, even
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.120]   the message of the gospel. And we'll have a way, we'll find a way of taking good news and turning
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:07.360]   it into a bad report. And so here's the 10. And I think this is what annoys God so much. He realizes
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.080]   that they're turning this good news, the promised land, into this bad report. And He says, "That's
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   not the way it should be, that I invite you as my people to actually bring a good report about the
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:24.320]   good news." The challenge is, so often I think as Christians, we go into our workplaces and we bring
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:29.360]   a bad report of the good news because we're not that different from everyone else. And we don't
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.320]   really believe in forgiveness. And we're actually bitter and angry ourselves. And we're cheating on
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.240]   our wives and we're doing all this thing. And we're just like living a normal life. But we come
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.680]   on Sunday and we celebrate the grapes, but we don't eat them the rest of the week. And the Lord
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:46.000]   sees that and He says, "You're like the 10, not the two. Is there a different spirit in you?"
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.960]   And would we hear, would we have ears to hear? Not like some condemnation, but actually an
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:33:00.080]   invitation into this reality of what life could truly be like, a different spirit. Would we taste
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.480]   the grapes again? And although that won't make those giants disappear, maybe we'll be shaping
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.240]   our lives on the thing that is an invitation. Look how Joshua and Caleb put it in verse 30.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.560]   When Caleb signed to the people before Moses, he said this, "We should go up and take possession
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.160]   of the land, for we certainly can do it." See, their attitude was, "We should, for we can."
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:29.440]   Right? We can because this is God's promises. So we should, for we can. But the 10 spies were
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:35.760]   basically, "We can't, so we won't." There's a completely different mindset based on whether
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:41.840]   they're perceiving the reality of the grace before them. We should, for we can, versus we can't,
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:48.640]   so we won't. And I wonder if I was honest with you today, which of these two are you living out?
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:56.960]   What kind of report is your life bringing about the good news of Jesus? Is it a,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:02.880]   "We should, for we can," report? Or is it a, "We can, so we won't," kind of report?
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.920]   And this invitation is so beautiful. "We should go up and take possession of the land,
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.280]   for we certainly can do it." See, here's the reality. The report that you believe
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:21.120]   will determine the future you experience. Come on, church. I'm almost finished. Relax.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:26.480]   The report you believe determines the future you will experience.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:34.080]   And some of you here, here's the reality. You have a perception issue. And because of that,
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:42.080]   you have a report issue. And that report issue is determining a future issue. It all starts with,
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:50.080]   "What do you see?" Are you just seeing the giants and their ferocity, their size and their expanse?
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:56.720]   Are you carrying in the reality of the shadow they create? Or are you grabbing a hold, even if it
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:03.360]   looks so small and imperceptible, that still small voice, that little mustard seed? Are you grabbing
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.160]   a hold of something and saying, "I know this looks so small compared to that, but I'm going to take
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:16.480]   faith here and believe that this is the thing that I'm called to carry in this time." That we might
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:23.440]   see that, encourage that amongst us, taste and know that the Lord is good, and walk with a
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:31.440]   different spirit in this hour. So I stand before you today, and I simply say this again. In your
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:40.560]   context, in your situation, with everything that's going on for you, what do you see? You'll see both
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:48.720]   grapes and giants. Which one are you going to perceive over the other? Could you stand with me?
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.520]   I want to pray for you.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:57.440]   Father, we are grateful for this moment.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.040]   Grateful that we stand before you, a church, called by your name.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:11.600]   And in this important moment of history,
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:20.800]   in this important hour of our city,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.640]   you're asking us, "What do we see?"
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.720]   You have not given up on this place, Lord.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:38.880]   This is our inheritance. What a gift. We're so grateful to be living in this city in this time.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:45.680]   So grateful to be called Christians in this moment, in this hour. Thank you, Lord.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.360]   And we don't want to be a church defeated.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:56.160]   We want to be a church alive with a different spirit of hope.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:04.800]   Offering to our city the reality of what it tastes like,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:15.200]   to being forgiven and redeemed and loved, reconciled, restored and renewed.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:21.360]   The Holy Spirit would say to you this morning, "Would you taste and know that I'm good once again?"
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:30.160]   And would that taste be in your mouths as you stand before the giants?
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:41.360]   Whether you just open your hands just where you are, if you feel comfortable to do so. You don't have to.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:47.760]   It's just part of our posture that we do here at the Vine, just to welcome the Holy Spirit in,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.160]   allow Him to speak to us again.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:38:04.000]   We stand together just, Lord, before your presence in this moment.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:11.840]   Lord, we recognize the giants in our lives. I want you to take a moment,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.040]   just allow the Holy Spirit to show you. Maybe you already know what your giants are.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:27.280]   But whatever it is that you would just experience, just see again those giants.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.760]   But in seeing them, you wouldn't be overwhelmed.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:36.560]   You would realize that they're not going to get the final say.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:45.680]   Now, despite those giants that you're aware of, God is here for you.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:52.560]   His promises are new every morning. Great is His faithfulness to you,
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:58.080]   for He is able to change every circumstance and situation.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:04.640]   And so in faith this morning, you come before the Lord with all of the issues and the problems
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.200]   and the challenges. And He says, "My son, my daughter, what do you see?
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:15.120]   Do you see all those giants? And are you listening to their voice?
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:21.440]   Are you allowing them to define your future? Or instead, do you see me?
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:28.160]   Do you see what I'm doing? Do you see how I'm restoring and renewing you?
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:34.960]   Do you see the hope that is still there? Do you see the love that you once lost or forgot about?
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:43.200]   Do you see it again? For some of you, your giants are things that you've done in the past.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.360]   Those giants loom over you, trying to define who you are in the present and your future.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.480]   I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying to anyone in this room, "That's the case.
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.160]   That's not... Your past does not determine your future."
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.840]   I feel like the Holy Spirit is saying, "There's freshness for you this morning."
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:08.080]   For some of you, it's been a while since you've tasted and known that the Lord is good.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.400]   I want you to take the time as we respond now just to invite Him to be with you,
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.640]   just to taste Him again. The sweetness of salvation, the beauty of forgiveness and mercy.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.400]   Allow that just to wash over you, forgiveness of your sin,
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.760]   strengthening of your hands for the work that He's called you to do.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.960]   Lord, we pray that grapes would burst forth in this room
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:40.080]   as we respond now to all that your Spirit is doing in this place.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   Thank you for this.
