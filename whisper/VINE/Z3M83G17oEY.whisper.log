[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   This is the third week of Advent.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.600]   We are 10 days away from Christmas.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.700]   How are you guys doing?
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.240]   Too many parties already?
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.480]   You're like, oh good, too many parties, too many wine.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.840]   Like, oh, I'm so tired.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.120]   Too many parties?
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.000]   Anybody went to more than like three Christmas parties
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.840]   already?
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.460]   Well, yeah, staff and small group
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.280]   and our daughter's school's Christmas parties were three.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.340]   Anyway, party is great, party is good.
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.880]   Nobody believes a pastor is saying that, hey, come on,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.440]   parties are biblical, all right?
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.040]   You see parties in the Bible.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.940]   As long as we are doing, you know,
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.360]   we're celebrating for the right thing,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.060]   we're not getting wasted, it's biblical, come on.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.760]   Do you know that when we get saved,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.280]   there's a party going on in heaven?
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.900]   You know that, right?
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.380]   So celebration, it's good, it's biblical.
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.400]   And in fact, celebration, it's a vital part of life,
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.560]   it's so important that what we're doing here
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.880]   every Sunday morning or afternoon,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820]   it's a celebration in itself, right?
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.960]   The songs we sing, the way we, you know,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.040]   the way you clap, the way we do what we do,
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.800]   it's part of a celebration, amen?
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   I'm like, okay, half of you, half agree with me, okay.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.160]   All right, I still love you.
[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.860]   Anyway, so Christmas is coming,
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.660]   I'm sure you've been hearing a lot of music going on.
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.560]   We did sing some Christmas songs,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.360]   and in the car, I play Christmas songs,
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.960]   and fun fact, my daughter asked me to play a Christmas song
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.760]   a couple weeks ago, said I want Christmas song in the car.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.960]   I was about to reach for, you know,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.920]   jingle bells or something, and she said,
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.620]   I want last Christmas.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.620]   [audience laughing]
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.040]   Yeah, so you know the music taste of my daughter now.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.840]   Anyway, yeah, music, it's so beautiful,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.880]   and we sang a lot of Christmas songs,
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.080]   a lot of the songs we do, they are for Christmas only.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.980]   Worship team, we have a special set list for Christmas.
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.640]   And in fact, in the Bible story or in the Bible narrative,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.280]   when you look into it, in the gospel of Luke,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.440]   those chapters talking about the birth of Jesus,
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.120]   there were indeed some songs inside.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.120]   Today, we're going to talk about one of them,
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.680]   and that song, it's by Mary, Jesus' mother.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.820]   Let me just read that to you in fact here.
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.640]   Sorry, this is what the water is for, sorry.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.500]   So we'll start from Luke chapter one, verse 46.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.200]   There it says, Mary said, my soul glorifies the Lord,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.600]   and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.160]   for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant,
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.520]   me basically, from now on all generations
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.920]   will call me blessed, for the mighty one
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.760]   has done great things for me, holy is his name.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.120]   His mercies extend to those who fear him
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.360]   from generation to generation.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.880]   He has performed mighty deeds with his arms.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.440]   He has scattered those who are proud
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.920]   in their inmost thoughts.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.360]   He has brought down rulers from their thrones
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.440]   but has lifted up the humble.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.740]   He has filled the hungry with good things
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.400]   but has sent the rich away empty.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.600]   He has helped his servant Israel,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.940]   remembering to be merciful to Abraham
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.800]   and his descendants forever,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.320]   just as he promised our ancestors.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.200]   So you probably would have heard of this before.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.440]   Some composer, they even use these words, compose music,
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.400]   put a soundtrack to these words,
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.840]   and it becomes songs that we would sing
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.920]   throughout different centuries of the church.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.160]   And we've been calling this song
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.880]   or this passage the Magnificat.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.640]   It comes from the very first word in this passage
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.560]   in the Latin Bible.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.040]   So this, oh, it's on the screen, thank you.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.400]   This Magnificat, it's a beautiful pieces,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.820]   but if you start reading it,
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.640]   and if you are a Bible reader,
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.840]   you like to read, for example,
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.400]   the Psalms in the Old Testament when you can't sleep,
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.360]   or maybe you can sleep, you just love reading the Bible,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.480]   you start reading it,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.280]   you find a little bit of similarities.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.720]   This Psalm started with, you know,
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.080]   my soul glorifies the Lord,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.240]   and my spirit, and my spirit does what?
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.860]   My spirit will also, you know, sing in praises.
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.880]   My spirit is also worshiping him, worship God, my Savior.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.240]   And this kind of remind you of something
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.320]   like Psalm 103, right?
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.880]   You know, bless the Lord, oh my soul, something like that.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.640]   And if we continue to read,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.320]   and we would see this Psalm,
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.680]   actually it follows a certain format.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.280]   This format in the Old Testament Psalm,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.520]   one of the hymns we call it,
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.560]   we call this kind of Psalm a Thanksgiving Psalm,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.320]   a Thanksgiving poem.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.200]   And it always starts with a call to worship,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.960]   or a call to praise God,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.720]   or in itself just a statement to praise God.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.440]   Like what I just said, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.600]   It's a statement calling myself to praise God.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.400]   This is what Mary is doing here.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   My soul, my soul, my soul glorifies the Lord.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.000]   And it's like one of these old Psalms that we normally read.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.600]   And when Mary says my soul and my spirit,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.720]   she is actually saying my very being, my whole self,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.120]   I'll be here to praise God, to worship him,
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.200]   to love him, to bring glory to him.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.920]   And that's what it is.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.320]   But this is what we do nowadays as well.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.360]   We have songs like this, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.460]   And then we sing a lot of songs every Sunday.
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.500]   We do this every single week.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.640]   We have praise songs.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.460]   We praise God whenever we come into church.
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.160]   So praise is part of the routine,
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.080]   the activities that we do here.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.440]   And we can just follow the screen.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.620]   There are lyrics right now, and we just follow,
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.040]   and we sing something.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.460]   Sometimes you feel your heart is resonating,
[00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.080]   or your heart really, wow, it really makes my heart beat,
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.800]   you know, when I see those lyrics, when I'm singing those.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.520]   Sometimes you're like, oh, okay, that's all right.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.760]   But for Jewish worshipers, whenever they're worshiping,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.720]   yes, this call to worship, this statement of worship,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   yes, it's important,
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.280]   but they always have the next part in their Psalm.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.500]   And they always have a word,
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.560]   a transition word that sounds like,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.120]   for, I bless the Lord, I love you, Lord,
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.480]   for, you have done certain things for me.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.600]   They always put a reason.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.920]   They always put a testimony of their own story
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.760]   to that Psalm.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.280]   They're always telling you, I'm here to praise God.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.800]   I'm here to worship Him
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.960]   because something He has done for me in my life.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   In other words, praise, there's always a reason for it.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.200]   And a joy in our lives, there is always a source for our joy.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.260]   Let me say that again.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.860]   There's always a reason for our praise,
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.200]   and there's always a source for our joy.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.120]   That's what the Old Testament Psalms,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.040]   and we see how people worship.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.240]   That's what they're trying to do.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.080]   They're saying, my praise is not empty.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.360]   There's always a reason behind to back it up.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.220]   That's my question for us today.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.740]   I'm wondering when we walk through these doors,
[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.440]   when we come and praise God,
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.980]   is there a reason behind our worship?
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.200]   We can put that slide for those words just now.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.180]   Do we have a reason for our worship?
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.900]   When we walk in, do we feel, wow, yes,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.600]   God, I'm praising you today because of this or that?
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.300]   Or sometimes, does it feels like
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.940]   we're just going through the motions?
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.020]   And I know sometimes we all do that.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.300]   We all go through the motions.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.340]   Maybe we're half awake, or maybe, you know,
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.980]   for me, it was Manchester United
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.060]   that suffered a huge defeat last night.
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.540]   When I come in on Sunday morning,
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.340]   oh yeah, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.180]   [audience laughs]
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.180]   [sighs]
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.020]   Like, oh my gosh.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.860]   So sometimes that happens, but I want to reassure you
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.300]   that if sometimes you don't feel like saying those words,
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.460]   you don't feel you're totally connected with the lyrics,
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.560]   it's not a sin, I just want to tell you.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.260]   But that also shows us that we're missing out on something.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.840]   It's an omission.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.460]   We're missing out on something
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.540]   because when these people, when the people of God
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.940]   in the Bible, when they're praising God,
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.820]   they said there's always a reason.
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.900]   I can always think of something
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.980]   that He has done for me in my life.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.660]   And unless your God stopped working in your life,
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.060]   unless your God no longer exists in your life,
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.380]   otherwise, there should always be a reason.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.420]   There should always be something
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.780]   that He's doing in your life that gives you,
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.660]   that brings you to praise, brings you to worship Him.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.280]   And so here, when we look at the song of Mary,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.500]   the Magnificat, we can see that this song,
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.220]   she starts with, you know, my soul glorifies the Lord,
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.340]   I bless Him, I praise Him,
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.680]   and for He has done great things for me.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.400]   But she didn't just stop there.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.660]   She didn't just stop with her own personal story,
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.160]   what God has done for me.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.600]   She goes on and on and on to talk about
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.940]   the character of God.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.260]   And throughout this song, you would see God is mighty,
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.660]   He's powerful, but He's also merciful.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.220]   He said He will have mercy on those who fear Him,
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.860]   like He draws near to us, that He will be good to us.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.020]   He knows what we're going through
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.180]   and He will not abandon us.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.620]   So God is powerful, He is merciful.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.780]   But then at the same time,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.860]   she also shows us that we have a God who is just.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.020]   In Him we find justice.
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.020]   And justice in the biblical world,
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.100]   it means God is gonna lift up the humble
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.280]   and He's gonna humble those who are proud.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.860]   Something we explored in a previous sermon series
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.000]   and you can go back and listen to that again
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.660]   and that's our God, that's what He's doing.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.980]   And so when we look at Mary's song,
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.420]   we see that she starts with calling us
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.100]   and calling herself to worship
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.420]   and then she moved on to giving a very reason
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.300]   why she's worshiping God right now,
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.340]   why she's praising with her own story
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.580]   what God has done for her.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.580]   And she talks about what God has done for all her people,
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.740]   how that shows God's character.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.880]   And we see that there's a great reversal
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.940]   that we have seen, what we talked about.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.900]   He will bring down those rulers from their thrones,
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.620]   He will lift up the humble.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.060]   And we see that's what God's gonna do.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.060]   For Mary, that's something she experienced very personally
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.260]   because she knows she was a nobody.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.380]   She's from a nobody town called Nazareth
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.300]   and she's a nobody there.
[00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.820]   If God choose to come into this world as a baby,
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.340]   probably He should have choose someone more prominent.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.580]   Someone more like her relative Elizabeth.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.900]   Or maybe when she was a bit younger
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.360]   'cause Elizabeth is a bit old now.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.540]   But somebody who looks perfect, who has a perfect record,
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.240]   who comes from a great family,
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.040]   maybe those people should be the ones
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.340]   who carry this baby Jesus or the Messiah.
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.700]   But Mary knew, wow, God is gonna come here
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.900]   and turn everything upside down.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.500]   And it's not just for Mary, it's not just for herself,
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.180]   that's for the entire world because the kingdom of God
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.280]   that this baby inside of her womb, Jesus,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.700]   He came to establish is an upside down kingdom.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.320]   Is to reverse the world order,
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.060]   is to turn things upside down.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.100]   And that's what Mary was trying to communicate to us
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.920]   in this song.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.020]   It's beautiful, it's biblical.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.620]   Like we read about that,
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.740]   Jesus talk about this kind of stuff.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.400]   But today I wanna draw your attention
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.260]   to one particular line of this song.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.300]   Mary says this from now on,
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.060]   "All generations will call me blessed."
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.380]   I know we're here sitting in 2024.
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.140]   We look back this story in the Bible from 2000 years ago,
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.660]   I'm like, yeah, of course, Mary, of course you're blessed.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.700]   Come on, you're the mother of Jesus.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.860]   And in some areas, there are people who would even like,
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.500]   say prayers to you.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.000]   And you're in a place where everybody celebrates you
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.020]   at least every Christmas we talk about you.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.780]   I remember as a young kid when I was in my church,
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.720]   I was a four or five year old kid.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.900]   They made us do a Christmas play
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.580]   and I think I was Joseph
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.980]   and I learned about Joseph and Mary there
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.180]   and I was like four or five.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.580]   Even young kids know about her.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.540]   Of course you are blessed, what are you talking about?
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.220]   Of course that's true.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:14.220]   If we look at that story from a 2024 perspective.
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.440]   But today I wanna bring us back to the first century.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.300]   I wanna bring us back to the time and space
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.340]   where this story actually happened.
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.080]   You know that this story happened about 2,000 years ago
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.440]   in Middle East in an area called Judea.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.160]   So Jewish people, they have their own customs,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.660]   they have their own laws,
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.700]   they have their own religious laws.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.280]   When Mary, when the angel one day show up to her
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.260]   and say, hey, you know what, Mary,
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.540]   you're gonna get pregnant because God loves you.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.680]   You're gonna get pregnant.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.340]   Yes, I know you're not married yet,
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.620]   but don't worry, you're gonna get pregnant.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.620]   What?
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.860]   Don't worry, you're gonna get pregnant, okay?
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.300]   Because God loves you, he favors you,
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.540]   you're gonna get pregnant.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:04.060]   If I were Mary, honestly I would freak out.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.740]   I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:06.660]   Like, oh no!
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:12.500]   Because like some parts of the world,
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.860]   maybe in a city among the more Chinese culture
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:20.860]   is still true, if you're unmarried and you're pregnant,
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.840]   it's actually a big deal.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.220]   In the Jewish culture, any unmarried pregnancy,
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.260]   it's considered a sin.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.220]   In the Jewish law, it's actually punishable by death.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.300]   Of course, during that time,
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.980]   nobody really does that anymore,
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.780]   but it's still a big sin.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.460]   So you get rejected by your husband or your fiance,
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.460]   you get rejected by your own family, your own father,
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.340]   and those synagogue leaders, those Pharisees,
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.300]   they will brand you as a sinner.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.700]   Sounds familiar, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.940]   You will become a sinner,
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.700]   you will become an outcast of the society from now on.
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.780]   Nobody want to do business with you,
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.060]   nobody want to talk to you,
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.820]   nobody want to stay near you.
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.820]   People, when they see you, oh, okay, hi, I'm sorry.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.640]   They will just run away from you.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.160]   Nobody would want to be with you anymore.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:16.540]   That's what we're talking about here.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.740]   If you said, you know, mission impossible,
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.780]   you say yes to this mission,
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.780]   if you say yes to it,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.180]   you're gonna be an outcast for the rest of your life.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.620]   Nobody is gonna have,
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.460]   won't have anything to do with you.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.460]   That was what Mary facing during that time.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.500]   And so when this angel showed up,
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.980]   when the angel broke the news to her,
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.700]   when she said, I'm the Lord's servant,
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.260]   there is a prize there, there's a huge prize indeed.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.100]   And today I want to continue to read with us
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.420]   a few verses before that song.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.100]   I'm gonna read from Luke chapter one, verse 39.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.100]   It says, so 38, that's the end of the angel,
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.060]   Gabriel bringing that message to her.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.020]   Verse 39 says this, at that time Mary got ready
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.380]   and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.620]   where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.300]   So Mary, she lives in Nazareth in Galilee
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.620]   and she's going to this place, a hill country of Judea.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:29.620]   That's about 80 to 110 kilometers, give or take.
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.740]   If you start your journey here from Yuen Long
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.340]   and walk for 110 kilometers,
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.100]   you probably, one of the possible places
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.420]   you will end up in, it's Guangzhou.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.060]   Of course now, as Hong Kongers,
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.740]   we take the high speed rail,
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.140]   you'll be there in less than an hour.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.740]   But we're talking about 2,000 years ago.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.340]   We're talking about this rural area
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.420]   so she would have to walk all the way there
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.580]   and she could only take this journey by herself.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.140]   And we're seeing that she's actually not in a good mood
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.020]   to do a road trip.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.780]   We think, oh yeah, there's a relative,
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.740]   let's go and visit her.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.300]   That's what we do sometimes, right?
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.580]   Okay, I'm going back home to see my family.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.540]   See you in a few weeks, bye, that's Christmas,
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.740]   that's what everybody does.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.220]   That's not what Mary is doing.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.380]   She's not doing a road trip to see her friends
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.260]   or relatives or family.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.820]   It's not a pleasant trip for her.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.100]   Maybe, in fact, while she was traveling,
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.180]   she's asking herself a lot of questions.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.020]   She got a lot of things going on in her mind.
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.580]   Things like, what am I gonna say to my family
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.620]   when they find out eventually?
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.220]   What should I tell Joseph?
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.340]   Will he even believe me?
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.780]   Will he even try to listen to me if I tell him,
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.580]   I got a baby and that baby is from the Holy Spirit?
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.980]   Will he even listen to me?
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.100]   You see, when Mary was on her way to see Elizabeth,
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.460]   she probably might be filled with confusion and questions
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.260]   and different emotions all mixed up inside of her.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.980]   That shocking news from the angel
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.540]   would probably have disoriented her life
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.620]   or even turned her life upside down.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.340]   As a teenager, she had to face a challenge
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.900]   that she would have never imagined before.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.620]   As I was reading this story,
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.060]   I was actually wondering in my head,
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.620]   did Mary take this trip before or after
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.260]   the angel Gabriel appeared to Joseph in Matthew 1?
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.980]   If you know the story in Matthew 1,
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.660]   the angel actually appeared to Joseph
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.420]   to tell him the same message
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.660]   because before the angel visited Joseph,
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.420]   he was actually thinking about divorcing Mary.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.020]   Saying, sorry, this is over.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.660]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.740]   I don't understand.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.380]   You mean you're pregnant?
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.020]   We're not married.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.260]   How can this happen?
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.780]   You must be with another man.
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.620]   Sorry, Mary, I like you.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.260]   You're cute.
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.340]   You're great.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.020]   And you're beautiful.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.100]   But you're pregnant.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.380]   So I'm sorry, this is the end.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.900]   And the Bible says he wants to do it quietly.
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.500]   He wants to say goodbye, that's it.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.260]   Let's break up last Christmas.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.940]   I gave you my heart, but that's it, all right?
[00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:30.020]   So my guess is, my guess,
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.020]   the Bible didn't say this timeline,
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.500]   but my guess is that this trip
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.580]   was even before Joseph found out.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.900]   Because number one, there's no ultrasound in those days.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.060]   And number two, for a girl even to find herself pregnant,
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.420]   to confirm her pregnancy,
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.900]   I have two kids, so I know.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.700]   All right, it takes at least like a month
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.220]   or a few more weeks when your period stopped
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.900]   and you start to wonder and you check.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.420]   I don't know how they do it before like all these.
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.580]   Yeah, anyway, I don't know about technology
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.660]   in first century, but it would at least take a few weeks
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.700]   or at least a few months for her to find out.
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.980]   But she took this trip immediately to visit Elizabeth.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.020]   So perhaps she hasn't even thought
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.100]   about how to talk to Joseph yet.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.020]   She's just, you know, who's just raising herself her heart,
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.740]   like what am I gonna do, what am I gonna say,
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.020]   what am I gonna tell him?
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.700]   So this is where Mary was.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.500]   Maybe she hasn't even thought about how to talk to him.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.140]   Maybe, you know, maybe, maybe, maybe.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.220]   And yeah, of course, if you read the Bible
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.180]   in the Old Testament, there's a prophecy
[00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.660]   in one of the prophets, Isaiah,
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.340]   it says there will be a virgin giving birth to a kid.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.740]   If you take, if Mary take this prophecy
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.540]   to Joseph, to his family, I have imagined that,
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.540]   you know, as a father myself, I do believe in God's power
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:59.180]   that could be a virgin giving birth to a child,
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.660]   but that will not be my daughter.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.460]   As a brother myself, I could totally believe
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.700]   that by God's power, there could be a virgin
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.900]   giving birth to a child, just not my sister.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.220]   As someone's ex-fiance, 'cause I'm a husband,
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.620]   as an ex-fiance, I could believe
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.340]   that God could miraculously make a virgin,
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.340]   you know, give birth to a baby, but just not my fiance.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.700]   You get what I mean?
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.980]   Yeah, there could be a miracle,
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.180]   but that miracle wouldn't be in my home.
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.260]   This is what Mary was facing, the rejection, the scandal,
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.660]   the way people look at her,
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.420]   the way people are rejecting her,
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.540]   don't wanna have anything to do with her.
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.020]   That's what Mary was facing.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.460]   Being an unmarried, pregnant teenager
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.260]   in the first century Jewish society
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.220]   could be the worst nightmare.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.740]   It brings shame to her, it brings shame to her family.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.780]   She'll be rejected by Joseph, by her father,
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.820]   by her synagogue community, and for the rest of her life,
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.820]   she's gonna be branded as a sinner.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.980]   And because in the first century Jewish community,
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.580]   you know what women, their social status,
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.180]   their economic status is totally dependent
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.340]   on her family or her husband.
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.740]   And so if she's unmarried, she's pregnant,
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.820]   she didn't just mess up her social life or her self-esteem.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.860]   We're talking about her livelihood,
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.660]   we're talking about every possible area
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.020]   in her life will be affected.
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.260]   So if there's a simple way to describe
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.780]   the situation Mary was in,
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.940]   she was simply in a crisis with her unmarried pregnancy.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.940]   And not only that, later because of this child of hers,
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.980]   after this child was born,
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.580]   you know, she was rejected by other people as well
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.780]   when she was, because of this pregnancy,
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.220]   when she was in Bethlehem,
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.260]   when she was supposed to follow her fiance to his hometown,
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.660]   they were rejected.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.300]   They couldn't even find a place to stay
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.420]   and they had to give birth in an animal shelter.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   And after this child was born,
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.940]   because this child was being hunted down,
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.620]   they end up, this family end up as refugees
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.860]   in a country they had never lived in.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.780]   They become refugees.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.540]   And not only that, when this kid finally, you know,
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.180]   grew up, she had to watch him being tortured to death,
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.180]   horrible death.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.260]   She had to watch it with her own eyes.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.180]   And if we add all these things up and you tell me,
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.900]   from now on, all generations will call me blessed,
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.900]   I think that doesn't quite add up to the math.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.700]   If you're telling me that's how God
[00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.500]   is going to bless me or bless you,
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.020]   I don't know about you.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.860]   Probably I'll say pass.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.900]   I don't want to be blessed like that.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.340]   I don't want to be blessed in a way
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.420]   that I'll have to go through pain,
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.180]   I have to go through suffering,
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.700]   I have to see a loved one die,
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.820]   I have to be rejected many, many times.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.300]   I don't even know if that's blessing.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.660]   How about you?
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.980]   What do you see as blessings of God in your life?
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.100]   Is it possible in this scenario,
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.780]   if we look at it and we think about our lives,
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.380]   would there be any scenario that God is actually blessing us
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.220]   but we simply miss it because we thought,
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.020]   no way, God cannot bless someone like that.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.620]   Would we be passing God's blessings without knowing
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.380]   and said, sorry, I don't want this, I don't want this,
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.100]   but in fact, it's God's blessing in our life.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.420]   But what changed?
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.940]   Like if she's going through so much suffering,
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.700]   if she's going through so much trauma or so much stress
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.060]   while she was on her way to see Elizabeth,
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.820]   what has changed in that house?
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.940]   That Mary suddenly said, you know what,
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.580]   from now on, all generations are gonna call me blessed.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.580]   So why don't we find out what happened
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.940]   in that house of Zachariah and Elizabeth?
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.500]   I'm gonna read from verse 41.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.780]   When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting,
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.740]   the baby, John the Baptist inside her womb leaped
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:27.540]   and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.500]   In a loud voice, she exclaimed,
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.100]   blessed are you among women,
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.420]   blessed is the child you will bear.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.580]   But why am I so favored
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.740]   that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.820]   As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears,
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.260]   the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.700]   Blessed is she who has believed
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.940]   that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.540]   It's beautiful here, it says,
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.780]   Elizabeth, she was filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.580]   and being inspired by the Holy Spirit,
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:06.460]   she recognized who the baby in the womb was.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.580]   It's interesting because the Holy Spirit
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.420]   has always been the one that points us to Jesus.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.260]   The Holy Spirit has always been the one
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.060]   that reveals Jesus to us.
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.980]   This is the first person being filled
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.460]   with the Holy Spirit in the New Testament
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.220]   and her first reaction, she recognized Jesus.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.660]   Oh, that's Jesus.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.460]   Oh, that's the Messiah.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.020]   That's the mother of the Messiah,
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.060]   the mother of my Lord coming to me.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.780]   She recognized.
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.580]   And because she knew who the baby was,
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:43.180]   so she said those words, blessed are you among women.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.660]   In today's terms, you are like not greatest of all time,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.860]   you're the most blessed of all time.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.660]   So if you can come up with a meme like that,
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.620]   that's Mary and she's the most blessed of all time.
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.620]   She's the most blessed woman of all time.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.940]   That's what she meant.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.580]   And what?
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.860]   All right, memes, right?
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.260]   Okay, and said, oh yeah, this will be my Lord.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.540]   And so Mary, Mary, we have to look at Mary.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.780]   She has experienced this blessing,
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.980]   but there are actually, according to the words of Elizabeth,
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.740]   this blessings, there are two parts.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.580]   So the first part, of course, is that baby,
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.260]   is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.140]   The Holy Spirit came and she become pregnant
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.260]   and that's her blessing
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.580]   because of the baby inside of her womb.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.980]   That's why she's blessed.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.740]   But you know that part, she doesn't have to do a thing.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.860]   She just sit there, do nothing and I'm pregnant.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.940]   She doesn't have to do anything.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.700]   She's completely passive in this part of the blessing.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.620]   But then Elizabeth also talk about an active part
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.420]   in this blessing.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.420]   She said, blessed is the one who believed
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.700]   that the Lord will fulfill his promises to her.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.980]   In other words, when the angel came,
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.420]   Mary, she believed.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.620]   She believed the promises of God,
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.340]   no matter how difficult it seems,
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.380]   no matter how crazy it sounds,
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.660]   she believed that God is gonna do something.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.940]   And that belief, that trust, that faith
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.540]   becomes a blessing in her life.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.940]   And so those who continue to believe,
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.260]   who continue to trust,
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.460]   who continue to hold on to God's promises,
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.220]   just like Mary, they will be blessed.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.580]   But this is very important here.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:32.060]   When Elizabeth declared these words over her,
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.540]   she was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.820]   I don't know if you've ever been in a room
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.140]   or in a situation where someone was filled
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.420]   with the Holy Spirit and they start just praying for you.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.420]   They're just speaking over your life.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.980]   They start prophesying over you.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.340]   I've had that in a Zoom call before.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.340]   I've had that like face to face before.
[00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.180]   I've had that in many different scenarios before.
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.460]   You know, what I learned is that when someone
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.820]   is filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.140]   and they're speaking life over me
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.940]   or speaking God's words over me,
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.500]   the only thing I felt was,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.220]   wow, I have a direct encounter with God.
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:12.980]   I think Mary, when she left Nazareth,
[00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.500]   she was totally puzzled.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.300]   She was totally confused.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.620]   But when she arrived in that house,
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.180]   when Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.420]   and started prophesying over her,
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.060]   I think she had an encounter with God
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.260]   and things start to change.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.460]   The confusion was gone.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.500]   And she was like, now I know my soul glorifies the Lord
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:39.180]   and now generations will call me blessed.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.500]   Whatever is gonna happen to me, I know I'm blessed.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.180]   A visitation of the Holy Spirit, a word,
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.900]   a ministry from the Holy Spirit changed the entire scenario.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.980]   And I'm wondering if, you know,
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.740]   we need that in our lives.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.100]   We need the Holy Spirit to speak to us
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.460]   either directly or through someone, speak over us
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.700]   so that something inside of our lives,
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.700]   maybe some strongholds, maybe some previous hurts,
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:14.460]   maybe something's stuck inside us could be changed.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.900]   Some of us, some of you here have heard of my story
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.860]   or more correctly, my mother's story.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.940]   She found out she had cancer
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.500]   not long after she gave birth to me.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   So I was still very young.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.340]   And some of you knew that she passed away
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.140]   eventually because of cancer.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.340]   But what I didn't share with you all was that
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.220]   my mother actually passed on my third birthday.
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:46.140]   I remember as a kid on Tomb Sweeping Festival
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.220]   or those double nines like Chinese festival
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.740]   will go tomb sweeping.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.180]   I remember arriving at my mom's gravestone
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.460]   and looking at a date.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.460]   That date was supposed to be my birthday.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.660]   It's supposed to be a date for celebration.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.500]   But then that date has ever since been turned
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.180]   into a date for mourning.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.660]   In fact, when I was young,
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.060]   my family never celebrated my birthday with me
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.140]   on the actual date.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.060]   Well, my birthday was right after a major holiday.
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.180]   So we always just, you know, do it by the way
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.060]   and let's just celebrate, have a party during the holiday.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.780]   But we never do it on my actual birthday.
[00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.020]   Ever since I was young, I thought when I look at that day,
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.540]   I always approach that day with mourning,
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.460]   with sadness, with, oh, this is a bad day.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.940]   I don't like this date.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.820]   Like, this is so bad.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.620]   Like, 'cause my mom left the world
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.260]   and she lost her life on this date.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.620]   Fast forward, I remember on my 18th birthday,
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.660]   I was just praying and worshiping at home.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.140]   I was just, you know, singing songs to praise God
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.740]   and I was praying and somehow,
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.980]   I don't know why I thought about this part, my mom.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.460]   And the Holy Spirit just came into my bedroom
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.660]   and he started speaking to me.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.300]   He said, "Chapman, you know what?
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.780]   "15 years ago this date,
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.380]   "yes, it was the day that your mom passed away.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.580]   "But that was actually the day
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.940]   "that she finished running her good race.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.500]   "It was the day she finished fighting the good fight.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.700]   "It was the day that she has kept her faith
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.580]   "and now she would receive the crown of life."
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:29.580]   And the entire heaven was cheering for her.
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:34.060]   That's what happened 15 years ago.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.180]   And if there's something you need to react to,
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.940]   if there's a proper reaction, that will be celebration.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.980]   And the Spirit just came upon me
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.620]   and I remember for the first time,
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.060]   I started celebrating that.
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.140]   Not just my birthday, not just my birth,
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.940]   but I started celebrating the end of my mother's life
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.620]   on my birthday.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.180]   Because I know what her life actually meant,
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.580]   not just to me or my family,
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:04.940]   but to all those people she helped during her time.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.860]   I know she fought this good fight,
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.300]   so it's a time worth celebrating
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.940]   because that's the day she said,
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.420]   it's kind of like Olympics,
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.140]   she got on stage and somebody gave her a medal,
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.060]   that's the exact moment.
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.500]   If there's something I should do,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.860]   I should be standing there giving her a round of applause.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.900]   And that day, the Holy Spirit just came and spoke to me
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.940]   and changed my heart.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:35.060]   And ever since, for the next almost 20 years now,
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.660]   yeah, I do celebrate that.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.940]   I do celebrate my birthday,
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.260]   but I celebrate the day my mom,
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.140]   we say graduated from this life
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.820]   or she finished her mission here
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.380]   and she entered into eternity.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.540]   That's beautiful.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:58.580]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.820]   Thank you.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:06.220]   As I was preparing the message for today,
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.740]   I felt that's what the Holy Spirit wants to do with us today.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:14.140]   Perhaps some of us,
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:17.100]   we are struggling with certain things in our lives,
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.300]   perhaps there are wounds He wants to heal,
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.700]   there are strongholds He wants to take down
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.940]   and there are things He wants to speak to us directly
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.460]   or maybe through somebody else,
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.580]   He wants to speak life into us.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:37.980]   I do wanna give us room and space and time
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.260]   just to be in the presence of God,
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.060]   in the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:50.020]   When Mary left Nazareth, I think she was quite puzzled,
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.340]   I think she was quite nervous,
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.740]   but that encounter with God in Zechariah,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.980]   in Elizabeth's house, I think it changed her.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.420]   I think one encounter with God can do a lot in our lives
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.980]   and I believe that's what God wants to do this morning here
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.500]   or this afternoon here with us.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.420]   This is what we're gonna do,
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.300]   we're just gonna, you can sit, you can stand,
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:17.540]   we're just gonna worship God for a bit
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:21.140]   and then later I'll give us some instructions
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:22.620]   on how we're going to pray.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.460]   So if you wanna stand, you can stand,
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.340]   if you wanna sit, you can sit,
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.300]   but we're just going to worship right now.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.700]   (soft music)
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:59.500]   Holy Spirit, we invite you.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   We welcome you.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:11.100]   We open our hearts to you today, Lord.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.220]   Whether we're like Mary,
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.860]   perhaps there are things in our lives
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.380]   that you wanna come and bless us,
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.420]   you wanna come and speak to us,
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.260]   you wanna come and release a word of life over us.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:29.020]   Perhaps today here, some of us will be like
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.260]   Elizabeth, you are going to fill us with your spirit
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.140]   and you're going to speak through us.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.140]   We're going to be your mouthpiece today.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:40.340]   Holy Spirit, I just welcome you.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.540]   I just pray that you will come and fill us right now.
