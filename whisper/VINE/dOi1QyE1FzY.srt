1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
 and welcome them to The Vine.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,840
 It's great to have you with us.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,720
 Love it.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,680
 Well, welcome to The Vine.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,480
 If you're joining us online for the first time,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,120
 it's so great that you guys are with us

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,600
 and we've got people joining in from all over the world

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,520
 every single week and even here in Hong Kong as well.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,440
 So we just bless you.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,920
 Thank you for joining us as part of our kind of diaspora

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,040
 community all over the world.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,640
 We're so grateful that you're with us.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,720
 And everybody in this room, welcome here.

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,760
 And you might be new to The Vine,

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,280
 and we recognize that some of you have joined us

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,480
 since we started the service,

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,760
 and we always welcome people

18
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,720
 right at the start of the service.

19
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,800
 So I wanna re-welcome you if you're new

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,760
 and never been to The Vine before.

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,800
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here,

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
 and it's great to have you with us.

23
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,960
 I'm so excited about baptisms.

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,040
 Amazing 15 candidates where you are.

25
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,960
 You're all scattered around the room here.

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,320
 So excited about that.

27
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,360
 If you've got nothing to do for your lunch,

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,800
 I can't recommend more highly than Repulse Bay

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,400
 at two o'clock to witness 15 people

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,840
 going down into the waters of baptism.

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,320
 We always joke here at The Vine,

32
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,520
 we do our baptisms in Repulse Bay Beach, it's public.

33
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,360
 And we always joke, it's the only baptism in the world

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,400
 where you go down clean and come up dirty.

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
 (audience laughing)

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,760
 It's true, I've done many baptisms in Repulse Bay.

37
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,560
 I remember this one time, can I tell you a quick story?

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,080
 It's got nothing to do with what I wanna preach about,

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
 but I'll tell you a quick story.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,400
 This one time, I'm there with our group, right?

41
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,760
 And we have like four groups, and I turned to the left,

42
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,200
 and I kid you not, there's a poo floating.

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,720
 Like, I kid you not, like literally

44
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,520
 like five meters away from us.

45
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,680
 And so I'm like, we're doing like the intro

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,040
 for this person in front of everybody,

47
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,960
 and I'm like backwashing the...

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,560
 (audience laughing)

49
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,000
 And we like dunk them, and I'm like keeping an eye,

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,160
 bring them back up.

51
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,040
 Anyway, so we get through all the candidates

52
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,880
 whilst the poo's floating like five minutes away.

53
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,000
 And afterwards, I like sort of just gently

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,600
 kind of go out to like, and it was classic, it wasn't poo.

55
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,040
 It was like a bunch of like chocolate,

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,720
 like all gathered together like that.

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,760
 I know, okay, anyway.

58
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,560
 So look forward to your baptisms, by the way,

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
 if you're getting baptized today.

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
 Keep your eyes peeled for the mercies of God.

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
 Hey, I'm excited.

62
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,880
 I wanna do a one-off message today

63
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,360
 on the topic of giving your finances to the church.

64
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,320
 Yeah, I know.

65
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,920
 For some of you are like,

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,800
 really, I showed up for this Sunday?

67
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,480
 (laughing)

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
 You know, in eight years of being your senior pastor,

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,760
 in 12 years of being a full-time pastor here at the Vine,

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,560
 in 25 years of preaching,

71
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,880
 I have never preached a message

72
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,440
 specifically on this topic of giving financially

73
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
 to your local church.

74
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,560
 And I almost feel a bit derelict

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
 in my pastoral duties to you of never teaching on this topic.

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,080
 We've talked about generosity here.

77
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,600
 We've talked about finances here at the Vine,

78
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,080
 but the specific idea of giving your money to church

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,880
 is not something we've taught on.

80
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,880
 And I wanna be honest with you right up front

81
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,280
 and just confess the reality

82
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,360
 that I think I've stayed away from the topic out of fear.

83
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,960
 You know, out of the fear

84
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,160
 that the topic would come out in such a way

85
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,080
 or could get twisted in such a way

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,480
 that you would feel manipulated

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,200
 or coerced into giving to the church.

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
 And, you know, I think the global church

89
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,380
 has done a relatively poor job

90
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,920
 over the years of teaching on this topic.

91
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,240
 And therefore, so often people kind of feel a sense of guilt

92
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,440
 or a sense of shame when this topic comes up.

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,520
 And I just wanted to kind of confess to you

94
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,520
 that there's a certain amount of fear in me.

95
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,560
 And I think that's why I've kind of stayed away

96
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,980
 from the topic.

97
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,120
 There's also something else.

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,880
 There's a sense of biasness in me, if you will,

99
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,440
 a sense of conflict of interest bringing this topic to you,

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,120
 because the reality is myself and my wife,

101
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,680
 we make our full-time income, our full-time livelihood

102
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,100
 off of your generosity, off of your giving to the Vine.

103
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,720
 So you literally, your giving here

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,280
 literally puts clothes on my back.

105
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,360
 It puts food on my table.

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,400
 It educates my daughter.

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,400
 My whole life is driven by your generous giving to the Vine.

108
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,240
 And so if there was ever a topic

109
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,540
 where I'm tempted to preach really well

110
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,400
 to get a good result out of, it's this topic, right?

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
 So I just realized that there's this bias

112
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,180
 and conflict of interest.

113
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,000
 And I just wanna be really honest with you

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
 right up front about that.

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,500
 And I wanna commit to you right at the start of this message

116
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,200
 that I'm gonna preach this based on scripture

117
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,160
 without fear or favor, okay?

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
 Without fear or favor.

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
 The other thing I wanna be just really conscious of

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,140
 is that the timing of this message is a little bit suspect.

121
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,440
 If you've been coming to the Vine

122
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,280
 for the last four or five months,

123
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,120
 you'll realize that we have been

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
 struggling somewhat financially.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,600
 In fact, since June of this year,

126
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,000
 we've been in a deficit every single month.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,020
 That deficit has either been anywhere

128
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,060
 from between about 500,000 Hong Kong dollars

129
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,040
 to about 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars each month.

130
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,720
 And we obviously can only sustain our life

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,640
 and our ministry in the church

132
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,400
 for a certain period of time

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,760
 when we're in a deficit like that every month.

134
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,280
 And that concerns me.

135
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,740
 And I think it should concern all of us.

136
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,080
 If this is your home church and if this is where you come,

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,440
 I think that's a shared responsibility for us

138
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,620
 and a shared thing that should concern us.

139
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,200
 But I wanna just recognize that the timing of this

140
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
 is also a little bit suspect.

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,040
 Does that make sense?

142
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,820
 And I'm not gonna, again, make an excuse for that.

143
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,880
 I'm gonna teach into this

144
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,120
 because I think we need to teach into it here at the Vine.

145
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,560
 We did a survey with you guys a few months ago

146
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,520
 and we asked you a whole bunch of different questions

147
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
 in that survey.

148
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,880
 But one of the questions we asked you was,

149
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,880
 if you consider the Vine your home church,

150
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,820
 do you regularly give money to the Vine?

151
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,960
 And 70% of you, 70% of you said you did,

152
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,240
 which means 30% of you said you did not.

153
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,880
 And I wanna just honor and just kind of speak

154
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,440
 to the 70% in this room

155
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,880
 and those that are online right now as well.

156
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,520
 We wanna thank you for your generosity,

157
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,100
 for the way in which you stand behind this church.

158
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,720
 This church is a very generous church

159
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 over all the 25 plus years of our existence here in Hong Kong

160
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,000
 and I know I can look around this room

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,520
 and I can see faces in this room

162
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,160
 of people that have been in the Vine

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
 for a long period of time

164
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,120
 and people that have generously and faithfully stood with us.

165
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,280
 So I just wanna honor that 70%.

166
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,080
 I wanna also honor and recognize that 30%.

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
 And I wanna say this right up front,

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,000
 no judgment at all on that 30%.

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
 We recognize that there are many reasons

170
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,740
 why people are not in a position

171
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,120
 or people do not bring their tithes into the church.

172
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,840
 And so we recognize that things have been challenging

173
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,280
 in this season of life and here in Hong Kong.

174
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,000
 And so we also honor, we recognize,

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,520
 we see also the 30% of you in this room.

176
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,760
 Now, I wanna be clear about this.

177
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,460
 My message today is not to get the 30% to give

178
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,880
 and it's not to make the 70% feel good about yourselves.

179
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,300
 Are you with me?

180
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,280
 My message is not designed at all to do that.

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,280
 I wanna actually speak a message that's to all of us.

182
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,120
 I wanna speak about the importance

183
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,200
 of what we do with our finances to all of us

184
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,600
 'cause I believe it's important for all of us.

185
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,760
 And I believe also that I think we can very easily

186
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,360
 get trapped under faulty thinking

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,100
 and I would argue faulty guilt and faulty shame

188
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,400
 when it comes to this reality of our finances

189
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,920
 and particularly in giving to the local church.

190
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,360
 And so I want to bring this message to you today,

191
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,480
 to all of us 'cause I think it's relevant

192
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,840
 that we all wrestle with this topic more and more

193
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,440
 and ask ourselves personally some pretty important

194
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,280
 and I think some pretty exciting and liberating questions.

195
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,080
 That's what I wanna do, is that okay?

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,440
 So if we're gonna talk a little bit

197
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,680
 about giving money to a church,

198
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,320
 we have to talk about this concept of tithing.

199
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,880
 And so I wanna spend a little bit of time up front

200
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,320
 just kind of addressing the reality of tithing

201
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,960
 and helping you to understand it

202
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,000
 because I think there are a lot of misunderstandings

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,080
 around it, a lot of things that I think

204
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,560
 can distract us on this topic.

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,240
 So the concept of tithing is first introduced in scripture

206
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,600
 in the third book of the Bible, the book of Leviticus.

207
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,180
 And it's important that you understand this

208
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,640
 because it's an important time of when God

209
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,440
 is actually shaping and building his people

210
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,680
 to be a people that can represent his heart to the world.

211
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,680
 And so Leviticus comes obviously right there

212
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,120
 at the beginning of scripture in the Pentateuch,

213
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,760
 but it comes right at the time that God's people

214
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,440
 have received their liberation from the Exodus.

215
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
 Now this is important because in the time before the Exodus

216
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
 God's people are in slavery.

217
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,980
 Slaves do not earn money.

218
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,920
 The literal definition of a slave

219
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,360
 is that there is absolutely no income.

220
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,000
 You're a slave to something

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
 and you have to serve something else.

222
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,680
 And God has now liberated his people

223
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,200
 from a place of slavery, brought them into a place

224
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,280
 of freedom and that freedom would mean

225
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,320
 that they have now the ability to earn

226
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,120
 and to receive income and to receive material goods.

227
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,100
 And that's a good thing in God's eyes.

228
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,440
 But with that comes a shaping of the community

229
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,320
 so they would have the right heart and the right attitude

230
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
 to the new things that they were to receive

231
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
 in their liberation.

232
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
 Is that making sense?

233
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,120
 So one of those things, there was a bunch of different laws

234
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,140
 that God brought at that time,

235
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,320
 but one of those was the idea of tithing.

236
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
 And tithing was the concept.

237
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,600
 The word is an English, an old English word.

238
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,680
 It literally means 10th.

239
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,280
 But the idea was that you set aside a portion of your income

240
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,240
 as a first fruits faith offering to God.

241
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,760
 So whenever it is that you were to receive your income,

242
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,180
 whether that was on a weekly basis

243
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,400
 or in the biblical times in the Old Testament,

244
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,080
 it might be at the harvest time or something like that,

245
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,360
 you would set aside a specific amount

246
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,080
 and it was contractually, legally obligated

247
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,880
 for you to do this, to set aside a 10th

248
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,240
 of that everything that comes in as a tithe

249
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,040
 that was to be given as a faith offering to God.

250
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
 Now, it's really important that you understand

251
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,000
 that this was a legal, contractual obligation

252
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
 of God's people.

253
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,780
 And because of that, there were blessings and curses

254
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,960
 that came alongside of it.

255
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,380
 Now, the whole point of a tithe was

256
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,160
 there were practical reasons for it

257
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,580
 and spiritual reasons for it.

258
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,920
 Let me break these down real quick.

259
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,080
 On the practical side in the Old Testament,

260
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,420
 the tithe was this idea that these 10th

261
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,000
 of everything that we have comes into the storehouse

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,080
 in the temple to be used for two practical purposes.

263
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,040
 First of all, to provide for the Levite tribe in Israel

264
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,640
 to be able to be fully 100% committed

265
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,840
 to serving the spiritual and religious life

266
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,920
 of all of the other tribes in Israel.

267
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,580
 When Israel came into the promised land

268
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,600
 in the Old Testament, the 12 tribes,

269
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,560
 11 of them received a portion of the land

270
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
 as their inheritance and their income

271
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,280
 and their wealth generating perspective.

272
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,220
 But one tribe, the Levites did not.

273
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,640
 The Levites were set aside to serve in the temple

274
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
 as the tribe that would serve the rest

275
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,400
 of the religious life of Israel.

276
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,720
 And so this tithing that came in,

277
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
 part of that went practically to keep the Levites alive,

278
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,680
 literally, so that they could serve the rest of Israel.

279
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,580
 That makes sense?

280
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,200
 The second practical reason was out of the overflow,

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
 the abundance of what was given,

282
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,660
 'cause once the Levites were provided for,

283
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,280
 there was a lot of other goods and finances left over.

284
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,480
 And that was to be used and distributed into the community

285
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,660
 to help the poor, to help the vulnerable,

286
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,680
 to help the broken, the marginalized,

287
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,200
 those that were desperate in community.

288
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,520
 The excess finances were to be used practically

289
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,400
 to serve the poor in Israel's community.

290
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
 So the Levites on the one side

291
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
 and then the overflow to serve the poor.

292
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,920
 Making sense so far?

293
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,240
 Now, there was a spiritual side to this as well.

294
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,220
 It wasn't just about what was practically

295
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,140
 the right thing to do.

296
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,500
 There was a spiritual side,

297
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,920
 and the spiritual side was the idea

298
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,340
 of worship and submission.

299
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,300
 God understood that when his people came out of slavery

300
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,780
 into a place of newfound freedom

301
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,680
 and where they were receiving material goods,

302
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,980
 there was a danger that they would shift their trust of God

303
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,260
 away from him and towards the material things

304
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,980
 that they earned and created for themselves.

305
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,000
 And so tithing was a way for God to build a spirit

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,680
 amongst his people where they would continue to say,

307
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,280
 literally, that God is the place that I trust

308
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,040
 for all of my needs.

309
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,240
 So my setting aside of a portion of my income

310
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,080
 right at the start of every month

311
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,720
 and giving that to God was a way of saying,

312
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,520
 "God, you are ultimately the one that I trust

313
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,720
 "to provide my needs."

314
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,500
 And when Israel failed to give their tithe,

315
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,860
 what it communicated to God was this,

316
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,940
 "I don't ultimately trust you,"

317
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,100
 which is why God has a lot of strong things to say

318
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,920
 in the Old Testament when Israel held back

319
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,320
 their tithe from him.

320
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,780
 God was like, "I wanna prove my faithfulness to you.

321
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,340
 "I wanna prove that I am trustworthy to you.

322
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,920
 "So when you give to me your tithe as your first fruit,

323
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,760
 "as a symbolic act of submission to me,

324
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
 "I will prove to you my trustworthiness to you.

325
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,720
 "I will give and replenish and help you and walk with you.

326
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,840
 "I won't give up on you.

327
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,220
 "I won't turn my back on you.

328
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,000
 "I will open up my generosity to you

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,080
 "and you will know that I am faithful."

330
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,240
 This is why in Malachi, God says it specifically like this.

331
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,040
 He says, "Test me in this."

332
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,160
 It's the only thing in the Old Testament scripture

333
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,900
 that God says, "Test me on it.

334
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,800
 "Test me that if you give me your tithe,

335
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,220
 "will I not open up the storehouses of heaven

336
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,680
 "and pour out my abundant blessings upon you?"

337
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,960
 So there was this idea that there was a spiritual idea

338
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,740
 that if I was to give to God,

339
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,240
 it was an act of prophetic trust,

340
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,480
 that I trust him more than I trust my resources.

341
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,440
 God would be tested in that

342
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,440
 and pour out his blessing on his people,

343
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,160
 which in turn would cause them

344
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,380
 to want to be more faithful to God in their giving.

345
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,340
 And so there was this cycle that took place

346
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,300
 between God and his people

347
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,540
 that had blessings and curses attached to it

348
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,460
 as they showed their faithfulness

349
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,340
 and God responded in his faithfulness to them.

350
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,100
 All that making sense?

351
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,620
 Now we get to the New Testament and things change

352
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,980
 'cause in the New Testament,

353
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,500
 you see what happens is that everything gets reinterpreted

354
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,260
 through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.

355
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,500
 And Jesus himself said,

356
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,900
 "I haven't come to abolish the law,

357
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,040
 "but I have come to fulfill it."

358
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,980
 And so there are some things in the Old Testament law

359
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,700
 that didn't carry forward

360
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,660
 into the New Testament world of grace,

361
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,840
 but there were other things that carried forward,

362
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,540
 not in the kind of letter of the law,

363
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,820
 but in the spirit of that law.

364
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,060
 And tithing is one of the interesting things.

365
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,140
 Tithing is only mentioned twice

366
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,320
 in the whole of the New Testament.

367
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,580
 The legal contractual element of tithing

368
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,940
 that was linked to the Old Testament in Jesus Christ

369
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,620
 is gotten away with in the New Testament.

370
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,700
 The whole sense that I have this legal obligation,

371
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,360
 a contractual responsibility,

372
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,700
 you don't see that at all in the New Testament.

373
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,020
 The only two times when tithing is mentioned,

374
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,940
 it's specifically talking about an Old Testament story

375
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,420
 or an Old Testament moment.

376
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,860
 No, you don't get that in the New Testament,

377
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,800
 but here's the really important thing.

378
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,660
 Where you see in the New Testament

379
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,540
 a cessation on the contractual legal obligation reality

380
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,380
 of the tithe,

381
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,380
 what you see is an enhancement on the spirit of the tithe.

382
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,740
 Are you with me?

383
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,220
 So while the contract is gone

384
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,180
 and the legal obligation and slavery to that is gone,

385
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,760
 there is actually enhancement on the joy

386
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,380
 of partaking in the giving

387
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,060
 that happens in relationship to God.

388
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,100
 This is why in Acts chapter two,

389
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,660
 you see the church pouring out an abundant amount

390
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,140
 of their resources,

391
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,620
 bringing those resources,

392
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,180
 placing them at the feet of the apostle

393
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,420
 so the apostles could then distribute those resources

394
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,580
 to those in need in the community.

395
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,660
 The same spirit of the Old Testament tithe,

396
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,020
 but now not done under a contractual 10th,

397
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,180
 but a way greater amount of that

398
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,260
 done in freedom, life, and joy.

399
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,740
 And here's the interesting thing.

400
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,640
 That practical part of the Old Testament

401
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,220
 continues in the New Testament.

402
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,120
 When that money was brought to the apostles' feet,

403
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,500
 that money would have gone to help the apostles

404
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,340
 to continue to live full-time in serving Israel

405
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,460
 in the spread of the reality that Jesus is the Messiah

406
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,660
 and the birthing of the new church.

407
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,100
 And the overflow of what was given

408
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,060
 was used by the apostles to help those in need.

409
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,820
 So the same thing that was taking place

410
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,660
 in the Old Testament

411
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,980
 continues to take place in the New Testament

412
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,420
 as the apostles received what was given

413
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,140
 and enabled themselves to continue to minister and teach

414
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,320
 and spread the gospel,

415
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,020
 as well as taking care of the needs

416
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,340
 of the people around them.

417
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,740
 They learned this from Jesus himself.

418
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,220
 I mean, Jesus had given up his profession as a carpenter

419
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,420
 and had gone into a full-time teaching ministry

420
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,380
 for about three years.

421
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,100
 And Luke tells us that wealthy women supported Jesus

422
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,020
 to be able to do that.

423
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,180
 Wealthy women would gather around him and support.

424
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,620
 Paul himself, we often admire Paul and celebrate Paul

425
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,780
 because he's the one who was a tent maker.

426
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,540
 Well, absolutely, in Corinth, Paul made tents

427
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,980
 and that was one of the ways

428
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,740
 that he was able to finance himself.

429
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,980
 But outside of Corinth,

430
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,540
 for the rest of the majority of Paul's ministry,

431
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,980
 he was supported by the churches, giving him income

432
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,660
 so that he could continue to flourish in what he was doing.

433
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,900
 Is this making sense?

434
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,460
 So the practical side of that element of the tithe,

435
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,060
 although the contractual obligation is gone,

436
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,540
 the practise and the practicalness of it

437
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,500
 continues in the New Testament.

438
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,740
 But it's this spirit of it,

439
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,140
 the spiritual importance of the giving,

440
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,340
 that is the thing that is truly enhanced.

441
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,460
 In fact, I would argue this,

442
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,220
 not just enhanced, but completely revolutionised.

443
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,460
 And that's actually what I wanna talk about most today,

444
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,220
 how the New Testament changes the spirit

445
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,860
 of the heart of our giving.

446
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,500
 And to do that, I wanna jump back to the book of Philippians

447
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,260
 because we're in Philippians as a church

448
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,580
 over the last seven weeks.

449
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,980
 We've been embedded into it.

450
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,860
 It's been healthy for us.

451
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,780
 We know the context.

452
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,780
 And Philippians has a lot to say about our giving.

453
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,300
 And in fact, in Philippians, what Paul essentially does,

454
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,740
 and we've been talking in this series

455
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,420
 about a new way to pray or a new way to lead

456
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,260
 or a new way to have holiness.

457
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,060
 Well, what you also see in the book of Philippians

458
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,300
 is a new way to give.

459
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,420
 And this is what I want us to focus on a little bit

460
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,580
 with each other this morning, this new way to give.

461
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,100
 Now, we know from the context of Philippians,

462
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,540
 as we've been talking about the last seven weeks,

463
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,980
 that Paul's in prison.

464
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,980
 We know that in prison with Paul, he's awaiting trial.

465
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,620
 And whilst in prison, there's no social welfare system

466
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,580
 to give him funds whilst he's there.

467
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,260
 He's relying on the support of the community

468
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,980
 to keep him alive whilst he's waiting for trial.

469
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,500
 And Philippians, the church in Philippi,

470
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,180
 was one of the churches that was giving money

471
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,020
 so that Paul would be alive and would flourish

472
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,860
 whilst he was in prison.

473
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,620
 And actually, what Philippi did

474
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,060
 is they raised up one of their members,

475
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,580
 a guy called Epaphroditus,

476
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,500
 and they gave Epaphroditus all the money

477
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,780
 that they had saved up.

478
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,540
 And Epaphroditus goes to Paul in prison,

479
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,300
 which was in a completely different city.

480
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,620
 So he travels there and he brings Paul this gift

481
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,260
 from Philippi, this welcomed gift of finances

482
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,780
 so Paul would be able to survive in prison.

483
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,020
 And right at the end of the letter,

484
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,240
 he thanks them for this gift.

485
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,100
 But the way he thanks them is completely mind-blowing.

486
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,940
 And I wanna open that up for you today

487
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,620
 as a way of hopefully encouraging us

488
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,980
 as we think about giving.

489
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,420
 Is everybody okay still?

490
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,820
 You alive?

491
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,340
 All right, here we go.

492
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,140
 Philippians chapter four, verse 10 onwards.

493
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,660
 Paul writes, "I rejoice greatly in the Lord

494
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,340
 that at last you have renewed your concern for me.

495
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,780
 Indeed, you have been concerned,

496
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,860
 but you've not had the opportunity to show it.

497
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,180
 Now, I'm not saying this because I am in need,

498
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,620
 for I've learned to be content whatever the circumstances.

499
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,180
 For I know what it is to be need,

500
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,500
 but I also know what it is to have plenty.

501
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,340
 I have learned the secret of being content

502
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,300
 in any and every situation,

503
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,580
 whether well fed or hungry,

504
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,620
 whether living in plenty or in want.

505
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,300
 I can do all things, everything,

506
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,620
 through Him who gives me strength.

507
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,860
 Yet it was good of you," notice this,

508
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,700
 "to share, to partake together in my troubles.

509
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,500
 Moreover, as you Philippians know,

510
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,940
 in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel,

511
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,020
 when I set out from Macedonia,

512
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,300
 not one church shared with me

513
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,820
 in the matter of giving and receiving."

514
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,020
 In other words, no other church was giving to me

515
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,300
 at that time, except you only.

516
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,340
 "For even when I was in Thessalonica,

517
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,660
 you sent me aid again and again when I was in need.

518
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,500
 Not that I'm actually looking for a gift,

519
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,300
 but I'm looking for what might be accredited

520
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,780
 to your account.

521
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
 I have received full payment and even more.

522
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,100
 I'm amply supplied now that I have received

523
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,580
 from Epaphroditus the gift that you've sent.

524
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,540
 These are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice,

525
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,540
 pleasing to God, and my God will meet all your needs

526
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:35,220
 according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus."

527
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,220
 This is an absolutely stunning part of Paul's letter

528
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,180
 because he's actually completely reinventing the concept

529
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,860
 and the idea of giving.

530
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,020
 He honours Philippi for the fact that they were faithful

531
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,220
 in their giving to him.

532
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,220
 In fact, he kind of throws Thessalonica under the bus,

533
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,660
 the church there under the bus,

534
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,860
 'cause he's like, "Even when I was living in that church,

535
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,140
 they weren't supporting me, you guys were supporting me.

536
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,940
 You were the one who was sending me aid, right?"

537
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,460
 So he's pretty full on with them about it,

538
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,300
 but he wants to thank them, he wants to thank Epaphroditus

539
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,100
 and the reality that they have all this money

540
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,220
 that's been coming into him.

541
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,380
 But very importantly, he says something,

542
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,260
 he teaches something here designed to help to disrupt

543
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,740
 the way they were currently thinking about their giving.

544
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,160
 Let me show you the argument he makes.

545
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,980
 He says this, "You guys have met my needs

546
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,140
 time and time again.

547
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,420
 This is pleasing to God.

548
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,020
 My God will meet all of your needs."

549
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,260
 Now, when we read that with our modern thinking

550
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,200
 and the New Testament church that we're a part of,

551
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,040
 we look at that and we think,

552
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,900
 "Well, that's not such a big deal."

553
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,780
 But actually, if you were to read this

554
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,140
 from that first century Greco-Roman context

555
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,460
 that the church was embedded in,

556
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,380
 this was completely radical.

557
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,040
 He's saying to them, "You gave money to me

558
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,760
 to help me to live.

559
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,900
 That was pleasing to God."

560
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,740
 So guess what?

561
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,740
 My God is going to respond in faithfulness now to you.

562
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,320
 Now, what is he actually saying?

563
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,780
 Well, I want you to see some words he uses here

564
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,300
 in verse 17 onwards.

565
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,660
 He says, he uses this word,

566
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,920
 "Credited to your account,

567
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,020
 received for payment and amply supplied."

568
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,500
 Now, these three phrases

569
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,460
 are specifically Greco-Roman business words.

570
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,780
 Paul is using these words on purpose

571
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,320
 'cause he's trying to stir up some baggage

572
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,420
 that these words were associated with.

573
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,500
 Accredited to your account, full payment, amply supplied,

574
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,520
 words that were used within the business

575
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,740
 and social context of first century Greco-Roman life.

576
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,380
 And they always were creating a certain idea.

577
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,740
 And the idea was this,

578
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,560
 the concept of gift and reciprocity.

579
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,980
 This was something that was central

580
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,680
 to the Greco-Roman way of life.

581
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,940
 Let me explain it to you.

582
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,220
 Let's say, so Nate's sitting right here.

583
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,060
 Hi, Nate, how you doing?

584
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,880
 Good to see you.

585
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,940
 So let's say Nate invites me over to dinner at his house.

586
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,860
 And my wife and I, we go over to Nate's place,

587
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,760
 Nate's and Christina,

588
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,620
 and we sit down and we have a wonderful meal with them.

589
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,500
 That's great.

590
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,620
 And we leave that time.

591
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,060
 Immediately, Chris and I,

592
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,840
 with the gift and reciprocity idea,

593
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,500
 would be thinking, okay, now we owe them a dinner.

594
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,340
 Right?

595
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,580
 Now we need to actually invite them over

596
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,440
 to our place for dinner.

597
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,580
 And so we arranged for them to come over the next week

598
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,520
 to our place for dinner,

599
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,060
 because we're feeling like we're a little bit in debt

600
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,520
 to them and we invite them over.

601
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,560
 Now here's the kicker thing

602
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,580
 with the Greco-Roman concept of gift and reciprocity.

603
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,220
 It's not just good enough for us now

604
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,220
 to invite them over for dinner.

605
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,340
 Because if we did that, our gift is equal.

606
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,660
 We have to top their gift.

607
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,380
 So we're gonna invite them over for dinner.

608
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,500
 And when they sit down,

609
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,580
 we're gonna give them the best bottle of wine

610
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,460
 that we can afford.

611
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,300
 Right?

612
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,500
 We're gonna add that little cherry on the top

613
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,660
 that's gonna sweeten the deal.

614
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,500
 Why?

615
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,140
 'Cause that means they're then in debt now again to us.

616
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,760
 And we know what's gonna happen in the future.

617
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,180
 They're gonna then invite us back to their place

618
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,140
 and they're gonna give us not one bottle,

619
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,380
 but two bottles of wine.

620
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,460
 And it's gonna be great.

621
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,300
 Right?

622
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,180
 Now we laugh,

623
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,080
 but this was the Greco-Roman context

624
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,740
 of social relationships.

625
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,460
 It was an incredibly difficult and complex relationship

626
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,340
 of one-upsmanship with each other all the time.

627
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,500
 Isn't it great that we don't act like this anymore

628
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,140
 in the modern culture?

629
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,020
 Come on, guys.

630
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,780
 Come on, let's be honest.

631
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,600
 Right?

632
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,660
 We know what it's like within both,

633
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,020
 not just Chinese culture,

634
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,600
 but Western culture as well.

635
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,460
 We still play the game of reciprocity with us.

636
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,180
 And it creates in us this sense of debt and obligation.

637
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,500
 Paul, in writing to the church, wants to subvert this.

638
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,300
 This is why he doesn't say,

639
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,140
 "You gave a gift to me to help me with my needs.

640
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,940
 I therefore am very grateful.

641
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,920
 Therefore, I owe you back."

642
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,760
 All right?

643
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,580
 Do you follow that?

644
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,980
 That's what Paul would have said

645
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,340
 if he was wanting to keep up

646
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,460
 with the Greco-Roman context.

647
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,300
 Instead he says,

648
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,900
 "You gave a great gift to me for my needs.

649
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,940
 God was pleased with that gift.

650
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,820
 My God will now supply all your needs."

651
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,740
 He's subverting it all.

652
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,700
 Look at the words.

653
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,740
 He uses these words.

654
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,580
 He says,

655
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,700
 "These gifts that you've given are a fragrant offering,

656
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,780
 an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God."

657
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,060
 He actually, interestingly,

658
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,260
 brings up the Old Testament concept of sacrifice

659
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,800
 and fragrant offerings,

660
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,100
 the tithing concept from the Old Testament.

661
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,220
 He brings that in because he's trying to say,

662
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,100
 "We don't live by these Greco-Roman concepts

663
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,020
 together anymore.

664
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,660
 We instead live under a different idea."

665
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,000
 And he's even willing to bring up the Old Testament tithe,

666
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,320
 but he's about to completely subvert that as well

667
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,000
 'cause it's no longer about obligation.

668
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,880
 It's about something new.

669
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,680
 You see, for Paul, there was a new divine economy.

670
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,520
 And this divine economy was different

671
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,600
 from everything we see in the world.

672
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,800
 And Paul's passion was that the church

673
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,300
 would not get sucked in to an economy

674
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,040
 based on the world's thinking,

675
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,320
 but would have a divine economy

676
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,720
 based on what God sees in this world.

677
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,200
 Let me teach on this real quick

678
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,940
 by telling you a little bit

679
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,600
 about transactional relationships in relation to giving

680
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,120
 and a Trinitarian relationship in relation to giving.

681
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,440
 Is everybody still okay?

682
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,080
 You're tracking with this?

683
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,000
 Is this helpful for you?

684
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,480
 You have to say yes to these questions.

685
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,320
 I know, it's weird.

686
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,880
 I say it every week, but it's the reality.

687
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,080
 Now, the transactional relationship to giving

688
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,520
 was the Greco-Roman concept.

689
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,000
 It was transactional debt and obligation,

690
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,140
 one-upsmanship, you give to me,

691
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,800
 I'm in debt to you, I better give to you,

692
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,780
 so you're in debt to me.

693
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,080
 And then we can just play this little

694
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,520
 hierarchical relationship in our social relationship.

695
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,440
 That was the transactional relationship.

696
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,680
 And here's what Paul's thinking.

697
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,880
 He's like, we cannot be like that in the church.

698
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,360
 'Cause if we're like that in the church,

699
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,420
 we're not showing the world what God is truly like.

700
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,240
 You see, Paul understood

701
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,640
 that if we had a transactional relationship

702
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,400
 amongst ourselves in the church,

703
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,820
 ultimately what that says

704
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
 is that we have a transactional relationship

705
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,480
 with God as well.

706
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,040
 And the picture of God

707
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,240
 that that places at the center of the universe

708
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,700
 is basically the idea of a divine accountant.

709
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,520
 Think about this for a second.

710
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,560
 If you're an accountant in here,

711
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
 please apologize for the next five minutes

712
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,040
 that I'm about to say.

713
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,300
 A divine accountant, a slightly grumpy God

714
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,520
 that sits up there in the sky somewhere,

715
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,120
 who has a scorecard for every single person in this room.

716
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,240
 And you're trying to,

717
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,680
 there's a left-hand column and a right-hand column.

718
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,260
 In the left-hand column is all the bad stuff that you do.

719
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,180
 In the right-hand column,

720
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,780
 there's all the good stuff that you do.

721
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,080
 And because God is this grumpy divine accountant,

722
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,400
 you're living your faith,

723
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
 you're living your life

724
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,300
 to try to get more on the good column

725
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,980
 than on the bad column.

726
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,500
 And if you've got more on the good column

727
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
 than on the bad column,

728
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,200
 you can expect the blessings of God.

729
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,340
 Are you with me?

730
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,300
 But every time we act and every time we do something,

731
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
 whether it's coming to church,

732
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,660
 whether it's giving money to the church,

733
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,900
 whether it's whatever we do,

734
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,260
 giving our time and energy,

735
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,080
 if we have a transactional relationship with God,

736
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
 if we see him like this divine accountant,

737
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
 we're trying to store up the goodie bank

738
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,560
 on the good side of the column

739
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,680
 so that it outweighs the bad side of the column

740
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,280
 so that we can feel good about ourselves

741
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,240
 and think that God feels good about us.

742
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,380
 When you give with that mindset,

743
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,920
 I'm gonna say it this strongly,

744
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,820
 we dishonor the character of God amongst us.

745
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,340
 And Paul wants to flip that on its head

746
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,500
 and say there is another way

747
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,800
 because the reality is if our relationship is transactional,

748
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,880
 the result of that is always going to be

749
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,400
 feelings of guilt, shame, and obligation.

750
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,840
 And I want, if you hear nothing else

751
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,900
 in what I've been preaching,

752
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,820
 I want you to hear this.

753
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,640
 I wanna free you today from guilt, shame, and obligation

754
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,500
 when it comes to your giving here at the Vine.

755
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,460
 Because if that's our precept,

756
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,300
 if that's our concept,

757
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,460
 then we're in a transactional relationship

758
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,180
 with one another and with God.

759
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,920
 And I don't think that's what God wants.

760
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,620
 Instead, it's this Trinitarian idea.

761
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,220
 Paul always brings things back to the idea

762
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,260
 that the God is made up of the Father,

763
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,900
 the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

764
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,380
 that there is this in God himself, the one God.

765
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,460
 There are three persons,

766
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,980
 and the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit,

767
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,180
 three distinct persons,

768
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,220
 but constantly one community together.

769
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,680
 And in that community, it's a community of endless,

770
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,980
 self-giving, self-sacrificial,

771
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,740
 other-sensed giving and love

772
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,780
 towards the other within the community.

773
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,620
 And Paul realizes that what sits

774
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,340
 at the centre of the universe

775
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,260
 is not the grumpy accountant with a scorecard,

776
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,580
 but this endless cycle of self-living,

777
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,700
 self-giving, self-loving unity

778
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,140
 seen in the beautiful thing of the Trinity.

779
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,460
 And Paul takes that rather distant theological concept

780
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,620
 and says the church should look like this.

781
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,960
 Like if we're gonna be a community

782
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,780
 that represents the heart of God,

783
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,460
 then it has to be in this idea of a endless cycle

784
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,020
 of giving and other-centred self-love,

785
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,980
 loving the other around us.

786
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,620
 And Paul says that's the way it should be.

787
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,460
 So when you read in Acts chapter two

788
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,660
 that the church was selling their fields

789
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,820
 and bringing the money in

790
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,620
 and laying it at the apostles' feet,

791
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,660
 it wasn't because they were contractually,

792
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,420
 legally obligated to do it.

793
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,340
 It wasn't because their pastor was standing up

794
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,340
 making them feel guilty about it.

795
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,300
 It was because they realized that there was another way

796
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,820
 to live, that God has created a new world

797
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,120
 where there's a Trinity that sits at the heart of it,

798
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,460
 this endless cycle of self-giving love.

799
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,260
 And who wouldn't wanna be a part of that?

800
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,960
 And so they bring their resources to the apostles' feet

801
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,340
 because their hearts are pumping.

802
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,220
 And they're saying, "There is great joy

803
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,380
 "that I get to be a part of a new economy,

804
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,660
 "a new way of understanding

805
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,300
 "that it's not about debt and obligation

806
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,700
 "and who's got the better hand.

807
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,100
 "It's about the giving of all of myself,

808
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,100
 "knowing that God is able to give and supply all my needs."

809
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,960
 This is why Paul says here that Christ responds.

810
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,820
 He says, "And my God will meet all your needs

811
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,260
 "according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus."

812
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,780
 In other words, you cannot out-give God.

813
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,980
 Now this is not prosperity gospel.

814
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,460
 This is not if you give $10,

815
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,480
 God's gonna multiply and give you 30 back, right?

816
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,420
 This is the idea though, that there is a new economy

817
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,220
 where God has these riches and abundance

818
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,740
 and he wants to pour it out on his faithful people.

819
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,820
 And in the reciprocity relationship,

820
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,140
 the transactional relationship,

821
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,940
 you're always trying to remember who's the one

822
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,900
 who's got the power in this relationship at this point.

823
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,420
 In the Trinitarian relationship,

824
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,340
 you're no longer trying to work out the power.

825
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,600
 You lose track of who owes who.

826
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,680
 You're just happy that you're a part of it,

827
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,120
 that you get to give.

828
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,880
 This idea of the Trinitarian way of giving in the church

829
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,320
 is throughout all of Paul's writings.

830
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,960
 Let me give you a couple of quick verses as I close.

831
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,280
 2 Corinthians 9, starting in verse seven.

832
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,000
 "Each person should give

833
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,440
 "whatever they have decided in their heart to give."

834
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,320
 It starts in the heart, not reluctantly.

835
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,480
 In other words, you should feel joy

836
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,420
 in being a part of this new economy, a new way of life.

837
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,440
 But also not under compulsion.

838
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,400
 You should be freed from obligation and debt and guilt

839
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,320
 because we're no longer operating with a divine accountant

840
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,640
 in the transactional way.

841
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,740
 "For God loves a cheerful giver."

842
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,280
 And God, notice the cycle here.

843
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,700
 "And God is able to make all the grace abound to you

844
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,280
 "so that in all things at all times,

845
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,860
 "having all that you need, you are abounding in good work."

846
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,800
 Look at the cycle.

847
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,200
 You bring your tithe and your offering

848
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,120
 and your love to God in this community called the church.

849
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,680
 And God makes all grace abound to you,

850
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,080
 which overflows in you to more grace abounding to Him.

851
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,320
 And you get lost in this cycle of endless self-giving.

852
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,120
 And it is a wonderful picture of grace.

853
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,600
 Notice what he says in 1 Corinthians 16, verse two.

854
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,940
 Paul gets practical with his church here.

855
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,080
 He says, "On the first day of every week,

856
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,480
 "each one of you should set aside a sum of money

857
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,760
 "in keeping with your income, saving it up

858
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,220
 "so that when I come to you,

859
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,440
 "no collections in addition to that will need to be made."

860
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,760
 Paul's trying to liberate his church from a formula,

861
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,840
 but he's not averse to giving some practical advice.

862
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,960
 And so I wanna finish this with some practical advice,

863
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,120
 but don't think that I'm now teaching you a formula.

864
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,760
 Are you with me?

865
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,600
 Are you with me?

866
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,240
 He says this.

867
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,680
 First of all, he says, "Your giving needs to be periodic."

868
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,280
 "On the first day of every week."

869
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,480
 Well, that was what was right for them

870
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
 in the way that they were paid,

871
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,920
 maybe for us it might be the first of the month,

872
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,280
 it might be the first quarter when we get our dividends in

873
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,960
 or get a bonus or whatever it might be.

874
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
 But whenever we are regularly paid,

875
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,080
 there is a regular response.

876
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,560
 It's periodic.

877
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,040
 We make that a regular commitment of our hearts.

878
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,460
 It's also personal.

879
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,300
 Notice what he says.

880
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,520
 "Each one of you," I love this,

881
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,600
 "nobody else can be generous for you."

882
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
 No one else can give for you.

883
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,120
 You, each one of you are being called

884
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,120
 to partake in this beautiful new economy

885
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,560
 of grace and love and joy

886
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,920
 and sacrifice towards one another.

887
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,480
 So each one of you,

888
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,040
 I think sometimes the temptation in a church

889
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,200
 the size of the vine

890
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,920
 is to think that others will carry the heavy weights.

891
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,960
 Each one of you, it's a personal thing.

892
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,180
 He then says, "It is a planned thing."

893
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,500
 "Should set aside a sum of money."

894
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,480
 "There should be intention in our giving."

895
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,520
 It's not, "Oh yeah, shoot, it's offering today."

896
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,440
 "What do I have in my wallet?"

897
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,400
 "Here's a hundred bucks."

898
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,960
 There's an intention to it, a planned perspective in it.

899
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,400
 I wanna turn my heart towards God in this new economy,

900
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,160
 this new way to give, not under compulsion,

901
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,760
 not under legalism, not under some guilt,

902
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,120
 but under this beautiful idea

903
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,680
 that if I'm intentional with the first fruits of what I have,

904
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,720
 that's the best way that I can honor God.

905
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,000
 And then finally, it's proportionate

906
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,320
 in keeping with their income.

907
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,200
 There's a proportionate amount of giving.

908
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,520
 The reality is those that earn more

909
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,880
 have the ability to give more.

910
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,200
 So this is a challenge to those who are wealthier

911
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,240
 within a church community to say that your giving

912
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,200
 should be in proportionate to your income.

913
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,520
 But it's also a challenge

914
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,800
 to the lower income earners of a community

915
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,400
 'cause it doesn't let them off.

916
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,240
 In whatever income that you are receiving,

917
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,560
 whether a lot or a little,

918
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,920
 you give generously without compulsion and guilt

919
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,640
 'cause you want to be a part of this great new economy

920
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,960
 that God has created.

921
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,320
 You wanna see the church alive and flourishing,

922
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,080
 and you do it in proportion to what God has done to you.

923
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,000
 And here's the crazy thing.

924
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,760
 As you sow, as Paul says,

925
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,120
 those that sow generously reap generously.

926
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,240
 There's this idea of the cyclical nature of how God moves

927
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,760
 and has his way amongst us.

928
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,640
 So I hope you see that the question I often get asked

929
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,200
 is this, the question is this.

930
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,800
 Under New Testament grace,

931
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,360
 should I still give 10% of my income to the church?

932
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,480
 I hear that question all the time.

933
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,040
 And I hope now at the end of this message,

934
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,340
 you realize that that's a painfully flawed question.

935
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,600
 Because if we're asking that question,

936
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,120
 we're still caught up in the divine accountant

937
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,640
 and transactional nature.

938
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,400
 'Cause that question essentially is,

939
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,440
 what's the minimum amount of money that I can give

940
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,140
 to appease God and Andrew?

941
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,820
 (congregation laughing)

942
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,340
 When instead, perhaps our question should be,

943
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,180
 do I really get to be a part of this?

944
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,180
 Like who wouldn't wanna be a part of this?

945
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,260
 And so I give.

946
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,020
 Can we pray?

947
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
 Let's pray together.

948
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,580
 Father, we are really grateful.

949
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,080
 Grateful that you have taken us from slavery to freedom.

950
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,080
 And in our freedom, we have grace.

951
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,320
 This joy of recognizing that everything we have

952
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,160
 comes from you.

953
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,820
 And that you call us to be stewards of what we have received.

954
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:28,000
 But Lord, we don't want to very quickly fall into the trap

955
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,520
 that the church in Philippi could fall into.

956
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,000
 A sense of reciprocity in our relationship with you.

957
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,640
 A sense of our giving being tied to that Old Testament

958
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,960
 contractual legal obligation.

959
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,040
 Lord, I'm so grateful that we are freed from the contract,

960
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,080
 but are enhanced in the spirit.

961
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,300
 And Lord, that is our challenge.

962
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,120
 To think whether our giving practices,

963
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,720
 whether to the church or elsewhere,

964
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,520
 our spending habits,

965
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,720
 whether what it is that we do with our finances

966
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,400
 is driven more by the divine accountant,

967
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,300
 contractual, transactional relationship.

968
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,960
 Or whether we are really truly operating in the freedom

969
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,640
 that comes from the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

970
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,840
 A Trinitarian picture of the world,

971
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,160
 where in the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit,

972
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,240
 we have the perfect model of what community looks like.

973
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,440
 And that in this community at the Vine Church,

974
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,960
 we would wanna stand with one another,

975
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,100
 freely giving and freely receiving.

976
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:43,260
 Not playing one-upmanship with you, God,

977
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,120
 but celebrating the joy that comes

978
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,580
 in a God who is able to supply every need.

979
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:56,480
 Father, I pray that you would shake up our culture,

980
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,280
 that you would challenge us deeply,

981
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,660
 and you would release us into this grace

982
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,320
 with joy in our hearts.

983
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,940
 That we would literally find ourselves saying,

984
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,440
 "Wow, I get to be a part of this."

985
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,300
 Whether it's our time, our talents, our gifts, resources,

986
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,860
 yes, our finances.

987
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,460
 We would bring it to you, not counting beans,

988
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:26,360
 but bring it to you, overflowing with joy.

989
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,420
 Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
