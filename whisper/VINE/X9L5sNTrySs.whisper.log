[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   Amen.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.680]   Amen.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.240]   Let's look at this first picture.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.580]   This is Immaculee Ilebagiza.
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.540]   In 1994, she was a university student in Rwanda.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.540]   During the Rwanda genocide,
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.960]   the genocide found its way to her village.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.620]   During this time, a pastor grabbed Immaculee
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.920]   and seven other women and hid them in his en suite bathroom.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.760]   It was a small room, four foot by three foot.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.540]   He moved his dresser to hide the door,
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.680]   and it was there they stayed for 91 days
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.440]   in order to survive the genocide.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.300]   After the genocide was over,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.660]   Immaculee found herself standing in front of the very person
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.900]   who killed her own mother and her brothers,
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.240]   and she said the words, "I forgive you."
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.580]   She later went on to be an advocate for reconciliation,
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.280]   going on to speak all over the world,
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.380]   and when asked about this encounter
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.620]   with this man who murdered her family, she said this,
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.360]   "I believe that we can heal Rwanda and our world
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.120]   "by healing one heart at a time."
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.260]   This next photo was taken in 1983.
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.420]   This is Pope John Paul II
[00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.560]   visiting Mehmet Ali Aksa in his jail cell.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.860]   Two years before this, Mehmet attempted
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.660]   to assassinate the pope,
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.900]   shooting at him multiple rounds in St. Peter's Square.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.420]   Two of those bullets hit the pope.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.140]   While suffering severe blood loss,
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.640]   the pope was able to survive.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.200]   He made a full recovery, and when he was able to,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.800]   about a year and a half later,
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.860]   he decided to go visit Mehmet in his jail cell
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.080]   to offer him forgiveness face to face.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.580]   This was the picture of that conversation.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.920]   27 years after this conversation,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.220]   it was the pope himself who advocated for Mehmet
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.880]   to be pardoned and released from jail.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.620]   In fact, at the end of his life, near the end of his life,
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.780]   Mehmet was quoted as saying, "The pope is my friend.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.420]   "The very man he tried to kill."
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.040]   This next photo is a picture of me with my own son.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.080]   I had the rare opportunity to spend a full day with him
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.520]   as my eldest son was going on a school trip,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.280]   so we were planning what to do,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.640]   and he only asked for one thing,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.000]   "Take me to Universal Studios."
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.460]   And I was like, at this point,
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.820]   we were in Singapore for about three years now,
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.880]   so we've been many times, okay?
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.600]   Universal Studios in Singapore is not even that big,
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.680]   especially one of the major areas being renovated,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.120]   so I was like, "Buddy, we've gone a lot,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.660]   "it's very expensive, let's do something else."
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.920]   I see some people, "Pfft."
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.580]   Visibly sad, my son gives me a hug,
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.800]   and he says, "It's okay, Dad."
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.680]   Now, my son's 10, okay?
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.720]   I didn't know he knew verse psychology.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.320]   I didn't know that he accessed Jedi mind trick powers,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.280]   but where was that picture taken?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.520]   Universal Studios.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.380]   On the Transformers ride.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.920]   Forgiveness has the power to change a country.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.520]   Forgiveness has the power to change a man.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.920]   Forgiveness has the power to change people's decisions,
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.160]   and in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.400]   forgiveness has the power to change history.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.680]   Today, I'll be continuing our forgiveness sermon series,
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.240]   and I'll be looking at the more practical side
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.440]   of what forgiveness is.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.040]   Why don't you join me as I pray before we really start?
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.080]   Jesus, let the words of my mouth
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.560]   and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight,
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.020]   O Lord, my rock and redeemer.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.640]   Amen, amen.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.040]   Right, as introduced, I am super excited
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.800]   to be back here at the Vine.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.840]   So yes, I know some of you, but I don't know a lot of you,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.680]   so I do wanna introduce myself again.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.840]   Yes, my name is Derek, I'm based in Singapore.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.560]   I work for a company called Momenta Group,
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.920]   and I primarily function as an executive coach
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.960]   and a corporate trainer, and more recently,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.900]   I'm in charge of our sales team in Singapore.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.340]   I had a lot more to say about this,
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.680]   but Ellison told me, "Stop talking
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.000]   "about all this stuff that you do."
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.540]   Sorry that I have a job after pastoring.
[00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.880]   Jeez.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.240]   He's praying for me to not be successful
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.840]   so I can come back to the Vine.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   Anyway, so yes, I was a pastor, though,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.720]   and that's more relevant to everyone here today.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.260]   From 2003 to 2010, I had the honor of pastoring
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.520]   our young adults at 180, and a lot of the people
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.560]   that I pastored then are currently in leadership
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.020]   here at this church, and it's an honor
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.200]   to see a lot of you here still now.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.420]   2010, 2014, I went to seminary.
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.460]   Yes, I served as a pastor, and then I went to seminary.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.320]   That's kinda how we rolled back then at the Vine.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.680]   Not anymore, not anymore.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.120]   I guarantee you we're different now.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.560]   2014, I returned to serve under a young man
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.760]   named Andrew Gardner and help pastor this church,
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.380]   and I joined with Pastor Carla
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.920]   to form the pastoral leadership team.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.720]   In 2019, I felt the Lord called me
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   to focus primarily on executive coaching
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.400]   and corporate training, so that's when I was last
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.360]   here to speak here.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.760]   So I have a deep, deep history with this church.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.040]   This is my home church.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.560]   In fact, in February 2001, I became a Christian
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.240]   at my very first Vine service, so this is home to me.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.120]   You all are home to me, and I celebrate you all
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.840]   from Singapore, and it is an honor to be back.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.640]   So pastoral team, oh, not pastoral, all right,
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.600]   Carla and Allison, thank you for having me back.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.880]   And of course, Andrew, I just wanna say
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.640]   I love you and I miss you.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.520]   We're doing fine.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.440]   Don't worry about us.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.640]   I know he's gonna watch to make sure I'm
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.960]   preaching from the Bible and all that stuff.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.000]   So, hi, Andrew.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.640]   Okay, so let's get going.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.320]   So for those of you that need it,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   I'm gonna just share a roadmap for what I'm gonna do,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.000]   'cause some people really, ah, what are we talking about?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.840]   Where are we?
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.960]   So I'm gonna look at what is forgiveness.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.060]   I'm gonna look at what is not forgiveness.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.360]   I'm gonna talk about why we should forgive,
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.440]   how do we forgive, and then I'm gonna do
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.520]   a kind of a now what at the end, okay?
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.440]   So this is our roadmap.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.280]   This is where we're gonna go.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.600]   So firstly, what is forgiveness?
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.300]   And before I start this in earnest,
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.440]   my mandate was to not give the kind of
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.560]   biblical foundation of forgiveness.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.080]   Pastor Promise did that last week,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.400]   and if you haven't done that,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.480]   please go listen to it if you haven't done so.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.000]   And if you are wondering, Promise,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   when I was, Promise came to us as an intern.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.360]   He came onto my team.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.760]   He's not here, so I can talk about him.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   So he now has taken my role, my title, and my haircut.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.960]   So, you know, just give him some love.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.160]   He's wondering if it's a midlife crisis.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160]   It absolutely is.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.820]   So just help pray for your pastors.
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.400]   They need it.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.840]   So please listen to that sermon if you haven't done so.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.760]   That's the biblical understanding.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.000]   So I'm going to give more of a practical one.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.560]   So, and apart from scripture and our shared experience
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.740]   as believers, there's actually been a lot
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.480]   of academic research on forgiveness.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.480]   And really, it's incredible what the transformative power
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.580]   of forgiveness is.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.540]   And before we get into that part,
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.880]   I must say that I am not a therapist, okay?
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.800]   I'm not actually a certified therapist.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.400]   But what I am is I have over 13 years
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.600]   of pastoral experience and in counseling.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.480]   I also am a certified executive coach since 2011.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.640]   And I myself have been through years of counseling.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.000]   So I come at it from a type of practitioner,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.140]   and I'm also a client, you know?
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.620]   So I have a lot of experience in this.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.420]   So let's look at what forgiveness is.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.500]   The American Psychological Association,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.060]   the APA, puts it like this.
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.120]   And I really want you to open your mind
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.400]   to what the secular clinical description is.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.240]   It's fascinating.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.600]   Let's look at what forgiveness is.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.680]   Forgiveness involves willfully putting aside feelings
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.920]   of resentment towards someone who has committed a wrong,
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   been unfair, or hurtful, or otherwise harmed you in some way.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.320]   Forgiveness is not merely accepting what happened
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.920]   or ceasing to be angry.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.740]   Rather, it involves a voluntary transformation
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.760]   of your feelings, attitude, and behavior
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.600]   so that you are no longer dominated by resentment
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.940]   and can express compassion, generosity, or the like
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:51.640]   toward the person who wronged you.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:57.200]   This is the clinical description of what forgiveness is.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.840]   So if you break this down, there is a lot happening, right?
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.720]   Here, you have to willingfully decide,
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.680]   I am going to put aside resentment, right?
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.760]   I am going to decide to willfully put that aside.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.560]   It's not just stopping to be angry.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.240]   There is a decision that I was being full of resentment
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.960]   and anger, but now I'm not going to access that anymore.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.120]   But then there's a second part of transforming
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.400]   those feelings, and attitudes, and behaviors
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   into something else, compassion, generosity, and the like.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.880]   So forgiveness, there's this both internal transformation,
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.200]   but there's also an external one as well.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.560]   There's a lot happening in this phrase
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.440]   that we say to forgive someone.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.200]   And actually, in my preparation, I came across a number
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.240]   of different adaptations of this,
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.000]   and for today's purposes, I came across another one
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.480]   which I think you'll find very interesting.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.720]   There are two therapists, Enright and Fitzgibbons,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.000]   and they wrote a book, "Forgiveness Therapy,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.720]   "An Empirical Guide for Resolving Anger and Restoring Hope."
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.280]   Fascinating title, and I'm working my way through this book.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.040]   But I want you to hear their definition of forgiveness.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   A willingness to abandon one's right to resentment,
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.160]   negative judgment, and indifferent behavior
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.020]   towards the one who unjustly injured us,
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:35.020]   while fostering the undeserved qualities
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.480]   of compassion, generosity, and even love.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:48.240]   A willingness to abandon resentment,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.440]   negative judgment, and indifference.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.420]   That phrase is powerful, because if you've ever been hurt,
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.320]   if you've been abused, if evil has been done to you,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.080]   you have an internal right to access things like anger,
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.480]   frustration, right?
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.520]   If that has been done to me, especially if it was unjust,
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.840]   then surely, internally, I can be angry,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.440]   I could even want justice, maybe even revenge.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.560]   That's my right, 'cause it was done to me.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.280]   But in therapy, I love this definition,
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.080]   'cause it's saying, yes, you have that right,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.800]   but you are willing to abandon that right.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.820]   That you are saying, I am no longer going to access
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.320]   this frustration, this anger, this pain, this revenge.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.460]   And then, not just not access this,
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.080]   but then I'm going to now transform.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.000]   And I love this phrase, I'm gonna foster this thing,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.720]   and it says this, the undeserved qualities.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.980]   It's not deserved.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.720]   But I choose to offer it anyway.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.880]   You know what this is?
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.320]   I don't know if Enright and Fitzgibbons are Christian,
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.200]   but I think they stumbled on a beautiful,
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.120]   secular description of what grace is.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.800]   This is a beautiful description.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.880]   I am no longer gonna access that resentment,
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.000]   and I'm gonna transform and foster
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.200]   something completely undeserved.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.980]   Compassion, generosity.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.560]   I love that, I love seeing this.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.800]   I was so struck,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.000]   because I felt that this was the gospel
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.100]   being explained to me.
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:33.400]   True forgiveness, then, is both an internal transformation
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.040]   and an outward change of feelings,
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.360]   attitudes, words, and behaviors.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.720]   It is a both/and.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.880]   There are two things happening, my internal world
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.240]   and what's happening in my external world, too.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.960]   Not my words, this is the clinical definition.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.080]   So if that's the case, then,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.400]   if this is what forgiveness is,
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.860]   well, then we can talk about what forgiveness isn't.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.720]   And I'll say this, forgiveness is not just saying the words,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.560]   I forgive you, right?
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.480]   It's not just saying, nah, I forgive you,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.280]   or in today's world, just send the text, I forgive you.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.320]   Right?
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.520]   And that's not it, because what we read there
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.120]   is that there is an internal transformation
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.840]   and an external change, as well.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.120]   So it cannot just be words.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   And if any of you work with teenagers,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.480]   you can see how someone could say something
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.660]   like, I forgive you, or I'm sorry, and not mean it.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.160]   I have a teenage boy, when I catch them
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.360]   fighting with my other son, and I make him apologize,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.800]   I can tell, he doesn't mean it.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.920]   That's not what true forgiveness is, right?
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.240]   There has to be both an internal and external change.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.600]   There's another phrase that you hear a lot,
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.660]   oh, just to forgive and forget.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.560]   Let's just forgive and move on.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.180]   And you know, I fundamentally disagree with that.
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.480]   Because you know what, even Jesus, in his resurrected body,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.000]   he did not cleanse his body of the scars, right?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.960]   You ever think about that?
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.360]   He went to Thomas, put your hand on my scar, feel it,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.460]   because that proves I have overcome death.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.500]   See, if Jesus didn't remove his scars,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.320]   I know why I still have mine.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.080]   'Cause I can say, look at the power of Jesus
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.100]   through my scars.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.920]   So it's not about just removing these thoughts,
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.020]   it's about addressing them, and saying,
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.120]   because of the love and power of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.540]   I stand healed.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.960]   So no, it's not about forgetting.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.120]   And this last one really triggers me.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.560]   'Cause people, I've actually been in a coaching situation
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.660]   where someone said, I'm not gonna forgive,
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.200]   because I don't wanna be seen to be taken advantage of.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.320]   I don't wanna be weak.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.480]   And when I hear that, there's something inside me
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.180]   that breaks, because of the situations
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.720]   I've been a part of in my life.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.600]   Now before I move on, this is a trigger warning.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.800]   I'm about to talk about death by drunk driving
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.440]   and sexual abuse.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.200]   If you feel that you cannot be here for this conversation,
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.440]   or that you need to take an exit,
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.700]   please go ahead, take a bathroom break, take a walk,
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.060]   come back in a few minutes.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.900]   Thank you.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:30.700]   When I hear this phrase, to forgive is to be weak,
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.920]   I think about when I was in university.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.520]   I was a first year in University of Michigan,
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.880]   which is in 1997, for those of you
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.280]   who wanna know how old I am.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.960]   (audience laughs)
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.720]   And it was the middle of winter,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.240]   so it was snowy on the ground, and my friend is a Korean.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.600]   And in Korean American culture especially,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.960]   as soon as Koreans hang out,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.600]   they understand immediately who's older, right?
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.960]   And they have this concept of hyun,
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.400]   which is the older brother, older student,
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.760]   and there's a respect factor.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.960]   And the older sibling, the older person
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.320]   is supposed to kind of protect the younger person.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.880]   So this is hyun, you're my elder, take care of me.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.020]   So these guys, I wasn't with them,
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.080]   but these guys were drinking,
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.480]   and they were having a great time.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.920]   And the hyun, the older student, says to my friend,
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.560]   hey, we need to get some cigarettes, we're out of cigarettes.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.680]   So he's like, okay.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.960]   Jumped in the car, drove off.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.600]   Middle of the night, they were drinking,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.780]   snow on the ground.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.640]   Sure enough, that elder student skid off the road,
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.740]   smashed into a tree.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.700]   It was later reported because of the seatbelt,
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.480]   the driver sustained minor issues,
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.520]   but my friend was not wearing a seatbelt.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.120]   Flew right through their windshield.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.060]   I'll spare you the details,
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.260]   but he was later declared dead at the scene.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.040]   Two days later was the funeral.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:02.000]   And when my friend's mom came face to face
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.260]   with the driver of that car,
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.860]   she just broke and sobbed.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.120]   And she went to this young man,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   and she just kept hitting him like this,
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.400]   thumping on his chest.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.120]   And she was yelling something in Korean,
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.760]   and I turned to my Korean friends, what is she saying?
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.960]   And she was saying, you were supposed to protect him.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.920]   You were supposed to protect him.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.280]   Because he's hyun, he's the oldest.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.360]   And she just kept hitting him,
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.960]   and it was just this gut-wrenching moment
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.800]   where we were all just watching.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.060]   And eventually she ran out of energy,
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.780]   and then she just hugged this man,
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:42.820]   and just continued to sob into his chest.
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:49.540]   You're gonna tell me that this woman was weak
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.520]   to extend just that little bit of forgiveness
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.120]   to this person who just accidentally killed her son?
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.460]   No, no way.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.620]   That was the most incredible example of strength
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.720]   I could ever think of.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.320]   As a pastor, I've literally stood with a person
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.780]   who has experienced sexual abuse in their life,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.100]   and they decide to, in prayer,
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.020]   forgive the person who abused them.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.620]   And then this person was gripping their fists so tight,
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.740]   tears streaming, and their whole body was tense,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.820]   and they uttered the word, "I forgive them."
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.340]   Is that weakness?
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.780]   It is the most powerful, strongest thing
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.180]   you could possibly do.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.860]   To forgive is no weakness.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.400]   It is powerful.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.400]   So what's actually happening when you forgive?
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.100]   What's going on, both internally, what's happening?
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.940]   What is the process?
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.180]   Why should we even do this?
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.300]   Let me give you the academic research, okay?
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.700]   Look, I'm not a therapist,
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.140]   but I want you to see all of the research
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.100]   that I brought here, and when I say research,
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.740]   I do mean Chat GPT, in case you're wondering.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.300]   I told you that I'm not a therapist.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.340]   You're all wondering, as soon as I put this up,
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.020]   yes, it is Chat GPT, but I did at least check
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.580]   these resources, come on now.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.560]   But look at this list.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.100]   Reduced blood pressure, lower stress levels,
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.580]   improved heart health, reduced chronic pain,
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.580]   better sleep quality, improved immune function,
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.940]   lower risk of heart attack.
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.420]   These are all proven by academic research.
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.880]   This is what happens when we forgive.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   So this list alone should be great reasons
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.420]   why we forgive, right?
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:54.420]   There's so many amazing benefits, yet we don't, right?
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.600]   Okay, maybe you're not a therapist,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.740]   maybe you don't do research,
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.380]   but maybe you can anecdotally also prove this.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.900]   Think about it like this, think about the opposite.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.780]   Let's say you've been abused,
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.140]   let's say you've experienced some evil,
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.260]   something has happened where you hold this resentment,
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.860]   this anger, this bitterness,
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.500]   and instead of releasing it in forgiveness,
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.700]   you put it inside you, and you carry it.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.700]   What is that gonna do to you over time?
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.220]   Think about the stress that you're gonna live with.
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.160]   Think about how your quality of sleep
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.860]   is gonna be impacted, right?
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.820]   All of these things we know,
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.820]   because probably many of us experience this.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:38.580]   So you can appreciate this research
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.320]   because we know the opposite,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.120]   and maybe you're experiencing exactly that right now.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.940]   If you live a life of forgiveness,
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.500]   we know from the research it increases your health
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.120]   and your quality of life.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.360]   That's not me, that's the research.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.160]   But why don't we do this?
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.760]   Because it's so difficult, right?
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.640]   I mean, I'll say, so Dr. Aaron T. Beck,
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.000]   who is another clinical psychologist,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.960]   and he was considered to be the father
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.400]   of our modern day style of therapy,
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.440]   which is cognitive behavior therapy, so CBT.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.080]   He was known to say virtually all of human disturbance
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   is the result of blaming others,
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.420]   blaming society or blaming self
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.820]   for things that have happened.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.820]   And for such blaming, the need for forgiveness arises.
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.700]   So what he's saying is virtually all of the things
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.940]   that we struggle with in therapy
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.780]   is that we need to forgive someone
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.740]   and we can't do it on our own.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.860]   That's why there's so many therapists.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.460]   That's why there's so many counselors in this world.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.180]   And what the predominant thing that people need to do
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.080]   when they see a counselor is to forgive.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.980]   And you know, honestly, I am really amazed and impressed
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.180]   and hopeful for the younger generations,
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.060]   for the Gen Zs and the Gen Alphas,
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.460]   because they're trailblazing to normalize therapy.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.940]   Right, do you know how hard it is to get a boomer
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.100]   or my Gen Zs, Gen Xs,
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.300]   do you know how hard it is to get us to therapy?
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.080]   We need to be falling apart before we're gonna admit
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.640]   that I need help and I'm gonna talk to someone about it.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.340]   But the younger people,
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.660]   some of the younger people that I lead,
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.420]   no, I'm going to therapy, it's Friday.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.460]   I'm like, okay.
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.100]   You know, I'm like, great.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.060]   You know, not only are you doing it,
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.780]   but let's just talk about it.
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.540]   Like, the older generations, you'll never know.
[00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.860]   And that's why I think there's hope.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.020]   Things are gonna change.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:47.000]   But if this is a kind of physical, academic reason,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.420]   what about a spiritual, scriptural reason?
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.980]   Now, I know my mandate isn't to do a biblical thing,
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.540]   but I'm gonna do it anyway 'cause I am.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.980]   So number one, right?
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.180]   This is a biblical, scriptural, theological construct
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.060]   for why we should forgive.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.060]   One, 1 John 4, 7-8, we were dead in our transgressions.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.420]   Right, we are separate from God.
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.980]   Our destiny was determined to be separate from God
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.460]   because of the sin in our life.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.100]   That is truth as we understand it as believers, right?
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.540]   So our destiny is broken,
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.900]   and we're gonna be separate from God.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:31.540]   However, we know that Jesus has come.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.060]   In Romans 3-23, it says that all have fallen short,
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:41.020]   but Jesus redeems us through the cross, right?
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.540]   So our eternity now has changed.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.660]   We have been justified to be
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.520]   in eternal relationship with Jesus,
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.100]   but that's in eternity.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.180]   What about today?
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.420]   Well, right now, you and I have the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.660]   We are currently and consistently
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.840]   in every single moment sanctified
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.500]   by the presence of the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.780]   according to 1 John 1-9.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.740]   So not only is our eternity set,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:06.180]   but our current presence now is sanctified
[00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.780]   and cleansed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.900]   But not only that, our status has changed
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.580]   because now, Romans 8-17, we are co-heirs with Christ.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.000]   What an amazing thing that our eternity is now changed
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.920]   and our presence is now forgiven,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.400]   and we are now status changed
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.880]   between co-heirs with Christ.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.560]   Now, what do we do with this new life and new status?
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.980]   Ephesians 4-32 says love.
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.040]   Love one another
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.720]   because love, 'cause you have been loved.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.340]   And the exclamation point is in Colossians 3-13,
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.780]   forgive because you have been forgiven.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.700]   So not only do we forgive as believers
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.380]   because we have been forgiven,
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.740]   because Jesus, our Lord and Savior,
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.020]   has exemplified a life of forgiveness,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.660]   and we have been commanded to do so.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.500]   So if you want a scriptural foundation for this,
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.240]   this is it.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.160]   We have been redeemed.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.740]   What do we do with that redemption?
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:24.220]   This is a theological construct for forgiveness
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.720]   based on the life and work of Jesus,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.200]   but what about outside of Jesus?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.340]   What about the whole Bible?
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.400]   Well, the Old Testament is full of examples
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.480]   of God forgiving his people.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.700]   They constantly turn their backs on them.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.980]   The Israelites say, "We don't even remember who you are,"
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.840]   and God delivers them and forgives them repeatedly.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.540]   The New Testament, after Jesus was resurrected
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.220]   and he ascended to heaven,
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.520]   the early church is full of stories of forgiveness.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.960]   But I'm gonna bring out one, and that's Stephen.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.360]   After Jesus ascended to heaven,
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.060]   the early church started to erupt.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.900]   And people were saying, "Jesus is the Messiah."
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.980]   And Stephen was calling out the Pharisees,
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.020]   the religious order saying,
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.020]   "And you were the ones that killed him."
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.380]   Now to say that someone was Messiah in those days,
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.540]   it is punishable by death because it is blasphemy.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.960]   So the religious leaders had every right
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.460]   to take Stephen out and to stone him to death,
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.560]   and that is exactly what they did.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.380]   Acts 7, 59.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.240]   As they started to stone Stephen, Stephen says,
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.220]   "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.440]   He falls to his knees, and as he was being stoned,
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:50.100]   he said, "Jesus, do not hold their sin against them."
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:56.800]   You want examples of forgiveness?
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.060]   This man was being stoned to death,
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.580]   and his last words were, "Forgive them."
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.900]   This is the rich history we have as believers.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.380]   We forgive because there are physical and mental benefits.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:18.580]   We forgive because we have the example of Jesus,
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.420]   our Lord and Savior.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.080]   We forgive because we've commanded to,
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.700]   but we also forgive because we have this amazing history
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.020]   from creation all the way till today,
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.500]   and it will continue forevermore until Jesus comes back.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.360]   Forgiveness earmarks us as believers.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   And you know, honestly, I forget
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.220]   that this is our foundation sometimes.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.000]   Now, since I've been coaching since 2011,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.680]   and since 2019, I've been coaching primarily
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.120]   in a non-Christian space,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.480]   and honestly, it's just been amazing sometimes.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.640]   There was a situation where I was coaching
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.600]   the number three person in an organization,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.240]   and it just so happened this person
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.000]   had developed a very negative relationship with their CEO.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.920]   It was so bad that this person would just be triggered
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.760]   seeing that person, and they couldn't communicate,
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.400]   and she was losing sleep, and she was just having anxiety,
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.680]   and so it ended up she decided,
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:23.200]   "I'm gonna resign from this position," which is fair,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.000]   but her contract stipulated that she had many months left
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   to serve out, so as I coached her, I was saying,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.800]   "You know, how do you want these last few months to go?"
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.400]   "I don't know, maybe I'll just avoid him."
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.680]   And I said, "Well, I don't know if that's really possible.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.080]   "Four months is a long time, and you gotta hand over."
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.200]   And I just explored.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.080]   I said, "Is it okay if I have a suggestion?"
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.340]   I said, "Would you like to kind of take a look
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.060]   "at this relationship?
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.720]   "There's a lot of time for us to just address it."
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.200]   I used that phrase, "Let's just address it."
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.400]   I didn't use, I didn't say, "Why don't you forgive him?"
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.560]   I didn't say, "Hey, let's, forgiveness,
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.040]   "let's reconcile," right?
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.760]   I didn't say any of that, and I'll never forget this,
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.280]   and forgive my language.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.640]   She looked at me and she said, "What?
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.000]   "No, I'm gonna make his life a living hell."
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.200]   And I was like, "What?"
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.760]   I didn't say that, 'cause if I'm doing that
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.800]   in a professional context, that would not be appropriate
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.520]   for me to say, "What, what's wrong with you?"
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.800]   But I realized this is a clash of values,
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.280]   because for me, when I heard that this person
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.480]   was experiencing anxiety, that there was a breakdown
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.720]   in the relationship, that she just struggled
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.200]   to even see that person, I'm like, "Why don't you forgive?"
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.040]   And I say that because I've been forgiven by Jesus.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.040]   Why not?
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.560]   This is on the tip of my tongue.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.960]   It's right there because I'm a believer.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.080]   She does not have that context.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.080]   So for her, it was extremely natural
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.520]   for her to access revenge, right?
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.760]   This person hurt me, wronged me,
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.400]   therefore, I'm gonna, I have, remember the definition?
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.840]   I have the right to access resentment.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.680]   And I was like, "Wow, we have completely
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.040]   "different foundations."
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.480]   If you call yourself, if you identify as a believer
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.480]   in Christ, we have this foundation of forgiveness
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   that should always be somewhere in our consciousness.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.760]   And experiencing the life of people who don't know Jesus,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.160]   I realized, "Wow, sometimes they do not."
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:50.360]   Now, if this is why we should forgive and why we should
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.520]   forgive and what happens when we forgive,
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.400]   how do we actually do this?
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.840]   What does it even look like?
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.200]   Now, remember the definition is that there's both
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.440]   an internal addressing of the situation,
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.620]   but there's also an external change as well.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.720]   So taking the definitions that I shared earlier,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.520]   here are some steps for forgiveness.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.160]   And if any of you are therapists or have been to therapy,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.280]   you'll recognize these steps.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.320]   First is you need to choose to act.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.360]   Going to therapy and dealing with forgiveness,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.840]   you need to do something.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   I cannot reach into your heart and make you forgive someone.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.040]   You have to do that, right?
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.440]   You cannot sit there and say, "Well, make me."
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.320]   It doesn't work like that, right?
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.120]   So forgiveness needs to first and foremost
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.260]   be a decision that you make.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:48.480]   Then, whatever it looks like, whether you're talking
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.400]   to someone or you're actually going to therapy itself,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.280]   be willing to abandon your rights to that as resentment.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.840]   What that means is you have to choose to address the issues.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.520]   I have literally been in coaching and in pastoral
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.240]   counseling situations where the person in front of me
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.800]   was forced to be there.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.700]   Either it was a child, like their parents made them,
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.680]   or their spouse or significant other made them.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.040]   And they're sitting there and they refuse to talk about
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.520]   what they really need to talk about.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.400]   It is the most frustrating thing I'm doing
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.000]   when somebody is forced and they don't talk
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   and I'm like, "Buddy, it's been 50 minutes.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.280]   "What are we talking about?"
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.040]   That is not how I coach, by the way.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.520]   That's just my internal mind.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.500]   I feel like I'm confessing a lot here.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.320]   But if you're going to act on forgiveness,
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   you need to be willing to go there.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.160]   And that's hard, I understand that.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.320]   But you need to be willing to address that resentment
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.120]   and start that process of abandoning your rights
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:53.000]   to that resentment.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:53.840]   And you know what?
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.280]   If you've ever been to therapy,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.600]   you know it is not a one-time thing.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.480]   It is a constant, repeated thing.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.320]   Why?
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.280]   Because you go one week, you peel back a layer,
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.720]   oh, there's another one, oh, there's two more.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.360]   And you just keep going and then you're like,
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.120]   "What are we talking about?"
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.160]   Jeepers, we're covering everything because it goes deep.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.060]   So it's a repeated process.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.880]   But it isn't just not feeling anger or resentment.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.360]   Remember, it's fostering something else.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.400]   It's transforming into something else.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.240]   And I love this phrase by Enright and Fitzgibbons
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   that it is fostering the undeserved qualities of compassion.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.180]   People who have hurt you,
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:42.520]   they may never deserve your grace and forgiveness.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.360]   Full stop.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.240]   But forgiveness is a choice that you make
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.620]   in light of that situation.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:56.680]   So you foster the undeserved qualities of compassion,
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.440]   generosity, and according to Enright and Fitzgibbon,
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.920]   maybe even love.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   And again, it's not a one-time thing.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.880]   It's rinse and repeat.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.480]   Keep doing it.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.240]   Until, remember, this is the outcome,
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.140]   that you are no longer dominated by resentment.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:16.920]   Now, as I say this repeatedly,
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.080]   I know some of you right now are looking at me,
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.580]   and you are honestly dominated by resentment.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.840]   And as I am speaking, I am inviting the Holy Spirit
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.920]   to just knock on your heart.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:33.300]   And the question is, maybe it's time.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:38.500]   So this is the clinical process of forgiveness.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.840]   This is what happens when you go see a therapist.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.000]   Of course, it's different ways,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.180]   but this is how I was brought through forgiveness.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.980]   But let me give you a scriptural one.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.280]   Let me give you a scriptural how to forgive.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.440]   And I was introduced to this translation.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.120]   It's called the Passion Translation.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.360]   It's a paraphrase, kind of like how the message was.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.120]   So it's called the TPT.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.540]   So in the TPT, let me read you Proverbs 20, verse 22.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.960]   "Don't ever say, 'I'm going to get even with them
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.600]   "if it's the last thing I do.'"
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.720]   That's revenge.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.560]   Don't do that.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.060]   "Wrap God's grace around your heart,
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.180]   "and He will be the one to vindicate you."
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:22.260]   Wrap God's grace around your heart.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:27.140]   Your heart may be broken, battered.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.280]   You may have been abused.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.440]   You may have, you may even struggle
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.840]   to get up in the mornings
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.520]   because of the pain that you have suffered.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.060]   How do you forgive?
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.300]   You allow the grace of God to surround your heart,
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.120]   and then you let God vindicate you.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:54.700]   This is not something you can do easily.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.280]   But thankfully, as we learned
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.640]   from last week's Talk by Promise,
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.040]   we don't do this in our own strength.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.440]   We do this by the grace and the power
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.480]   and the love and the mercy
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.120]   of the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.440]   Let Him wrap His grace around your heart,
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.720]   and then let Him vindicate you.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:23.640]   So if it's so powerful,
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.880]   if that's what we do scripturally,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.180]   if that's what we do physically,
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.080]   what are we supposed to do with this?
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.220]   What now?
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.080]   Am I supposed to forgive in every situation?
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.040]   Am I supposed to just say,
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.100]   "Oh, I forgive you.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.060]   "You can do whatever you want to me
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.140]   "because I'm gonna forgive you."
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:44.740]   Let me say this, and I cannot say this any stronger.
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:48.360]   If you are currently in a situation of abuse,
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.140]   physical, sexual, emotional, psychological abuse,
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.480]   get out.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.940]   Talk to somebody.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.700]   To live a life of forgiveness
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.620]   doesn't mean you have to accept abuse.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.960]   Get safe, get out, talk to someone.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.660]   If you don't trust a family member,
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:07.740]   go and talk to a friend.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.740]   If you don't trust friends,
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.660]   go and talk to some of the pastoral team.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.180]   If you don't trust them, go and talk to a counselor,
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.820]   but do not accept the abuse that's happening.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.220]   I'm personally a mandatory reporter.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.340]   If I see or hear about anything
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.020]   in the realm of physical or sexual abuse,
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.740]   I am mandated to report it directly to the police.
[00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.020]   Now, I don't know about that in Hong,
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.540]   I don't know what the laws are in Hong Kong,
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.660]   but that's what I practice,
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.060]   and I know there's nuance here,
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.620]   but do not accept abuse
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.940]   just because you think that's the Christian way.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.940]   Get help, get out, and get safe.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.820]   In fact, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.940]   the QR code for Oasis Counseling Center.
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.020]   This is the counseling center
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.020]   that's attached to the Vine Church.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.140]   Now, if those of you who need it,
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.980]   I wanna ask you to do it,
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.500]   but to protect the identity of those
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.660]   who genuinely need to reach out,
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.940]   I'm gonna ask all of you to take out your phones
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.060]   and just at least do the act of it
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.860]   so that someone who really needs it
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.100]   is not feeling like, oh, everybody's looking at me.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.320]   Obviously, I need help,
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.620]   so let's all do it.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.820]   Now, some of you who are laughing and doing this,
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.220]   you need to go!
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.540]   So let's just protect those who really need it,
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.460]   but if any of you need to get out
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.780]   and you don't know what to do,
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.500]   please contact our counseling team.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.600]   They would love to,
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.140]   all of our trained professional counselors
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.440]   would love to talk to you.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.940]   But let's say you're clear of the abuse.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.500]   Maybe it happened a while ago,
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.100]   weeks, months, years, maybe even decades,
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.940]   but that phrase, dominated by resentment, still stands.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.700]   Maybe when you think of what happened to you
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:41.160]   or what was done to you,
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.860]   you still have rage or anger or pain
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.920]   or you want vengeance or,
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.820]   it's just uncontrollable, a negative response.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.580]   And I bet you some of you are looking at me
[00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:54.420]   and intently you're saying,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.540]   "You don't know how hard it was.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.080]   "You don't know how painful it was.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.620]   "You don't know what I've been through, Derek."
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.540]   And you're right, I'll never know,
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.460]   but Jesus does.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:12.660]   Jesus knows every single thing that has happened.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:18.260]   And you can say to me, "Oh, well, why wasn't he there?
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.900]   "Why did he allow this to happen?"
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:25.900]   I will never be able to explain that to you.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.220]   And I'm not even gonna try.
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.820]   I'm not even gonna try.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:34.480]   But I wanna tell you that Jesus understands your pain.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:40.180]   The perfect, sinless Son of God came to earth
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.320]   to experience life on earth to its fullness.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.340]   And near the end of his life,
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:52.340]   he was accused of being a blasphemer,
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.300]   tortured, stripped down, humiliated,
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.460]   forced to wear a crown of thorns, paraded through the city
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.980]   for nothing of his wrongdoing of his own.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.340]   But because he went to take yours and my sin.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.540]   You think Jesus doesn't understand betrayal?
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:16.080]   You think Jesus doesn't understand pain and suffering?
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.020]   He absolutely understands it.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.840]   Luke 23.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.660]   And when they came to the place that's called Skull,
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.180]   there they crucified him being Jesus with the criminals.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.740]   They treated him, our Savior, as a criminal
[00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.900]   because of my sin.
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.060]   And they hung him there,
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.220]   bleeding, alone.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:51.220]   And what does he say?
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.420]   He said, "Father, forgive them,
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.020]   for they know not what they do."
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:05.020]   Our Savior, in the midst of being betrayed
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.780]   by the very people he came to save,
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.360]   he says, "Forgive them."
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.780]   This is our God.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:20.900]   See, forgiveness is the central core aspect of our faith.
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.600]   There's no justification, there's no sanctification,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.920]   there's no nothing without forgiveness.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.440]   We don't have a faith,
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.720]   we don't have a Savior without forgiveness.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.260]   And so the only way we can experience the true fullness
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.840]   of what God has for us is that we receive that forgiveness
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.240]   and then we extend it to others.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   Because if we don't, who are we to say,
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.300]   we receive all that forgiveness and then we say,
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.680]   "No, I'm not gonna forgive others."
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.400]   Then we become a block to the love
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.920]   and the power of forgiveness in this world
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.140]   because we hoard it for ourselves.
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:03.880]   Or we don't think Jesus has the power to forgive,
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.700]   which both is not true.
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.900]   Is forgiveness easy?
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.680]   No, it's absolutely not.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.640]   But thankfully we have the person of Jesus
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.400]   in the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.200]   I'm not gonna tell you what to do.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.400]   I'm going to ask the Holy Spirit to do that.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.680]   I'm gonna share one last story, can I get the pen?
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:34.160]   I grew up in a Chinese family,
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.640]   my parents are from Hong Kong
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.480]   and my dad emigrated to the States,
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.000]   had a great upbringing there
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.120]   and then we came back to Hong Kong
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.980]   and I lived the expat life.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.040]   I went to island school,
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.440]   if there's anyone who went to island school.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.140]   I went to, you know, I was able to have all the things,
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:51.740]   you know, tennis club, golf club, woohoo.
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:52.700]   I lived the life, right?
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.040]   I even went to university in the States.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   So my father being a very Chinese man
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   loved us in the way that Chinese men do.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.920]   He provided for us, right?
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.560]   Did I have a relationship with my father?
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.600]   No.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.840]   Did I sit down and talk to my dad
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.960]   about all my hopes and dreams?
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.800]   No.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.280]   Did I sit there and just ask him how his day was?
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.220]   No, that's not the relationship that I have with my father.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:25.260]   In the late stages of his life,
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.340]   he had severe dementia
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.260]   and a number of other ailments with his body
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.860]   but then he developed a cancer in his jawbone
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.300]   and because his overall health was so poor,
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.020]   the doctors said we cannot operate on him,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.740]   he won't survive the operation.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.060]   So essentially they said there's nothing we can do.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.900]   So we just tried in the later stages of his life
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.560]   to have his quality of life as positive as it could be
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.260]   but the cancer grew to a point
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.960]   where it fused his mouth shut
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.980]   so he could no longer chew
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.340]   and if there was one thing that my father loved doing,
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.200]   it was eating.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.540]   He was diabetic but he loved his ice creams
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.900]   and he loved fatty chasiu, it was just ridiculous.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.100]   But once he could no longer take solid food,
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.100]   he just disintegrated, right?
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.560]   And so we're very thankful that he didn't suffer very long
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.660]   but ultimately he succumbed to the cancer.
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:19.640]   A few hours after he passed, I was outside in the hospital,
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.280]   outside the operating room
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.840]   and I was able to go and say my farewell to my father
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.060]   just a few hours passed.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.900]   I stood there
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:35.260]   and I said, "Dad, thank you so much for the life
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.660]   "that you provided for me."
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.820]   Then I found myself saying,
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:41.680]   "You know, Dad, I forgive you for not being the father
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.640]   "I wish you were."
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.740]   And I would love to tell you that I had this wave of emotion
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.520]   of tears of joy and this just release,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.420]   but I didn't.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.240]   You know what I felt?
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.220]   Shame.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.860]   I don't have very many regrets in my life
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.680]   but I felt in that moment, shame.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:07.820]   Because why didn't I care enough to say this to my father
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.100]   when he was of sound mind and of sound health
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.780]   so that we could actually build the relationship
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:16.780]   that I wish we had?
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:21.520]   So what I'm saying is when it comes to forgiveness,
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.800]   don't be like me.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.040]   Don't wait.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.460]   'Cause then you don't know if you have the chance.
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:35.580]   Why don't we all stand here today?
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.260]   Amen.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:47.740]   Maybe if you could just close your eyes.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.380]   Heavenly Father, I thank you for every single person
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.980]   here in this room and everyone online who's watching.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.260]   I don't know their story.
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.460]   I don't know their pain.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.620]   I don't know where they're at, but you do.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:09.620]   So Father, I ask right now by the power and mercy
[00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.020]   and grace of your Holy Spirit,
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.000]   come and minister to your people now.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.740]   It is not in our strength that we can do this,
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.180]   but wrap your grace around our hearts
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.740]   and help us to be conjurants of forgiveness.
[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:33.440]   No matter how painful or difficult it is,
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.020]   Jesus, you promise that you are with us.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:41.700]   So guide us now, minister to us,
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.280]   and we thank you in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.860]   (gentle music)
