[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   Can we thank our worship team and just awesome.
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.200]   (congregation applauding)
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.480]   Have a seat, have a seat.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.620]   We're pretty packed in here today.
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.860]   So if you need some seats, there are some seats,
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.720]   I think somewhere, but there are some seats around.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.100]   Again, welcome if you're joining us online.
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.480]   If you're in our overflow, we love you guys.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.560]   We're sorry that you're there,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.600]   but we're glad you're with us.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.680]   And there is no second class Holy Spirit
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.760]   in the name of Jesus.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.680]   Amen.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.800]   So we're glad that you're with us as well.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.800]   In 2014, something happened here at the Vine.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.560]   It was in the summer of 2014.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.280]   There's something happened here at the Vine
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.280]   that so changed, completely changed my expectations
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.700]   of the work of Christ in the world today.
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.560]   On this particular Sunday, a 25 year old French lady
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.760]   from a Muslim background walked into Pacific Coffee
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.640]   downstairs in search of her Sunday morning caffeine fix.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.160]   She had no idea that she had just walked into a church.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.380]   She thought she was just coming in to get a cup of coffee,
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.400]   but she was struck immediately by the reality
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.960]   that this Pacific Coffee was the most popular
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.680]   Pacific Coffee she had ever seen in her life.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.440]   It was filled with lots and lots of people
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.640]   who were chatting and laughing and hanging out and talking.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.960]   And she was used to her Sunday morning caffeine fix
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.600]   normally being a quiet, sleepy kind of vibe,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.880]   but here it was loud and raucous.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.440]   She grabbed her coffee and she couldn't find a seat
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.560]   in Pacific Coffee 'cause it was so full.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.260]   So she went and she stood by the stairs
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.320]   at the back of our Pacific Coffee,
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.160]   by the stairs that go up into the rest of our building.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.660]   And as she's standing there sipping her coffee,
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.360]   marveling at how a rock concert has just finished
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.880]   in this space, suddenly a asylum seeker,
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.760]   one of our asylum seekers kids trips
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.320]   and falls down the stairs right in front of her.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.720]   And immediately she looks around to see
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.080]   if the parent is there and if the parent
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.240]   is gonna react and respond, but she couldn't see a parent.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.640]   And so she turned and she knelt down to help this kid up.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.020]   Now, thankfully he wasn't seriously hurt at all,
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.600]   but she helps him up.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.000]   And because she speaks French, that's her mother language,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.360]   she just starts speaking to him in French.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.640]   I think when you panic and something like that happens,
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   you just default to your natural language.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.200]   She started speaking to him in French.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.040]   Amazingly though, this little boy was from West Africa
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.720]   and French was his mother tongue as well.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.360]   And so he was able to talk to her in French
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.120]   and he grabs her by the hand
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.680]   and he starts walking her up the stairs.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.880]   And she thinks that Pacific Coffee
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.920]   must have a second level to it
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.920]   and that the parents are up there somewhere
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.320]   and so she follows him as he's leading her up the stairs.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.200]   He leads her up the first floor, up to the second floor.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.320]   He leads her into the doors right here,
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.160]   right as the worship is starting for our 11 o'clock service.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.560]   And as he leads her in, he then lets go of her hand
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.520]   and he runs away.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.480]   And she's standing there wondering what is going on.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.100]   For the next 90 minutes,
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.600]   the majority of the next 90 minutes,
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.840]   she's just stood right there
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.280]   and she's crying and crying and crying
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.160]   and she has no idea why she's crying.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.560]   She describes it to me just a few months later
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.680]   as if this warmth had just come over her.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.480]   And she said she had never felt a sense of love or peace
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.880]   like that in her life ever before.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.680]   At the end of the service,
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   she comes forward speaking in French,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.200]   trying to find somebody who speaks French.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.760]   Thankfully, there was a French family that was sitting
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.480]   just a couple of rows towards the front
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.360]   and we were able to connect them together.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.080]   And over the process of a conversation right there
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.400]   and then at the front of the church,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.520]   this Muslim lady gives her life to Jesus.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   Just a few months later,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.400]   she does Alpha for the first time.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.480]   She does our French Alpha.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.720]   We were running a French speaking Alpha at that time.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.240]   She commits, further commits her life to Christ
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.200]   through Alpha.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.120]   I had the privilege of baptizing her
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.720]   just a few months later.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.760]   She then was one of the leaders
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.000]   on our next French Alpha that we ran
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920]   and she had the privilege of leading
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.800]   some other people to Jesus.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.920]   She then came and stood in front of our whole church
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.920]   on a Sunday and told them the story that I've just told you.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.000]   And then she left us just a few months later
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.960]   and she's now living and working again in France.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.760]   Now, I would love to stand here this morning
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.840]   and tell you that story and tell you that the reason
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.040]   why this lady gave her life to Jesus
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.720]   is 'cause the Vine Church has an amazing
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.040]   evangelistic program.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.960]   That we have trained people to be on the lookout
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.560]   for strangers entering into Pacific Coffee
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.640]   on a Sunday morning.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.440]   I would like to tell you that we've trained
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.680]   all our asylum seeker kids to fake fall down the stairs.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.040]   They're like little stunt kids
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.560]   that fake fall down the stairs
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.840]   so that they can speak in French
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.520]   to random French speaking people who walk in.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.320]   I would like to tell you that we have brought
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.560]   all of our French families to the front rows of the church
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.960]   just in case a French person comes into this church
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.800]   who's no Jesus.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.640]   I'd like to tell you that 'cause then I could pretend
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.160]   that the reason why this person gave their life to Jesus
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.400]   is 'cause the Vine is so awesome
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.120]   and that we have such a great evangelistic program
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.000]   but I love the fact that I can't stand here
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.360]   and tell you that.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.880]   I love the fact that the only reason
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.680]   that that woman came to Christ on that day
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.440]   was 'cause God believed it was her time.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.600]   Because God did it all.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.920]   That there was, I mean think about it,
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.800]   coming into this particular Pacific Coffee
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.160]   for a caffeine fix.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.040]   So busy that she couldn't sit
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.600]   so she had to stand at the back.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.840]   It just so happens that a French speaking refugee kid
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.920]   is able to connect with her who just randomly brings her up
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.600]   and makes her stand right there and then runs away.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   And there happened to be a French family
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.480]   that was willing to share the gospel with her.
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.360]   I mean we can't make this stuff up.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.080]   This is stuff that can only ever be done
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.280]   by a God who is able to do immeasurably more
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.880]   than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.200]   And when something like that happens,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   you can only stand back and go, God is amazing.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.160]   Not the vine is amazing.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.640]   Our evangelistic programs are amazing.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.640]   God, who is able to do more than we could ever ask
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.080]   or imagine and because God did it that way,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.640]   that story is still one of my most favorite stories
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.400]   to share in some 15 years of pastoring here at the church.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.760]   The apostle Paul knew something of a God
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.600]   who was just like that.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.880]   A God who was able to do more
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.000]   than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.280]   In fact, as he finishes his prayer in Ephesians 3,
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.560]   that majestic glorious prayer that we looked at last week,
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.160]   he decides to finish it by shifting the focus of his prayer
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.240]   back to this God, which is important for Paul
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.500]   because he's just prayed a passionate pastoral prayer
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.760]   for his church.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.360]   I mean, he needs to spend all this time saying,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.000]   my hope for you is that out of the glorious riches
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.360]   of Christ Jesus, that he would strengthen you with power
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.480]   by his spirit in your inner being.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.880]   I mean, my prayer for you is that you would know
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.600]   that Christ lives in your heart.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.680]   And because of that, you would be able to grasp
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.520]   how wide and high and deep and long the vastness
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.440]   of the love of Christ for you.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.200]   And because that, you would know that love,
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.160]   experience that love, feel that love
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.200]   so that you would be filled to the whole measure
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.440]   of the wholeness of Christ.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.600]   He's just prayed this passionate pastoral prayer
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.900]   for his people to experience God in a way
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.880]   that they've never experienced it before,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.080]   but he gets to the end of the prayer
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.160]   and he realizes I can't finish there
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.060]   because God is always more than what we experience of him.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.880]   And despite the fact that he's passionately gone,
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.920]   I want you to really experience him,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.800]   what he's also saying to his churches,
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.840]   but I don't want to limit, and I don't want you
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.520]   to limit your expectations of God
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.200]   just by what you've experienced of him.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.880]   And so he shifts the end of his prayer
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.240]   back to the wonder and the majesty and the mystery
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.880]   and the glory of a God who's far greater
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.440]   than we could ever experience.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.220]   I want to read it to you.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.920]   He says this in Ephesians 3, verse 20 and 21.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.880]   Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.800]   than we could ask or imagine,
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.040]   according to his power that is at work within us,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.920]   to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.560]   throughout all generations forever and ever.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.880]   And the whole church said, amen.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.620]   This is known as a doxology.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.240]   What it is is a exclamation
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.360]   that praises a characteristic of God
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.600]   that when read should cause you
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.640]   to enter into a place of worship as well.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.800]   Paul writes these doxologies throughout his letters,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.720]   and there are many that he includes.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.560]   This one is one of my particular favorites,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.920]   and I love it for one simple reason.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.920]   Paul is challenging his church deeply on something.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.800]   He's asking them, actually, through this doxology,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.920]   a very important question.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.800]   It's an important question 'cause he's about to enter
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.560]   into three more chapters in the letter,
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.280]   chapters four, five, and six,
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.160]   where he's gonna speak about the nature that we have
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.200]   and the way that we should live in respect to God.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   Before we get there, he finishes chapter three
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.040]   by asking his church a critical question.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.740]   Who exactly is it that you worship?
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.600]   That's what he wants to ask his church,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.080]   and that's what I sense the Holy Spirit
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.480]   wants to ask you here this morning.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.960]   Who exactly is it that you worship?
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.320]   And this is an important question for Paul
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.200]   because before he tells his church
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.040]   how they should now live in response to this God,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.800]   he wants to make sure that they're worshiping the right God.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.280]   And as you come into church today,
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.320]   you might be like, well, of course I'm worshiping
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   the right God, Andrew.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.600]   I'm in a Christian church today and not somewhere else.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.880]   I believe in Jesus.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.960]   Of course I'm worshiping the right God.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.280]   Paul's being a lot more nuanced than that,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.720]   a lot more, actually, I think, challenging than that.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.160]   And when I read this doxology,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.440]   I find myself deeply challenged.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.380]   I've read this for years, and every time I read it,
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.480]   I'm reminded of my own deficiencies.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.960]   I'm actually reminded of how I so often can drift
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   in my worship away from worshiping the God of Scripture
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.700]   and settling instead for worshiping the God
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.780]   that I have experienced.
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.520]   Are you tracking with me here?
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.600]   Now, I want you to track with this
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.680]   'cause I think we can all make this mistake
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.320]   in our Christian lives, that we end up so much
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.000]   worshiping the God that we have actually
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.540]   tangibly had an experience of,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.900]   but we kind of settle or we see that as the roof,
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:58.080]   the ceiling of our understanding of who he is.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.120]   And so our worship, the God that we're worshiping,
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.160]   is essentially a God that we have experienced
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.480]   rather than the God of the nature and the character
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.080]   and the power and the fullness
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.560]   of how Scripture describes him to us.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.120]   And this is very true for us,
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.560]   particularly when we've been disappointed by God.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.840]   And if you're anything like me in this room,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.440]   you've been disappointed by God sometimes.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.760]   When we get disappointed by God
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.860]   or maybe God hasn't come through like we expected
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.240]   or our experience of God is not like the experience
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.680]   of the person next to us,
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.560]   and they seem to cry every time they worship.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.440]   They seem to get the gift of tongues
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.400]   and I don't seem to get that.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.980]   And we begin to compare our experience with God
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.940]   with somebody else's experience of God,
[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.700]   and we end up worshiping a God limited by our experience,
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.820]   and we can feel sometimes dejected in that
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.020]   because our experience is not someone else's experience,
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.700]   and Paul writes to the church and says,
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.380]   "Hang on a sec, I want you to experience God.
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.060]   I mean, I've just prayed this majestic prayer
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.180]   that you would feel his love
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.580]   like you've never felt him before.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.660]   Everything in my being desires for you to experience him
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.540]   in the greatest way you could ever experience him,
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.680]   but never limit your thinking or your expectations,
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.140]   particularly never limit your worship
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.860]   just based on how you've experienced him.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.660]   It's got to be so much more."
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.660]   So if I was to ask Paul's question
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.100]   through this doxology to us as a modern church
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.180]   in a modern way, perhaps I'd ask it like this.
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.960]   Are you worshiping the God of your truth
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.260]   above the God of the truth?
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.220]   Say that again.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.680]   Are you worshiping the God of your truth
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.940]   over and above the God of the truth?
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.220]   Have you limited God simply to your own experience of him,
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:52.020]   whether good or bad, or are you able to worship him
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.780]   even beyond what it is that you may have experienced?
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.220]   Paul writes to the church, "Oh, now to him
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.260]   who is able to do, whether you've experienced a lot
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.660]   or a little, far more than you could ever have thought,
[00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.940]   that's the God to worship."
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.320]   I wanna actually show you how Paul does this.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.680]   I'm gonna break this down in this doxology
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.340]   because I think it's really important
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.780]   that we wrestle with the challenge of this,
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.180]   but also I believe because we wanna raise glory
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.060]   in the church, and I think this is the whole of Paul's point.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.740]   He talks about three elements in this doxology.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.060]   The first element is you.
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:36.140]   Can you see that on the screen?
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.700]   Wow, modern technology, look at that.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.780]   By the way, I've said this before,
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.300]   I'm gonna say it again.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.000]   I am terrible at writing.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.860]   But just track with the ugliness of my words written down
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.140]   and follow what we're doing here.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.620]   When Paul says God is able to do immeasurably more
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.180]   than we could ever ask or imagine,
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.180]   there's an assumption Paul's making in that statement.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.880]   Do you know what that assumption is?
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.420]   It's not a rhetorical question, it is actually a question.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.180]   What is the assumption he's making?
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.920]   'Cause if God can do more than you ever ask or imagine,
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.000]   what is he actually assuming?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.900]   That you are asking and that you are imagining,
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.920]   which maybe for some churches, that's a big assumption.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.820]   But he's assuming of his church in Ephesus
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.980]   that they are actually doing two things,
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.980]   that they are asking, which is this idea of prayer,
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.200]   and that they are, the word he uses in the Greek,
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.260]   this idea of imagine, which we could think of it
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.420]   as like a dream, like dreaming, or like a vision,
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.140]   or the way in which we think, these things.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.160]   The idea of our mind being engaged in life
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.140]   and what we hope and dream for life.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.260]   Paul's assumption is that the church that you are praying
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.100]   and you're dreaming, that you are on your knees
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.460]   praying out for God to do some things in your life
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.100]   to shape and to work your life in certain ways,
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.740]   that you have a passion and a heart
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.820]   to believe that prayer can change things.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.440]   And that you're not just praying for yourself,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.060]   but you're praying for our city of Hong Kong
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.740]   in such an important time as this,
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.380]   and that the church together is praying and believing.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.940]   He's assuming that that's what's happening.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.500]   He's also assuming that you're not just praying,
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.700]   but you're dreaming, that you've got some ideas,
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.540]   that you're thinking,
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.360]   that the thoughts of your mind are hopeful,
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.580]   that you're dreaming for a better future for Hong Kong,
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.660]   that you're dreaming for a better future for yourself
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.460]   and for your family, that that future
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.160]   is not just some future out there,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.280]   but is rooted in the kingdom and rooted in God's heart,
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.860]   that you're imagining what it would look like
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.820]   if the kingdom of God came to earth
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.140]   just like Jesus prayed about in his prayer,
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.140]   that it would be on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.940]   There's stuff that's going on in your mind and your heart
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.140]   that you're passionate about.
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.280]   This idea of praying and this idea of imagining and dreaming,
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.060]   Paul says this important thing.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.060]   He says, "According to the power that is at work in you."
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.900]   So he says that there's a power that God does
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.160]   to help us to pray and help us to dream,
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.000]   which is really important.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.300]   You're not praying and you're not dreaming
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.580]   or imagining in a vacuum.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.020]   The power he mentions here is that power
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.820]   he's just prayed about in the prayer in a few verses earlier
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.060]   that you would be strengthened with power
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.220]   by the spirit in your inner being.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.260]   He's like, "That power is already at work in you,
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.700]   for you have already been rooted and established in love.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.140]   And because that power is at work in you,
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.060]   you can trust that the prayers that you're praying
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.980]   are on the heart of God.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.680]   You can trust that the dreams and the imaginations
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.200]   that you hold in your heart have been placed there
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.400]   and are being fanned into flame by the spirit of God.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.600]   It is a wonderful, beautiful thing."
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.440]   God doesn't ask his church to pray and leave it in a vacuum.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.040]   He asks his church to pray and he asks his church to dream
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.440]   for a better future, but then he puts his power inside of us
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.920]   to enable us to do that in a way
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.240]   that brings true fruit in this world.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.280]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.400]   No one thinks that's beautiful.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.100]   Is that beautiful?
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.800]   Now notice, he then says this though.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.980]   He says, "That's all that is assumed here."
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.300]   But notice this, he then says,
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.320]   "But there is this role that God plays."
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.460]   And I'm gonna use my high school level maths here.
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.720]   There's a sign in maths, greater than.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.560]   Do you see this?
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.060]   This is greater than, look at that.
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:34.020]   He says that God, here's what you need to know about God.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.900]   God is able to do greater than, more than you could ever ask
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.300]   and more than you could ever dream.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.580]   And he's saying, if you want to worship God,
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.860]   who exactly is the God that you worship?
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.260]   He's like, you have to worship the one who is abundantly,
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.020]   immeasurably more than you could ever dream,
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.160]   more than you could ever imagine.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.780]   'Cause he is so grand, so vast.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.940]   His ways are higher than your ways.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.100]   His thoughts are greater than your thoughts.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.340]   And if you've just limited him
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.700]   to your own experience of him,
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.860]   you need to break yourself out of that.
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.580]   And he says, here's how you do it.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.740]   You believe in a God who is immeasurably more
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.000]   than you have ever dreamt or imagined.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.740]   What a glorious thing he's saying here.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.740]   Now, I want you to see this,
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.540]   the problem we have in the church,
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.700]   the problem I think we have in us.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.700]   I want that one, that one, thank you.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.980]   The problem we have is that we get stuck,
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.240]   notice this, on this side of the equation
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.300]   I think all the time.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.560]   And we get stuck on that side of the equation
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.020]   for I think important reason.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.420]   Listen to this.
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.860]   It is hard to believe in a God
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.980]   who can do immeasurably more
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.580]   than we could ever ask and imagine
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.580]   if we don't first believe in a God
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.380]   who can actually do what we ask and imagine.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.420]   Are you with me?
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.380]   I mean, it's hard, right?
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.740]   To take the jump over that equation
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.020]   to an immeasurably more God
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.020]   if we're already struggling to have the faith to believe
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.620]   that he could actually do what we believe that he could do,
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.180]   that we actually believe that he could answer the prayers
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.300]   that we're currently praying.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.560]   And this is why this doxology for me is so challenging
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.540]   'cause I have to reflect on my own faith
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.780]   and ask, do I really believe that God could do
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.740]   even just what I'm praying,
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.260]   let alone immeasurably more?
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.260]   I just need to get through
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.160]   the first part of the equation here.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.500]   If you're anything like me,
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.940]   there's been seasons in your life
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.520]   and maybe you're in one of those seasons right now
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.980]   where you're actually struggling to believe
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.860]   that God can answer your prayers.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.020]   You're actually honestly struggling to believe
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.420]   that he could really come through with a vision
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.820]   or a hope or a dream that you might have.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.240]   When that happens,
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.580]   maybe you haven't given up on your relationship with God,
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.420]   but here's what happens.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.740]   You actually end up settling for worshiping
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.980]   what I would argue is the not enough God.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.620]   No, you still believe in Jesus.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.700]   You still come to church every Sunday,
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.340]   but because perhaps your prayers
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.900]   haven't been answered on a regular basis,
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.420]   perhaps you took that step of faith
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.340]   out into a business venture and it didn't work out.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.220]   Perhaps you invited that person out on a date
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.820]   and they said no.
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.940]   Perhaps you tried to do something in faith
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.300]   and you felt and you had all your prayer partners pray,
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.740]   everybody prayed, everybody said,
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.900]   yeah, this is what you should do.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.580]   And you took that big step of faith
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.740]   and it didn't work out and that hurt.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.820]   And you felt a little bit let down by God
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.460]   and you felt like God was on mute in your life.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.860]   And because that was so painful,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.340]   because it was so public and you had done that step of faith,
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.060]   you've actually kind of stepped back from that.
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.380]   And you've said, I don't know if God
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.580]   does always answer prayers
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.200]   because he hasn't always answered mine.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.100]   I still believe in him,
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.180]   but I'm not sure if he's really enough.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.340]   And so some of us get stuck
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.140]   on the first side of the equation here
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:02.260]   because we're actually worshiping the not enough God.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.460]   And maybe we would never would have put a label on it
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.100]   until today, but if you're honest with yourself,
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.800]   you know you're part of that camp.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.440]   God is just not enough for me.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.340]   The good news is, is I think that most of us
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.660]   kind of push through that reality at some point in our lives
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.700]   and we end up then worshiping what I would call
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.140]   the just enough God.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.100]   And the just enough God sounds a lot better
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.340]   than the not enough God,
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.080]   but it is still a deficient God that we worship.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.780]   The just enough God is the God
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.100]   that actually does answer the prayers that we pray
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.900]   and does come through for the dreams that we hold.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.020]   I mean, track with this.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.340]   If I had said to you that there is a church in Hong Kong
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.560]   where everybody in that church believes
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:49.580]   that God answers prayers and God comes through on dreams,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.140]   I think you'd wanna be a part of that church, amen?
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.660]   Wouldn't you wanna go to a church
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.900]   where everybody in that church
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.380]   actually believes that Jesus answers prayers,
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.940]   actually believes that God has visions and dreams
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.820]   and those things can actually happen in the world?
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.940]   Wouldn't that be an amazingly exciting church
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.260]   to be a part of?
[00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:07.760]   It would, but it would be a church
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.360]   that's worshiping the wrong God.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.720]   If I was to say to you at the beginning of this sermon
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.700]   that God could answer every single prayer you've ever prayed
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.620]   and come through for every dream that you could ever dream
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.380]   and are you happy to worship that God,
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.980]   I'm sure all of us would have said,
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.580]   sign me up on the bottom line.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.420]   That's the God I wanna worship, amen?
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.740]   We think so, yes.
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.060]   In fact, we think that that's the very definition
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.740]   of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.300]   Oh man, I'm a Christian.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.020]   I actually believe that God can answer prayer.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.780]   I actually believe that He does come through in dreams.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.140]   I mean, that's what I'm supposed to believe, right?
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.740]   I do believe my level of faith is at that level
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.100]   and we think that that's right
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.160]   and Paul comes and says, if that's what you believe,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.060]   you're still worshiping the wrong God.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.580]   You're worshiping the wrong God
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.260]   because you have limited Him still
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.900]   to what you're praying for and what you're believing in.
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.380]   And even though His spirit is at work in those things,
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.340]   as he's just said, His power is at work in you,
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.980]   if you limit God to just answering your prayers
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.660]   and just coming through for your dreams,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.260]   you still created a ceiling for God.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.260]   You've still placed Him in your box.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.820]   It's still a God of your truth.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.620]   And Paul wants to pull his church broader
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.100]   and bigger than that and he's saying,
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.220]   you've got to worship not the not enough God,
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.860]   not the just enough God,
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.060]   the God that he calls us to worship
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:32.720]   is really long word that takes ages to write,
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.220]   the immeasurably more God.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.060]   He's like, this is the God that you are to worship.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.660]   Man, that's bad writing, but you know what I'm trying to say.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.800]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.900]   That looks like the immeasurably mowed God.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.700]   No, He's not the immeasurably mowed.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.740]   He's like, this is the God.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.820]   Like if there's a God you are to believe in your church,
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.940]   it's not just one that's limited to the ceiling
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.380]   of what you can pray and what you can believe for,
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.300]   even though you can pray and believe for some great stuff.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.540]   No, He's always bigger, always greater, always more vast.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.340]   His ways are always higher than our ways.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.260]   And if you're gonna worship a God,
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.620]   you worship the immeasurably more God,
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.260]   the one who can do way more
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.140]   than you could ever ask or imagine.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.420]   The one who can take a 25 year old French girl
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.980]   who has never stood foot in a church before
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.100]   and so fill her with the love of Christ
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.300]   that she would come forward and say, what is going on here?
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:31.020]   And God could save her because that's what God does.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.220]   We never prayed for that.
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.420]   We never asked for that.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.260]   I wanna be honest with you.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.580]   I don't think we ever had the faith for that
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.560]   until it happened.
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.420]   And God is the immeasurably more God.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.680]   Now that becomes our ceiling.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.960]   I expect that now at the Bind.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.940]   By the way, if you're a stranger in this room, welcome.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.700]   It's good to have you with us.
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.860]   You're about to get saved.
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.700]   It's awesome.
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.300]   We're so glad you're here.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.300]   That's now my ceiling, but now God's light.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.860]   You gotta believe for more than that then
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.340]   'cause he's always the immeasurably more God.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.340]   Are you with me?
[00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.860]   Are you tracking with this?
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.920]   Now, then Paul finishes everything that he's saying.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.980]   Woo, that got big.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.060]   He finishes it by saying there's a third element.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.340]   He said, then there's this reality of the church.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.580]   I love this.
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.500]   And he says the church,
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.100]   when God is the immeasurably more God
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.420]   and the church worships the immeasurably more God,
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.100]   he says then glory is seen in that church.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.580]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.500]   It's almost as if a church has limited itself
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.520]   to either the not enough God or the just enough God,
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.900]   then it's gonna be lacking the glory of Christ in it.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.740]   If you want the church to see and to feel
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.880]   and reveal the glory of Christ,
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.460]   then we have to worship the immeasurably more God
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.420]   'cause when you worship the immeasurably more God,
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.220]   his glory, Paul says, is seen in the church.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.260]   It's seen in the church because when that French lady
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.020]   stood in front of a room of this size
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.820]   and shared the story that I shared with you,
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.780]   I mean, it was hopefully impactful when I shared it.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.620]   Could you imagine when she shared it?
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.780]   Worship on that Sunday in this place
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.780]   was just off the records, off the charts
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.980]   because glory was seen in the church.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.460]   And why was it glory?
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.800]   Because the church could not take any credit for it.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.300]   It happened and everybody stood back and said,
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.500]   only God could have done that.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.020]   And if only God could have done it, we worship that God.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.540]   We're not worshiping a platform or a speaker
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.100]   or a type of worship or a preacher.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.260]   We're worshiping God because that could only
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.860]   have ever happened by one who is able to do
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.060]   immeasurably more than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.940]   And when we see it take place,
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.540]   how can glory not be seen in the church?
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.060]   How can the church not respond in saying,
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.500]   praise God, you are glorified, as Paul said,
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.780]   in Christ Jesus, that the works of Christ
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.500]   are raised in the midst.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:05.300]   The way that a church can glory God
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.500]   is simply by providing an arena in which
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.540]   that the work of Jesus Christ can take effect.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.220]   That's how a church glorifies God.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.700]   It actually gets out of the way
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.960]   and enables Christ to do his work.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:28.840]   And that's what we wanna do here today.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.980]   And as much as it was important for you
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.540]   to understand what Paul's finishing his prayers with here,
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.740]   and I hope as we've mapped it out for you,
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.980]   it's inspired you and challenged you.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.860]   But the reason why we've done it here this morning
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.540]   is because of what it leads us to.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.580]   It leads us to actually providing an arena
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.100]   in which the work of Jesus Christ
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.820]   can actually take effect amongst us.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.720]   For quite some time now, as a community of leaders here,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.100]   we've been praying for this Sunday,
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.260]   and we've been praying for this Sunday
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.580]   because we knew that we were gonna be setting aside time now
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.900]   for prayer and ministry.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.520]   We want to actually lean into the radical idea
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.240]   of the immeasurably more God that is amongst us.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.300]   What we're gonna do in a moment
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.380]   is I'm gonna invite you all to stand.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.420]   And we've been praying for what are some things
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.860]   that we can pray for you for and lay hands on you.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.220]   Our elders, our pastoral team, our prayer,
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.240]   innocences and prayer ministry team
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.860]   have prepared themselves for today.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.060]   And what's gonna happen is we're gonna name
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.540]   a couple of things that we feel the Holy Spirit
[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.720]   wants to minister to our people in today.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.120]   And if that resonates for you,
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.420]   we're gonna ask you to have the courage today.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.380]   If you're in this room, if you're in the lower house here,
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.500]   to come and stand here at the front in the middle.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.700]   If you're in the upper house,
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.540]   we have space at the front set aside today for this.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:52.220]   You can come and stand at the front in the upper house.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.500]   If it gets too busy up there,
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.420]   then you can actually come down to here as well.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.140]   But there is a prayer team with elders up there as well.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.320]   If you're in the overflow today,
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.720]   you can come inside here for prayer.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.580]   If you're online, you can contribute in this as well.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.460]   You can send your prayers to us at prayer@thevine.org.hk.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.900]   And we would love to be able to pray with you
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.560]   in this moment as well.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.260]   But we're going to take some time
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.860]   to actually put what we've been preaching into practice.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.340]   God is able to do immeasurably more
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.940]   than you could ever ask and imagine.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.660]   As I was praying and preparing for this ministry time,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.820]   I felt God say this to me,
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.420]   "Andrew, there are things that I wanna do in this church
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.620]   "that you have yet asked for or thought about.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.260]   "You haven't even asked or thought about them yet.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.800]   "There are things that I wanna do in this church
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.700]   "that you haven't yet even thought about or asked for."
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.700]   And as he spoke that to me,
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.180]   I felt like he was speaking it to you,
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.300]   and I wanna speak this over you.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.220]   "There are some things that God wants to do in you
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.900]   "that you have yet asked for or even thought about."
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.140]   And we're gonna make the space for that to happen now.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.380]   So would you all stand with me, and let's stand together.
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.940]   We're gonna stand in a posture of prayer together.
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.700]   (audience murmuring)
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.540]   And in a moment, I'm going to invite some people forward
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.160]   for a specific kind of prayer.
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   If this is you, if you resonate with it,
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.260]   then I want you to take the courage
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.020]   to come forward and be prayed for.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.620]   If it's not for you, that's fine.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.020]   You can continue just the worship.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.580]   We're gonna have some worship happening,
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.500]   but we also wanna encourage you.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.640]   We're gonna put it up on the screen,
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.380]   some of the things that we're praying about.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.260]   We wanna encourage you to pray.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.260]   Stretch your hands out, pray for the people in the middle
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.900]   that are being prayed for,
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.720]   so that we're all involved in praying and believing
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.100]   in the immeasurably more God together.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.740]   So the first thing and the strongest thing
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.600]   that we've sensed over the last couple of weeks
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.700]   as we've been preparing and praying for this time now
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.460]   is that we wanna pray for physical healing.
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.020]   We wanna pray specifically for people
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.740]   that have physical healing needs.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.500]   So whether that's a disease
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.100]   that you're currently battling with,
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.740]   whether it's like cancer or something like that
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.940]   that you're struggling with,
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.700]   whether you've hurt your ankle or your foot,
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.620]   whether you're suffering from migraines,
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.380]   whether there is some form of physical challenge
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.620]   that you're facing in your life right now,
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.780]   we specifically wanna pray.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.220]   We wanna lay hands on you.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.340]   We wanna believe that God is a God of miracles,
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.260]   that He can release us from the things that ail us,
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.180]   and particularly from physical things
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.480]   that are holding us down.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.700]   So the very first thing we're gonna be praying for
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.500]   is anyone in here at all
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.500]   that has some sort of physical challenge,
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.100]   ailment, sickness, disease right now,
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.060]   we wanna lay our hands on you and we wanna pray for you.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.960]   And so we're gonna do that.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.500]   So can I encourage you in the upper house
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.820]   just to come forward now towards the front
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.980]   so the prayer team can be praying for you.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.320]   If you're in here in the lower house or if you're outside,
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.100]   this is your space now to come forward.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.940]   Don't be shy, come on forward.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.380]   We're gonna pray for you, gonna lay hands on you.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.220]   We're gonna speak life over you
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:57.980]   and we're going to do that for you now.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.920]   So come on forward and let's spend some time
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.200]   believing and praying for the immeasurably more God over us.
