1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Everyone says, "Amen."

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 Good morning.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,520
 Good morning to our online community as well who are joining us.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,600
 Before I get started, during worship, there was a line from a movie that came into my head.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,280
 Some of you may have seen the movie, it's called The Holiday.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,200
 It's a Christmas movie.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:29,280
 And there's a music composer in this movie who writes music for movies.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,080
 That's his job.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,520
 And there's a scene in the movie where he writes a song for a new friend that he's made.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
 And he tells her, "I only used the best notes."

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,760
 And it came into my mind today that God would say to you today that when he composed you,

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,200
 when he put you together, he only used the best notes.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,440
 And some of you here today, I think there might be some people here who've been told otherwise.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,480
 And maybe you don't know the truth of what I've just said to you.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,280
 But God would say to you, when he put you together, when he composed your life,

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,440
 he only used the best notes.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:22,480
 I get to share the third sermon in our Advent series called Of Relatives and Rejection.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,600
 Let's start with reading from the Word.

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,120
 Luke 2, 1-7 says, "In those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,360
 the entire Roman world.

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,440
 This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,120
 And everyone went to their own town to register.

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:52,960
 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem,

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,560
 the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,000
 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
 and was expecting a child.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,480
 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,280
 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,360
 She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger,

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
 because there was no guest room available for them.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,960
 Now, hidden beneath these verses is a whole other story.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:35,760
 Joseph returns to the place he belongs, the place his family, his extended family, is from.

33
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,440
 And amongst all those people, not one of them opened their doors to Joseph.

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,080
 Not one of them found a small space in their dwelling

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,320
 where mats could be laid on the floor for this family.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,920
 Not one.

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,160
 And the reason was Mary.

38
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,600
 Mary was pledged to be married.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,880
 She was not yet married, but she's pregnant.

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,600
 She's with child.

41
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,200
 Their voices that this child was a miraculous gift from God had fallen on deaf ears.

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,920
 Mary and Joseph have brought shame on their family,

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
 and nobody wanted to go near them.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,120
 Nobody wanted their reputation to be tainted.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,680
 Mary and Joseph were rejected, and no room was available for them.

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,320
 And so they find themselves in a room made for animals.

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,640
 And Jesus is born.

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,720
 Mary wraps him up and places him in a food trough where the animals would normally eat from.

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,600
 Their comfort level?

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,840
 Maybe two out of ten.

51
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,200
 But what about the smell?

52
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
 Just stop for a minute.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,960
 Have you been in a room with livestock or where livestock were once inside?

54
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,360
 Not very pleasant.

55
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
 Maybe zero out of ten?

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,880
 Isaiah 53 says,

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,080
 "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering and acquainted with disease.

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,640
 He was despised as one from whom men hide their face, and we did not respect him.

59
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,640
 Even before Jesus was born, he was despised and rejected.

60
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,040
 His own flesh and blood hid their face from him."

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,720
 Now juxtapose this with smiling rosy faces, a roaring fire, Christmas stockings all in a line,

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,040
 smell of turkey wafting from the oven, beautifully wrapped gifts meticulously chosen,

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,760
 piled high under the exquisitely decorated Christmas tree,

64
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,600
 everyone in there matching Christmas jumpers, just like what Damien's wearing down here,

65
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,440
 or maybe matching Christmas pyjamas or Christmas socks,

66
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,440
 Michael Buble crooning away in the background.

67
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:22,240
 You see, putting the first Christmas experience beside our current expectations of what Christmas

68
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
 should be, there is a huge discrepancy.

69
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,320
 The first Christmas was messy, and Joseph and Mary were feeling very real feelings of

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,400
 rejection and loss, estranged from their family, isolated from a community that could only see

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:49,680
 an unwed mother, to now when we do everything we can to create the perfect Christmas experience

72
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:58,960
 for ourselves, even so far as deliberately avoiding any relatives who may potentially

73
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,920
 mess up our perfect Christmas.

74
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,480
 The problem with this is that we are not perfect.

75
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,960
 Life is not perfect.

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:18,640
 Rejection, loss, disappointment, imperfection, confusion is still as real and current today

77
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,360
 as it was at the very first Christmas.

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,440
 Maybe your story is similar to Jesus's.

79
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,800
 Maybe you know all too well what it's like to be rejected by your family.

80
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,760
 Maybe Christmas does not bring the family welcome or connection that it should.

81
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,960
 Maybe you're the only believer in your family.

82
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:51,440
 Christmas is not celebrated, and maybe your faith leaves you feeling lonely and at times

83
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,240
 despised.

84
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,400
 Rejection can close us off, but the first Christmas can give us hope.

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:08,720
 Yes, Joseph, Mary and Jesus were rejected by their relatives and left to fend for themselves,

86
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,520
 but others came to witness and share in the joy of that first Christmas.

87
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,360
 Wise men and shepherds.

88
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,480
 In Luke 2 verses 16 to 20, it records the joy and the praise and the treasured moments

89
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,640
 that were brought into Mary and Joseph's lives by the shepherd.

90
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:39,680
 Luke 2 verses 16 to 20 says, "So the shepherds hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and

91
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,160
 the baby who was lying in the manger.

92
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,320
 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this

93
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,640
 child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherd said to them.

94
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,760
 And Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.

95
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,200
 The shepherds returned glorifying, praising God for all the things they had heard and

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,680
 seen, which were just as they'd been told."

97
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,680
 You see, the beauty of Jesus's birth is that it created the opportunity for us all

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
 to be drawn back into family.

99
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,440
 You know, I have always loved Christmas.

100
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,200
 And as I was reflecting on this and on this sermon that I was preparing, I realized that

101
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:36,000
 Christmas was the time of my personal rejection and also the time of my adoption into my forever

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
 family.

103
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,040
 In 1973, some of you are working out how old I am right now.

104
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,280
 Let me save you the trouble, I'm turning 50 very soon.

105
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,080
 [Laughter]

106
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,760
 In 1973, four days before Christmas, I was born to an unwed schoolgirl.

107
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,000
 She brought shame on her family and she was sent away.

108
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,240
 To have me in secret in another part of Australia.

109
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:16,000
 I was put up for adoption and two weeks later, I was swept into my forever family.

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
 Adoption to me is the epitome of love.

111
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,480
 Where there is no blood connection and yet love comes and wraps you up as its own.

112
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,800
 Christmas undoes rejection.

113
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,160
 Jesus comes and he wraps you up as his own.

114
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,400
 We are all given the opportunity to be adopted into his love.

115
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:54,800
 I challenge you that if you struggle with rejection, let this Christmas be the one that

116
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
 begins to set you free.

117
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,880
 Let it be your adoption story.

118
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:09,360
 John 1 verses 12 to 14 says, "Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed

119
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,920
 in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."

120
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,680
 Children born not of natural descent, not of human decision or a husband's will, but

121
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
 born of God.

122
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
 The word became flesh.

123
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
 The word became flesh.

124
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,840
 Jesus made his dwelling among us.

125
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,840
 We've seen his glory, the glory of the one and only son who came from the father full

126
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,680
 of grace and truth.

127
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,040
 When you accept Jesus as your saviour, you are lovingly swept into his family.

128
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,760
 And you are lovingly swept into this family.

129
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,120
 And in a church of this size, no one should be alone this Christmas.

130
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,560
 There is a challenge here that I am deliberately giving to us all.

131
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:12,320
 A challenge for us to reach out, to be vulnerable, to make space in our homes for those who need

132
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,120
 to experience family this Christmas.

133
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,400
 What else can we learn from the first Christmas?

134
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,280
 What was its purpose?

135
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,640
 What was the purpose of the first Christmas?

136
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:37,520
 Jesus came into the world to make sure every human being knew their full worth, that they

137
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,400
 were loved and that they were valuable.

138
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:49,040
 What would our Christmas look like if our sole focus was to ensure that the people in

139
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:58,000
 our lives came away from Christmas fully loved, fully assured of their value?

140
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,840
 You see, the trouble is that Christmas comes with lots of traditions.

141
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,480
 I mentioned some earlier.

142
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,200
 I have fond memories from my childhood of a present opened the night before Christmas.

143
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,800
 It always contained a new set of clothes that we would wear the next day to church.

144
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,760
 We couldn't open the rest of our presents till we got home from church.

145
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,200
 We were always envious of the families who let their kids open their presents on Christmas

146
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,760
 morning.

147
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:42,560
 And once we got home, we'd have a big Christmas dinner with a Christmas ham, grandma's potato

148
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,960
 salad, and all the trimmings.

149
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,600
 We often had people at our table that were not blood related.

150
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,320
 In the early years, we often had students from Papua New Guinea that mum and dad would

151
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,720
 bring back with them to Australia.

152
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,040
 My mum and dad were teachers in Papua New Guinea, and every Christmas they would pay

153
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,320
 for some senior students to accompany them back with our family to Australia to have

154
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,880
 Christmas.

155
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,680
 And in the later years, I remember bringing loads of our friends from university back

156
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,960
 to my parents' place to share Christmas.

157
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,000
 After a big Christmas lunch, we'd play a game of backyard cricket and then get stuck

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,240
 into the leftovers, because there's always leftovers on Christmas Day.

159
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:39,680
 Here are some photos from my childhood of students that my mum and dad would bring back

160
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,720
 from Papua New Guinea to us to share Christmas with us.

161
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,640
 That's a little Susanna up there with the blonde hair.

162
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,040
 Sorry, they're so hard to see because obviously they're back in, you know, the time when cameras

163
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,840
 were not that great.

164
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:03,520
 Over the years, I've tried to recreate some of these traditions for my own children, wanting

165
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,320
 them to experience some of the joy that I remember from my childhood, and I've tried

166
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,840
 to recreate some of the joy that I remember from my childhood.

167
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,760
 And there's nothing inherently wrong with this.

168
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,880
 But recently, God got my attention and shared something with me that I'd like to share

169
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,840
 with you today.

170
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:27,040
 A month ago, I was at Bethany on Chungchow Island, having a retreat.

171
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,520
 If you don't know what Bethany is, it's a retreat centre on Chungchow Island, very

172
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,320
 cheap, but a beautiful place that you can go if you just want to stop.

173
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,720
 You can either take your family or go as an individual.

174
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,120
 I highly recommend it.

175
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,760
 And when I go there, there's a place I go to sit in the morning.

176
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 It's out on the rocks on a cliff overlooking the water.

177
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,480
 Every time I go to Bethany, I visit this same spot and have a quiet time.

178
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,960
 It's become a bit of a tradition.

179
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,880
 Well, this time when I got there, it began to rain.

180
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,320
 At first, it was a light shower, and then it became a downpour.

181
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,360
 I didn't want to leave.

182
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
 This was my tradition.

183
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,360
 So I began searching for a dry place.

184
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,800
 I eventually found one tucked under some trees.

185
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,120
 However, as I was sitting there, I realised I could see none of the views, none of the

186
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,080
 beautiful views that I loved going to that place for.

187
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
 So I began searching again.

188
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,600
 And after 10 minutes, I stopped and I said, "God, you knew I was going to be here.

189
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,840
 You prompted me to come.

190
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,120
 What are you trying to tell me?"

191
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:51,440
 And I felt God say to me, "You can continue to waste time trying to recapture an experience

192
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,080
 you've had in the past, or you can embrace the reality of this moment, this new moment

193
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,840
 in time, and create a new experience, a new memory."

194
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:12,160
 You see, when we try to recapture an experience or memory from the past, you might create

195
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,480
 a version of it, like sitting in the dry space under the tree.

196
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
 But you'll miss out on the views.

197
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,200
 You'll miss out on the beauty of the new things you could have experienced.

198
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,720
 At that first Christmas, Joseph's family were trying to hold on to their reputation,

199
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,240
 their traditions.

200
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,240
 But the reality was that life had changed.

201
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,640
 Circumstances had changed.

202
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,840
 Joseph and Mary's life had changed.

203
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,480
 Yes, it was messy, but they were family.

204
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:56,960
 Instead of embracing this, Joseph's family chose to try and keep up the appearance of

205
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,760
 the perfect family by distancing themselves from the mess.

206
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:12,800
 So let me ask again, what would our Christmas look like if our sole focus was to ensure

207
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:21,040
 that the people in our lives came away from Christmas fully loved and fully assured of

208
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,760
 their value?

209
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,320
 Would it look a little more messy?

210
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,080
 Would there be more people at our table?

211
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:38,160
 Would there be moments of tears as we held someone who might be experiencing their first

212
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,480
 Christmas without their spouse or their friend or their grandparent or their child?

213
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:52,400
 If we relinquished our preconceptions of what Christmas should be and instead made it a

214
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:02,880
 time of welcome, a time of inclusion where rejection is undone and loss is acknowledged,

215
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:12,960
 a time of deep love, a time where we reaffirm value despite the chaos and despite the mess,

216
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:22,640
 maybe, just maybe, we will see wondrous new views and unexpected beauty in the midst of

217
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,120
 the mess.

218
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,600
 Something like what the wise men experienced.

219
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:39,360
 In the middle of all the mess of Herod and his scheming, the wise men go on their way

220
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,040
 and the star they'd seen in the east goes ahead of them and it stops over the place

221
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,080
 where the child is.

222
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:54,400
 When they saw the star, they're overjoyed and on coming inside, they see the child with

223
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,760
 his mother Mary and they bow and worship him.

224
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,240
 They open their treasures and they present him with gifts.

225
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,760
 The wise men got to see this wondrous new view, the brand new baby born in the midst

226
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
 of the chaos of that time.

227
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,080
 Upholding the traditions of Christmas, the food, the presents, the decorations, it can

228
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,880
 be stressful.

229
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,720
 I'm a little bit stressed at the moment because my four grown children have all their

230
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,920
 presents wrapped under the tree and I don't have one.

231
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,400
 Very stressful.

232
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,400
 The first Christmas came with some gifts but in every other way, it was very ordinary.

233
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,720
 Why did God bring his son into the world this way?

234
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,440
 Almost in the poorest, humblest way.

235
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,680
 Why?

236
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,360
 When he could have arranged it so differently?

237
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,640
 I think there are two main reasons.

238
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,280
 I think he wanted to identify with his creation, with us.

239
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
 With the least.

240
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,600
 To tell us this Christmas that he understands what it is to be without.

241
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,280
 He understands what it is to be estranged from family.

242
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,760
 To be lonely and in need.

243
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,960
 He understands what it is to feel rejected, to feel unseen.

244
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,560
 And to be labelled invaluable by society.

245
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:50,640
 In our mess, our chaos, our confusion, our disappointment, our loneliness, our exclusion,

246
00:20:50,640 --> 00:21:00,000
 our rejection, Jesus can look us straight in the eye and he can say, "I fully understand.

247
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,640
 I've been there."

248
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,480
 Another reason I believe God chose to bring his son into the world in this way is to loudly

249
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:17,520
 proclaim that he would not be all about the bells and the whistles, all the external trappings

250
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,480
 of wealth and position and privilege and pride.

251
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,680
 He would not be like any earthly king.

252
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,440
 His kingdom would not focus on the outward.

253
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,480
 But the inward.

254
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,720
 Can we be reminded this Christmas that it is not about the bells and whistles?

255
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,280
 Can we lay aside any stress that is building?

256
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,920
 Can we lay aside any strivings for the perfect Christmas?

257
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,760
 Can we learn from Jesus what Christmas is truly all about?

258
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,880
 Christmas can be simple.

259
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,880
 And Christmas can be messy.

260
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,600
 Christmas can be different from what it has been before.

261
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,240
 This Christmas, can we be challenged to embrace the new moment we are in?

262
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,120
 Can we be challenged to create some new views?

263
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,640
 Can we open up our family home to those who need it the most?

264
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:35,760
 Can we be challenged to reconcile and invite family members back in who've previously been

265
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,320
 shut out?

266
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:46,160
 Instead of lavishing expensive gifts on people, can we give them the gift of our time,

267
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,240
 our presence, our love?

268
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,040
 Can we make sure that the least in our worlds are remembered?

269
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,880
 That they're visited, that they're given gifts?

270
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,200
 I want you to stop and think, who are the people in your life,

271
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,680
 who are the least that God has surrounded your life with?

272
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,360
 Are they domestic workers?

273
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,040
 Are they elderly relatives?

274
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,240
 Are they refugee families?

275
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
 Are they people who have no one to spend Christmas with?

276
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,640
 There's a lot of people in Hong Kong who have no family here to spend Christmas with.

277
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,880
 And in fact, when we came to Hong Kong, we were very lonely.

278
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:43,040
 And when it came to Christmas time, we decided that we would open up our Christmas table to

279
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,120
 anyone who didn't have a place to go.

280
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,800
 And we forged some of the most beautiful relationships from those times.

281
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,120
 Some of the people we've shared Christmas with are in the services today.

282
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,120
 Some of them will be joining us on Christmas Day still.

283
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:13,840
 If in our loneliness we had not reached out, if we'd not been vulnerable, we would have

284
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:24,080
 missed out on all those beautiful new views, all those beautiful friends that we now have,

285
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,120
 that we've made family.

286
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:35,200
 Jesus' purpose in coming was to make sure every human knows their full worth, that they

287
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,640
 are fully loved and fully valuable.

288
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,840
 Can this become our purpose this Christmas?

289
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,880
 Can you stand with me?

290
00:24:46,880 --> 00:25:01,600
 Father, we just come to you.

291
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:11,840
 And in the midst of all this crowd, each of us is seen by you.

292
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:20,560
 Because you don't see a crowd, God, you see individuals that you love, that you know,

293
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,640
 that you value.

294
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:31,840
 Father, we just ask that this Christmas we will take the opportunity to reimagine it.

295
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
 See what it could be.

296
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,200
 Ask you if there's something new that you want us to do with it.

297
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,560
 Someone you want us to draw near.

298
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,080
 Someone you want us to love better.

299
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,560
 Someone you want us to reconcile with and to give a second chance to.

300
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:06,880
 Father, we just remember in this moment how loved we are.

301
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:17,920
 Wrap us up afresh in your kindness and your love.

302
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,680
 And Father, this Christmas,

303
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,800
 may it be a little bit messy.

304
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:39,200
 May we be willing to open up ourselves to share it with a few more people.

305
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 To share it with someone maybe who's grieving.

306
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,520
 And Father, I also pray for people standing here today.

307
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 And no one's ever told you that you were composed with all the beautiful notes.

308
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,880
 You've never heard that you are so loved.

309
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,120
 That God didn't even withhold his own son.

310
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,800
 He wanted you to know that you are fully valuable.

311
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,000
 Fully treasured.

312
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,120
 And if you don't know that today, then I encourage you

313
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,120
 to pray with someone, to let someone know.

314
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:39,120
 Because you are loved with a love that has no end to it.

315
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,320
 Father, for those of us who've been blessed with much,

316
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:58,400
 show us ways to make the least be seen this Christmas.

317
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:07,440
 That they might know that they are known and that you see them.

318
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:15,760
 [Music]

319
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,600
 Father, we just thank you for the example that you gave us of that first Christmas.

320
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,760
 You didn't make it something that was so out of reach that none of us could reach it.

321
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,800
 You made it something so simple.

322
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,600
 Just relationships.

323
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,440
 [Music]

324
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,040
 No material things.

325
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,640
 We can all do that, God.

326
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,400
 Just great love.

327
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,520
 Fill us all afresh with your great love.

328
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,680
 Your capacity that goes beyond offences.

329
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,120
 That goes beyond estrangement.

330
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,920
 That goes beyond our limits.

331
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,440
 And makes a way where there is no way.

332
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,800
 This Christmas, God.

333
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:15,120
 May the people in our lives leave Christmas fully assured of that they are loved.

334
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,720
 Fully assured that they are valued and that they are known.

335
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,640
 In your precious name.

336
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,480
 Amen.
