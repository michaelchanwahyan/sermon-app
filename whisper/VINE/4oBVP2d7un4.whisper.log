[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   As always, good and honored to be here with everybody to bring God's Word.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I'm a Hong Kong boy and grew up here in Hong Kong.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   How many of you guys grew up here in Hong Kong?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Did you get a wave of hands?
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Okay, a lot of us. Really cool.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Okay, so I think you can agree, a really fun and exciting place to grow up as a kid.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   One of my favorite pastimes, maybe you resonate with this too,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   was to go to the video games arcades that used to be everywhere, right?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Go to the arcade and play video games. That was one of my favorite things to do back in the day.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Before home consoles were popular, before we had mobile phones with all kinds of games on them,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   the arcade was the place to hang out.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   If you wanted to play video games, you wanted to spend time with your friends,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   you would go to the arcades.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And they would be everywhere. There used to be so many arcades.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Street Fighter, Final Fight, Initial D, Dance Dance Revolution.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   You looked like an idiot trying to step on all those arrows. It was so much fun.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Beatmania, you could be like a DJ and make music and stuff like that.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   So much fun.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   After school, you take your lunch money. You're supposed to buy lunch with it, but you didn't.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   So you go to the arcade, you go up to the counter, you change your money for the one dollar coins,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and that was your afternoon sorted.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   The best extracurricular activity you could do.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   However, there was a problem.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Because these arcades actually had an age requirement.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And so technically, you had to be 16 years old to go in and play these games.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So let's travel back in time. Imagine it's 1996.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   12-year-old Alison, just into secondary school.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I'm like 4'5" at the time, trying to pass as a 16-year-old.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   You can judge for yourself. This is a picture of me at 12 years old.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   I look about 9, probably.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I know it's paid off now. I still look young.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Asians don't raise in, that's what they say.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   But back then, it was ultra frustrating.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Because I would walk into the arcade, and the manager would take one look at me and say,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   "There is no way this little boy is 16 years old. You need to get out."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So desperately, I tried to make myself look older.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I would put on glasses, put on spectacles to make myself look more mature.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   That never worked. Put on certain clothes to make myself look older.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   That never worked. Or a walk-in weary confident.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Never worked, until I found one way around this.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I discovered fake IDs.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Now, I'm not proud of this, but desperate times call for stupid decisions.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So I thought if I had a fake ID, it wouldn't matter how I looked.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I could just show the ID, and I would be playing games all through my afternoon.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The more idiotic part of this plan, I had no idea how to get a fake ID.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   My dad's a policeman, so it was a really big problem for me.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So, I decided to make it myself.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I had it, so I wish I could show you a picture of it.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   It was red with lightning bolts in the background.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I used Microsoft Word. Amazing Word art, graphics, all that kind of stuff.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I became Jarvis Lee, 16 years old, attending Washington Heights International School.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It was just completely made up. I thought it was legit, like laminated and everything.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   To my surprise, it would sometimes work.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Only if the lady behind the arcade manager was an old Chinese lady who didn't read any English.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That was the only situation it would work.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   As I was reflecting on my childhood and reflecting on this passage,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   some of these things made me think about some questions that I had.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So often in life, we judge things. We have to judge things.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   We often judge things based upon the way it looks.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Often, this leads to us having a fear of other people's judgment.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Because of other people's judgment, what we think they might think about us,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   we want to change the way we are.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Or maybe I'll ask it this way. Have you ever wished you could be, or you were,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   or you look like someone else because of what other people's expectations of you were?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   We were in week two of our sermon series, and we're starting 2025 Strong Together.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   We're looking at these passages in the book of 1 Samuel.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   We're discovering, we want to see how we can begin well.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   We're shifting our focus from intimacy last year into action.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And we recall, you know, last year, Andrew talked about us not letting the things of the past, right,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   these emotional barriers of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure hold us back
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   because these things often stop us from moving forward to where God wants us to go.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And so today I want to talk to us about our choices.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And this is an important step to take because we've moved, right,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   we've been moved and motivated into action, right?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's the whole point. Together as a body of Christ, we hear God calling us into action.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But in order to act well, we have to choose well.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   But this is the issue, right?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We very much make choices based on outward appearances, right,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   from like fruit at the wet market to the people we meet every day.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   We are constantly making judgments based upon the way things look
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and then based upon our judgment of them, we'll make certain choices.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   There's academic studies done about this, right?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   We'll tell you that no matter how much we embrace, you know,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   the mantra of don't judge a book by its cover,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   the truth is we go about our daily lives responding to a lot of people based upon their physical appearance.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And the sad truth is that if you're deemed to be more attractive,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   you're often treated more favorably or so I've been told.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I don't know. Maybe you can ask Nathan. Is that true?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Yeah. Yeah. Going around as a handsome man.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   We can look at the passage today. Right.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And as we continue tracing Samuel's journey,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   my prayers that it would challenge us to shift our perspective, right,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   to open up our eyes to the fact that if we are truly to follow God with our lives,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   we have to see things from his perspective and we must learn to embrace the things that he values
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   so we can live the lives and make the choices that God wants us to make.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Because at the end of the day, that is our goal, right?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   As followers of Jesus, that is where we find our significance.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   That's where we find our meaning in lives.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   That's where we want to put our efforts into beginning and acting,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   not with our agenda, but with God's heart for us.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And true significance, true action is going to come when you discover and embrace God's direction for you.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So we're going to go to scripture 1 Samuel 16, 2 to 13.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   And we're going to pick up from where Andrew left off last week.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'm going to read. It's a longish passage. So bear with me.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   You can read together and let's see what God says.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   But Samuel said, how can I go if? Yeah, sorry. Let me start again.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   But Samuel said, how can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   The Lord said, take a heifer with you and say, I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show you what to do.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Samuel did what the Lord said when he arrived at Bethlehem.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   The elders of the town trembled when they met him.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   They asked, do you come in peace?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Samuel said, yes, in peace, I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   surely the Lord's anointed stands here before the Lord.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   But the Lord said to Samuel, listen, do not consider his appearance or his sight,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   for I have rejected him.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   The Lord does not look at the things people look at.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Then Jesse called Adimadab and had him pass in front of Samuel.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   But Samuel said, the Lord has not chosen this one either.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   nor has the Lord chosen this one.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   but Samuel said to him, the Lord has not chosen these.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   So he asked Jesse, are these all the sons that you have?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   They are still the youngest, Jesse answered.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   He is tending the sheep.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Samuel said, send for him.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   We will not sit down until he arrives.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So he sent for him and had him brought in.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Then the Lord said, rise and anoint him.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   This is the one.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   So Samuel took the horn of oil, as he did last we remember with Saul,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and anointed him in the presence of his brothers.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   And from that day on, the spirit of the Lord had come powerfully upon David.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Samuel then went on to Ramah.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So a quick story of a recap of the story so far.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Israel had the first case of what it's like to have a king rule over them.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And with Saul as a king, what started off as a good thing has very quickly turned sour,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   just as God had warned them that it would.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And ultimately, Saul disobeys God.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   He makes some really, really silly, really bad choices.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And as a consequence, he is rejected as the king of Israel.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   But I think to get an even fuller picture of what's happening,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   we need to go even further back.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Because the whole reason that Israelites wanted a king in the first place
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   was because they too had made a pretty bad choice.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   A new nation, a new group of people emerging out of slavery into the Promised Land.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   They'd been wandering in the wilderness.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   They looked around them and they saw that every single other country,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   all the other people around them had a physical king,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   an actual dude that they could look to, a person they could see to lead them.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And so they started to think, well, we actually, we want to be just like them.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   In fact, the very words of the people were, we want a king over us.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Then we will be like all the other nations with a king to lead us,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   to go up before us and to fight our battles.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Andrew, we mentioned this last week a little bit as well,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   but I want to revisit it because this baffles me every time I read it.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   You know, just to think, after all that God had brought them through
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   out of slavery, right into the wilderness, looking after them with food,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   miraculously like manna and quail and water gushing from the rock, right?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Parting the Red Sea, bringing down the walls of Jericho,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   countless miraculous victories over the enemies.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Time after time after time, God proving his faithfulness to them.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And time and time again, God proving to them that he is the greatest,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   the strongest, more powerful than any human king or any other God could ever be.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And yet Israel said they would rather have a human king rule over them other than God.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   They had forgotten their role as the chosen people,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   as the ones who'd been set apart by God.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I mean, just think, if Samuel felt rejected, how do you think God felt in that moment?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   The Israelites made a terrible choice because they forgot their first love.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   They forgot who it was that had given them everything they had,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   and instead they wanted to conform and become like everyone else.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   But how about us, church?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   When we look back at our own lives, you know, and as we point through
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and as we recall all the things God has guided us through,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   maybe some of us in this room were once enslaved to sin,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   but God has set you free from that.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Maybe once we were in a season of wilderness, wondering where to go.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Now God has led us to a promised land.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Maybe God has helped you overcome and defeat enemies that you thought would destroy you.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   But now that things are good, perhaps we've been looking around and thinking to ourselves,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   actually, you know, maybe there actually is a better way.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And lots of people around me don't follow God.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Lots of people around me aren't about Jesus.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Maybe it would be better to be like everyone else.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It seems like sometimes when we look at people and the way they live their lives,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   you don't know God, they have more freedom.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   They can just do whatever they want to do.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Maybe that's the way to live.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Or maybe you're suddenly feeling a bit self-conscious about your relationship with Jesus.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And because it's a bit different, you know, you're starting to feel a bit weird
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   and feel like you stand out a little bit.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And so you try to fit in and you want to conform and look like everyone else
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   rather than representing Jesus with how you live your life.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And I feel like as we do this, if we make these sort of choices,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   God's heart is grieved when he sees his children walk away from him in this way.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Let me be a reminder for us this morning.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   I'm preaching to myself as well, church, okay?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Stay faithful to God.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   There is no other way.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   The best choice you can make in your life is to keep being obedient to Jesus.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Now, this might be the best choice.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   But as we've probably discovered, it's not going to be easy.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   And I think there's one big barrier that holds us back from starting off this journey,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   from making this choice to being obedient to Jesus, holding us back from faithfulness.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   And this is the fear, the question of what if.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   It's the fear of what if that actually initially holds Samuel back
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   when God tells him to go and anoint one of Jesse's sons to be the new king of Israel.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Listen to it again.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   He says, "How can I go if?"
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   What if?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   "If Saul hears about it, he will kill me."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   "If Saul hears about it, he will kill me."
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And you know what?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   He had some legitimate grounds for his fears.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Saul had just been told, and the Bible tells us he had just been removed as king,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   so he's very conscious of what's happening with his role.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   He's angry.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   He's emotional.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   He's the kind of guy that's very capable of taking someone's life.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Actually, the whole nation is afraid.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   When Samuel comes to the elders of the village, they say even they're trembling about what's going to happen next.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And we can apply this to our own lives too.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   But when God charges us with something, when God tells you to do something,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   maybe it's something a bit challenging, maybe it's something a bit tough,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   maybe it's going to take a little bit of courage, a little bit of a risk.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   But how do we respond?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I know often in life, my own answer to this starts with a "what if."
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I'm not sure, you know, under church, if you relate to that.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I wonder how many of us are stuck in this "what if,"
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   and I wonder how many of these "what ifs" hold us back from what God really wants to do through us.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I wonder how many of us are letting our "what ifs" stop us making the right choice to be obedient to God.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Because listen, if we focus on "what ifs," the list could go on forever.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   There is always going to be the question of "what if" whenever God asks us to do something.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   This is what Moses struggled with when God told him to go back into Israel, to free your people, let the people go.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   "What if" was one of the first things Moses responded.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   "What if they don't believe me? What if the Pharaoh, you know, I'm not a good speaker.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   What if? What if? What if?"
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   "What if I never find anyone else ever again? What if I fail?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   What if people make fun of me? What if I get rejected? What if it doesn't work out?"
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   These echo the five emotional barriers that Andrew talked about last week.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   The hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure all can be rooted in the "what ifs."
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And if we just focus on "what ifs," it will spiral us down into a deep, dark pit
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   that's very, very difficult to climb out of.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I know in my own life, one of the biggest "what ifs" came when we were deciding to start a family and have children.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Let me explain a little bit what I mean by that.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   When I was born, I was born with a genetic condition.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It was an unexpected thing, and no one else in my family has it.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   It's one of these things that progresses over time.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It progressively can get worse. It's actually very unusual.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   You never really know how it's going to turn out, but it does progress over time as you get older.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And one of the things is that it's a 50/50 chance whether or not you pass it down to your kids.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And so as we were deciding about having kids, you know, we were fostering, do we adopt, do we have our own biological children?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   "What if?" was a huge question.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And we asked ourselves, I asked myself, "What if our kids inherit my disorder?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   What's life going to look like for them?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   What if they have to suffer through all the turmoil, the emotions, everything that I had to go through?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The last thing I would want them to go through is what I went through myself.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   What if it affects them in ways that we can't even see coming right now?"
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Now, just to be real, my wife and I, we have two children, two boys,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   and both our boys have indeed ended up inheriting my genetic condition.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   In other words, my, our, what if became a reality.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Like the thing I feared most became a reality in our lives.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   But you know what we came to realize in this process?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   What we realized in this process is that, and what I, as I was looking at this passage and reflecting,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   is that our God isn't a God of what ifs.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Our God is a God of even if. Amen?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And as Brittany and I reflected back on this journey, she was really the one who reminded me that,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   actually, God never promised that everything would be okay.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   God never promised that our boys would be born without this genetic disorder.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Even though that's what we fasted and prayed for, this is, we would gather people around,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   and we prayed, and we prayed, and we prayed.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And Brittany reminded me that we realized that the only promise that God gave
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   was that He would be with us even if.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   And what we have now is beautiful, and it's exhausting,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   but my family is a choice that I would make over and over and over and over again.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Now, just to keep it real with you too, do I still hope and pray things could be different?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Yes. Are we constantly praying for healing over myself and my sons?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Of course. Every single night, that's my prayer for them.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   But even if, even if God doesn't answer those prayers,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I'm going to give thanks for the beautiful gift that He has given us in our family and in our children.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Listen, church, don't let your what ifs hold you back.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   This is what Daniel and his friends were facing in the fiery furnace, right?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And they decided that even if they were going to be burned alive, they would stay faithful to God.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I have no clue what you guys are going through.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   You know, I've sat and been with you and sat with you through some of us in this room today.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   And I know some of us here are going through unimaginable things right now.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   But what I do know is this, even if the worst case scenario in your mind comes true,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   even if then God is with you and if we are faithful and obedient to God,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   He assures that He will never leave us or forsake us.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And this is what Samuel does, right? He, he, he responds in obedience,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   even if he had the potential for him to be, to end up dead.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Scripture tells us Samuel did what the Lord said.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Church, will this be our response?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Even if it's the hard thing to do, are we willing to do what the Lord says?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Because if we're going to embrace this year as a year of action,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   it means that the Lord is going to call us to do something.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And more often than not, it's going to be challenging, right?
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   The things that God calls us to do are not going to make sense from a worldly perspective.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   It's going to take an even if mindset for us to go forward in these things, right?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   What if Jesus tells you to give your money away to this or to that?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Would you be willing to do it?
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   What if the Holy Spirit impresses on you that you need to forgive that person
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   who has hurt you so profoundly? Would you be willing?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   What if God says you need to go and share the gospel with that colleague
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   that you've been sitting next to for three years that, you know,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   you've never talked to about Jesus. Would you be willing to do it?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Samuel's about to discover that God does things in his own and amazing ways.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And he obeys God and God sends him to Jesse's house because he has a task
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   to anoint one of his sons as the next king of Israel.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And so Samuel arrives. Let's go back to the story.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   "Surely the Lord's anointed here stands before the Lord."
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   But let me remind us again.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   "The Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not consider his appearance or his height,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   for I have rejected him.' The Lord does not look at the things people look at.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Then Jesse called Edim-ed-dab and had him pass in front of Samuel.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And Samuel said, 'The Lord has not chosen any of these sons.'"
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   The Lord didn't choose any of his seven sons.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And Jesse asked, "Are these all the sons that you have?"
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   So in my mind when I read this passage, it was like a scene out of America's Next Top Model.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Two beautiful models stand before me, but only one can become America's Next Top Model.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I do a pretty good Tyra Banks impression.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Anyway, that's for another time.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   So big brother Eliab stands up. He is tall. He is handsome. He's the man.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   This is the very reason Samuel thought Eliab was the man,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   because Saul had very similar features, we find out.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Saul was also tall and handsome.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   1 Samuel 9 tells us that Saul was tall and handsome, a handsome young man,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   as tall, a head above everybody else.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   And Samuel is so impressed by what he sees in this beautiful specimen of a person.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   And he says, "Surely, surely this has got to be it."
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   This is what I'm looking at. He's so handsome. He's so tall. He's so beautiful.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It couldn't possibly be anyone else.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   But God had other plans.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And maybe this has been you, right? Maybe you've seen something and it looks good, right?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   It makes you feel good. It's attractive. It's desirable.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   And because it looks so good, you've come to the decision that surely this is what God wants for me.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Oh, this relationship, it feels so good.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Surely this is the right person for me.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   This boy I met is so handsome. He has to be it.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   This girl I met is so pretty. Surely she's the one for me.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   This job, it pays so well. I get to work in Central, right?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   This must be the right place for me to do my work.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Listen, just because it looks good doesn't mean it is good.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And there are so many things that look good and we think will be good for us,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   but it is not what God wants for our lives.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   My son Isaiah could eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, ice cream, every single meal,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   but obviously that's not good for him.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And God challenged Samuel, "Change your perspective.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Don't look at the things other people look at.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   For a short guy like me, that's music to my ears."
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Always overlooked because of being short.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   But listen seriously how God speaks.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   This is strong language. Do not consider.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   In other words, God says, "Don't even think about it.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Don't let what you can see with your eyes make your decision for you."
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   He might be big. He might be tall. He might be handsome.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   In the world's opinion, he looks the part.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   He might look exactly what you have in mind as a king, but he is not the one.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And God goes far to say that actually he has rejected Eliab as king.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   This is the same word he uses when he removes Saul from his power position as king.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   He uses the same word. He is rejected.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   "I have rejected this man as the king of Israel."
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   In other words, what God is trying to get Samuel to know is that despite how he looks,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   despite your own judgment, like I said, he's not the man. Why?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Because the Lord does not look at the things people look at,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   and we should give a hallelujah to that.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   But let's think about this for a moment.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   What is it that we find so important?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   What are some of the things that we look at?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   What are some of these outward appearance things that we put so much weight and importance upon?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Again, don't hear me wrong.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I'm not saying don't take care of yourself, right?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Of course, keep fit, work out, put some makeup on, choose a nice outfit, get a haircut.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   All this stuff is not bad in and of itself, right?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   However, it becomes bad when we only use these earthly things and this earthly perspective
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   to make judgments about other people and how we make our decisions.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   A problem is it becomes bad when we only use these things to judge how we make our choices.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   But so often this is how society and maybe even us, we live our lives.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   We talked about this a little bit just now, but very much we live in a day and age
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   when we totally judge things based upon outward appearances.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   The things people look at, right?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Like how you look, of course, the car you drive, the watch that you're wearing, the job you hold,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   where you live, how much money you appear to have, the partner you're with,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   the places you go eat, the places you go on holiday, how much money you have,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   how much money you spend on your handbag, your education level, things like this.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   But even the more important things are things like ethnicity, the color of your skin.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   We as a people are so prone to make judgments based on these outward appearance things.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Hong Kong as a society is systemic for this, right?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   The problem is it leads to us making really, really horrible choices when we live like this.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Firstly, it affects the way we treat each other.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   We see an important-looking guy, we see a rich-looking person and a poor-looking person,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   and we begin to treat the rich-looking person better.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   We see a person who appears to be less educated or less successful,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   and we immediately make certain assumptions about them.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   We see someone of a different ethnicity or skin color,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   and immediately our mind is filled with prejudice and racist and discriminatory thoughts.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   So it affects the way we treat each other.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   But it also affects the way you treat yourself.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And often we will go to painstaking lengths to appear a certain way,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   to try and impress other people.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Maybe you're trying to force your body to make a certain way,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   causing harm to your personal health.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Maybe you're going deep into debt, you're buying all this stuff and going on holidays,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   eating all these fancy things just to give the impression that your life is good and perfect.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   And we compromise our dignity and values in relationships just so that we can feel and be accepted.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   But listen to what Scripture tells us, Church.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   "Charm is deceitful, beauty is vain."
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And don't forget that even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   In other words, even the most evil things sometimes can have the appearance of looking good.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   And you know, actually, it's easy to make yourself look good,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   to keep up an appearance, to make your social media look like your life is perfect.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   But it's all just a facade.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And this is exactly the things that frustrated when Jesus looked out at the world,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   when Jesus was here, he saw the Pharisees, right?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   One of the most frustrating things about them was that Jesus said they were like whitewashed tombs,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   good on the outside but rotten on the inside.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   You justify yourself in front of others, but God knows your heart.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Outwardly, you appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   This isn't the people we've been called to be church.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   We haven't been called to be people that just look good on the outside.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   We haven't been called to a people that make choices based upon outward appearances.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Well, let me say it this way, Jesus didn't die on the cross just so that we could appear to be good, right?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And one of the dangers we face at the beginning of the year is that we focus all our energy into making choices
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   so we can appear to be good on the outside and as long as I appear to be good, everything is going to be fine.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   But come on, do we really want to live like this?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   It's kind of easy, but it's also super exhausting.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   And you're going to fool some people for some time, maybe even for yourself for a while.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   But again, let's be reminded, God, the Lord does not look at the things people look at.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   People look at outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   The Lord is after our heart.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   He sees our motivations. He knows your intentions.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   He sees others. He sees things others don't see, right?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Your character, your values, the places we've been, the thoughts you hold in your mind, your desires, your hopes and your dreams.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   The psalmist will even say he knows when you rise up and he knows when you sit down.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   He knows everything about you because he created you.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   He is your heavenly father. There is no hiding.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   There is nothing that goes unnoticed when it comes to God's knowledge of us.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And that includes what happens inside your heart.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   So the question for us this morning, church, is this.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   How is your heart?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Is it clean?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Is it pure?
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Is it set on the things that are above and not on the things of earth?
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Do you have a heart of flesh instead of a heart of stone?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Does your heart meditate on the word of God?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Is it full of the joy of the Lord?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Is it wise?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Do you have a heart that seeks to please the Lord?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Does it come alive at the hearing of God's word?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   You have a heart that God would be after.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   These are the things that we should be concerned with most.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Things of the heart.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And yes, this is the harder choice to make.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   But when we take a good look at our hearts and squeeze it and test it,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   is it the things of God that comes out?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Because this is the kind of church that Jesus is looking for.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   This is what he went to the cross for.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Not superficial change, but for hearts that are longing for his presence in their lives.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   You see, the world might overlook the importance of the heart.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   We see that Samuel and Jesse almost did.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And these seven sons come before them, and all of them probably are tall and handsome,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   but none of them are the one that God has chosen.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   It's kind of funny in this story because he goes saying, you know,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   you have only seven boys, only seven sons.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   You have any more?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Like that seven is not enough, right?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Now, Jesse was probably thinking, it must be one of these, right?
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   It can't possibly be David.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   He didn't even bother calling David in in the first place until he was reminded,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   oh, yeah, I have one more son.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   He is out tending the sheep.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   And so from out in the fields, away from everyone, David is called in.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   He's the youngest, Jesse answered.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   He is tending the sheep.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So he's sent for, he's brought in, he's glowing with health.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   It says he has fine and handsome features.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   And the Lord said, rise up and anoint him.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   This is the one.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   So Samuel takes a horn of oil and anoints him in the presence of his brothers.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   They were still the youngest.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   This is also translated as the smallest, right?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And I think this, for Samuel, this was like a turning point.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Ah, okay.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   This is what the Lord's been saying.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   He's been telling me, don't look at this height.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Here comes this little guy now.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Okay.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   Maybe he's the one.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   And into the story introduced to David, the shepherd boy,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   glowing, healthy, and handsome, it says.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Now, again, let me explain for a minute, because it sounds a bit contradictory, right?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   God just said, don't consider his outward appearance.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Now scripture divides and describes David as fine and handsome.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Okay.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   So what's up with that?
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Okay.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   It's important, right?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Because notice, David was not picked because of his looks.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Okay.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   It just so happened, all right, that he was good looking.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It's the same point that scripture is trying to highlight, right?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   It doesn't matter how you look.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   If you're handsome, congratulations.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   God can use you.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Okay.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   If you look a bit different, okay, God can choose you too.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   The same point remains, right?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   The looks is not what God looks on as important.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   What matters is your heart.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And we're going to find out the qualities that David had were beyond his handsome
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   and rugged looks, right?
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   It's because he had a heart that was after God, right?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   He was a man after God's own heart.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And the fact that he was a shepherd boy is also a significant detail.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Again, on the outward appearance, something others would have overlooked, right?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Being a shepherd would not have made sense for him to become king, right?
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Someone with -- you needed someone, right, for a king to be from a military
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   background, right, who knew how to fight, right?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Who is this kid who's been tending sheep, right?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   What right does he have to become a king?
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Right, David is almost like a male Cinderella in this story, right?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Cast out to the field to do the domestic chores.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   But as we consider further on in the story, when Jesus comes to this earth,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   how else does he describe himself as the good shepherd, right?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   As pastors, right, the word pastor actually means a shepherd of the people, right?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   So it's ironic that as the people would have never chosen a shepherd boy to lead the nation,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   this is exactly what God had in mind all along.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   It looks like he doesn't know how to fight, but check this out.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   You'll find out next week.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   It was very much because he was a shepherd out in the fields protecting his sheep
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   that David acquired the skills that he needed to fight and bring down Goliath
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   when he was in one-on-one combat with him.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   My point is this, God is serious when he says he looks at the heart.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   God isn't concerned about outward appearances and social norms.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   So church, let me ask you again, how is your heart?
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Because it might seem like according to the world, you don't have what it takes.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And people might have said to you, "Oh, you haven't achieved very much.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   What do you have to show for yourself?"
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   It might seem like from outward appearances and earthly standards
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   that you haven't been successful.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Don't let the world lie to you.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Stop listening to that junk and open your eyes to see things from God's perspective.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Are we as a body of Christ able to rise above these superficial and earthly standards?
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   The call on us, like I said, has not been to conform to this world,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   but to allow the Holy Spirit of God to transform and renew us.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   And this starts by the renewing of our hearts.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   The Psalms will teach us to pray, "Create in me a pure heart, O God,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   and renew a steadfast spirit within me."
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Create in me a pure heart, not so I can look good to everyone else,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   not so I can appear to be righteous,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   but create within me a pure heart so that empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I'm able to do your will.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I'm able to choose to live life in the way that God has called me to live.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I don't care what the world thinks.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   I don't care about that stuff.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   If this is really going to be a year of action for us,
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   if we're serious about seeing the life of the Holy Spirit move in this church,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   if we're serious to see people coming into life-changing,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   salvation-giving relationship with Jesus,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   then this needs to be a place where all of us,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   I'm calling all of us to reflect the heart of God.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   This needs to be a place where someone who doesn't know Jesus at all
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   walks in and says, "You know what? These people are different.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I'm not judged here as I am on the outside world.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They don't live life the same way.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   They don't make decisions the same way.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   They have hearts that reflect the heart of Jesus."
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   And if we want to see the Spirit of God move powerfully in our midst,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   our hearts have to be in the right place.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   So this is how we're going to end.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   I'm going to ask all of us to close our eyes
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   so we can just focus on what God wants to speak to us in this time.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   So I encourage you, church,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   and if you're online and overflow outside right now,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   just close your eyes so you can focus.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   And our prayer is going to come from the line in the psalm that I read just now.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   I'm going to invite you in a minute to pray and repeat after me.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   I'm repeating Scripture, but you repeat after God's Word.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   But only do so if you're ready, church.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Only do so if this is something that--a choice that you're making for yourself.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   So I'm going to read.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And like I said, if you feel ready, you can repeat this as well.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   "Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Now let that sit with you for a minute.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And invite the Holy Spirit now to come and move in your heart,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   to do that searching, to search the depth,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   to bring up anything that you need to confess to the Lord,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   to deal with, to hand over to Him.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And just invite the Holy Spirit now to come and move within you.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   [music]
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   And as the Holy Spirit is moving,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   I again invite you to repeat these words after me from Psalm 139.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   "Search me, God, and know my heart.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Test me and know my anxious thoughts.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   See if there's any offensive way in me,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   and lead me in the way everlasting."
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   And so, Jesus, as we come before you now as a church,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   we pray for our hearts.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And I pray that you would come and do the work
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   that only your love and your presence can do.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And yes, the world might have a certain--
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   we have to be in this world, and we have to live lives,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   and we have to go about our daily work and things like that.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   But it's precisely in those spaces, Lord, that you want us to represent you.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   It's precisely in the way we live our lives
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   that you want us to reflect who you are,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   the heart that you have for us and the people around us.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   And so, Jesus, we give our hearts to you.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Give us hearts that are clean and pure and new
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   so that we can make the choices and live the life
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   that you have called us to live.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   And as your body, Lord, as your children, as this church,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   as followers of you, we carry that with us
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   every single day of our life, Lord.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Come change our hearts, Jesus.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   We pray this in your name.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   Amen.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.580]   (gentle music)
