[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   So there was this moment that happened for me
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.800]   on my recent walk of the Camino de Santiago in Spain
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.560]   that deeply reminds me of what we have just been
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.040]   singing about in that song.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.500]   The Camino is around about 800 kilometers of length.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.880]   You walk from this place called Saint John in France
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.260]   all the way to Santiago de Compostela
[00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.000]   in the west coast of Spain.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.920]   And as you walk every day, you connect to
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.880]   and walk through and past multiple Catholic churches.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.520]   In fact, on any particular given day,
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.840]   you might walk through say three to five different villages
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.340]   and every single one of those villages
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.880]   will be centered around some form of church,
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.320]   this Catholic church.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.040]   And some of those churches are incredibly beautiful,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.120]   huge, wonderful buildings, like architectural wonders.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.200]   Some of those churches are small, rural,
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.320]   almost forgotten churches where maybe inside
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.520]   there is nothing more than a couple of pews
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.360]   and a rusty old iron cross.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.600]   And I used to love when I was walking the Camino
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500]   to take every opportunity I could to connect with a church.
[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.720]   If I was walking past a church,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.360]   inevitably those churches would be open.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.440]   And most of the time, they were open and no one was in there
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.520]   and so I loved that because it meant that I could go in,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.340]   have a time of solitude, maybe take my backpack off
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.360]   for 10 minutes and just sit there and pray
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.280]   and encounter the presence of God.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.120]   These churches were like wonderful gifts of solitude
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.920]   as we walked every day.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.640]   Well, on this particular day,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.920]   I was walking into this small village
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.080]   and I noticed that there was a church
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.400]   that was off the trail.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.360]   Now, this was somewhat unusual because usually the Camino,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.700]   the official trail, takes you to the center of a village
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.480]   or the center of a town and right up to the big church
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.700]   in the center of the town.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760]   But for whatever reason, in this particular village,
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.960]   the Camino path was going straight ahead
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   and avoiding the little church that was over to the left.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.480]   And I saw it would take me maybe about five or seven minutes
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.440]   to walk over to that church and I had time
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.840]   and so I decided, okay, look, I'm gonna go off the path,
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.520]   I'm gonna go over there and I'm going to just have my time
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.100]   of solitude in this church.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.560]   So I enter into this church.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.800]   It's a small church.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.880]   It's probably got about, maybe it could seat
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.800]   maybe 50 people in total, so a small kind of church.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.360]   As I walk straight in, I'm the only person there
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.800]   or at least I thought I was, but as soon as I walk in,
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.720]   I hear this kind of like person get up from sitting down
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.760]   over on the right side and it's this old nun
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.720]   and she runs up to me with this big smile on her face
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.960]   and she's so excited that a pilgrim has entered the church.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.400]   I could tell from her face that she's been waiting
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.080]   a long time for someone to come and visit her in her church
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.920]   and she's got this big smile on her face
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.760]   and she literally runs up to me and she grabs my arms
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.880]   with her little hands and she starts speaking to me
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.600]   excitedly in Spanish.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.780]   Now, if you know me, you'll know I know nothing
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.200]   of Spanish at all, but in that moment,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.140]   I could see her enthusiasm and her joy that I had visited,
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.500]   so I didn't want to break her heart by telling her
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.260]   I didn't speak Spanish.
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.520]   So I just let her talk and as she talked,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.940]   I followed her nonverbal cues as to pretend
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.500]   that I understood her, so if she smiled,
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.720]   I would be like, oh.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.360]   If she nodded, I would be like, mm.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.720]   And I basically was trying to pretend like,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.000]   I think probably after a while,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.640]   she realized I couldn't speak Spanish,
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.000]   but anyway, she kept going and she was so enthusiastic,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.180]   so excited, she grabbed me on the arm
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.220]   and she started to walk me through her church.
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.140]   Now, again, it's not a particularly big church,
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.280]   but there were like paintings and icons all over this church
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.120]   as there often are in Catholic churches
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.960]   and so she wanted to like show me and tell me
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.800]   in incredibly detailed Spanish all about these paintings
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.080]   and the icons and so I'm polite and I'm nice
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.040]   and so I'm following her along and nodding
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.200]   at the right times and laughing at the right time.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.320]   We get about halfway around and by this time,
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.400]   we're standing at the front where the kind of nave
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.640]   of the church is and we're standing there
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.520]   and she's talking away and we hear somebody else
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.560]   enter the church and so we both kind of turn
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.520]   and sure enough, in the entrance of the church,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.560]   another pilgrim walks in.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.960]   Now, this pilgrim, you can tell he's a pilgrim
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.720]   'cause he's wearing his backpack and everything,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.880]   looks like a pilgrim, he's probably in his late 50s,
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.740]   early 60s and he comes in and he stands literally inside
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.160]   the entrance of the church and he starts to weep.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.960]   Now, this is not just like your standard
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.440]   kind of like a couple of tears, a little bit embarrassed,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.220]   sort of don't really mean to be crying here at the moment
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.220]   kind of tears, this was like a wailing kind of mourning,
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.240]   kind of gnashing of teeth, kind of very loud
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.880]   sort of sobbing that this man was doing.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.600]   The nun stares up at me and her eyes are filled
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.760]   with this beautiful picture of compassion
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.720]   and she leaves me straight away and I don't know
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.180]   if you have ever seen a nun run.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.100]   But if you ever get the chance to see a nun run,
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.040]   I highly recommend it.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.400]   She leaves me and she hitches up like the skirt
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.740]   of her habit and she runs down the center of the church
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.980]   to this man.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.160]   She runs up to him and embraces him in this big hug
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.560]   and then she gingerly and tenderly walks him
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.940]   and sits him down in one of the pews
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.720]   and she begins to pray for him.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.220]   And there is this profound moment that something
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.020]   is happening in this little church that no one
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.820]   perhaps expected and that moment of great compassion
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.260]   of hers and the running towards the one in need
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.900]   filled and stirred compassion in me.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.240]   And I remember feeling to myself like I just came in here
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.640]   to connect with Jesus but actually now is a chance
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.740]   for me to be pastoral and so I walked, I didn't run,
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.680]   I walked down the church and I came up against the man
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.280]   and I just gently placed my hand on his shoulder
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.460]   and I began to pray and the nun is praying fervently
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.380]   for him and he's loudly wailing and crying
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.500]   and I didn't know anything about this man at that moment
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.220]   but a few days later I discovered that he was
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.260]   a Portuguese man and he had been a homicide detective
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.620]   for 20 years and he was walking the Camino
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.420]   just as he is retired, he's walking the Camino
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.300]   to purge the evil that he had seen out of himself
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.360]   over 20 years.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.620]   And something happened in that moment where he walks
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.260]   into that church, the Holy Spirit meets with him
[00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.380]   and we have this profound encounter together
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.260]   and as we're standing there praying over him,
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.340]   we're praying in human languages that are mixed
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.060]   and only partially understood but we're also praying
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.660]   in a heart and emotional language that is clear
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.420]   and fully understood, perhaps more understood
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.460]   than any other language can be and that's the universal
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.160]   language of unadulterated love.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.860]   Love.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.460]   I wonder if you've ever tried to describe love
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.780]   or try to find words to explain to somebody what love is.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.100]   It's actually really hard, isn't it, to kind of use
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.180]   language to try to describe a factual or logical
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.160]   understanding of what love is but when we're swept up
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.780]   in a moment of love, when love breaks through barriers
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.460]   and begins to do what only love can do,
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.580]   well it lifts something in us as human beings, doesn't it?
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.520]   It creates something within us and it binds us together
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.020]   as humans like nothing ever can where three strangers
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.220]   who don't even speak the same language can find
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.500]   a deeper connection than in any other time.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.260]   When love breaks through, humans become just the way
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.020]   they were created to be.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.380]   It's interesting, I wonder if you've ever thought
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.380]   of love that way, that love actually makes us truly human,
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.100]   that the moments of pure love are our most natural
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.160]   and rawest moments as human beings.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.300]   There's a lot of talk right now about AI
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.820]   and about the future of AI and particularly about
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.260]   the future of humanity swept up in this kind of formation
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.100]   and forming and shaping of what humanity will look like
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.180]   in the future because of AI and I think there's a lot
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.420]   of things to be excited for with this development of AI
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.640]   as well as perhaps some things for us to be cautious about
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.540]   but here's one thing I do know, there is one thing
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.820]   that no matter how advanced AI may become,
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.180]   it will never be able to do and that is to love.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:56.700]   You see, I'm convinced that love is our unique contribution
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.020]   to the world that sets us apart as human beings
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.180]   who are made in the image of God.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.100]   Isn't that a beautiful thought?
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.980]   That love might be the one thing that sets us apart,
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.060]   that love might be the unique thing that has been placed
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.100]   inside of us to help us to contribute something
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.940]   to this incredible creation that God has made.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.220]   Could it be that love is able to do what no algorithm
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.480]   could ever predict or do?
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.220]   I've been in those moments, maybe you have too,
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.460]   where love immediately shifts a very difficult conversation,
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.540]   where love brings new hope into what was thought
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.620]   to be a lost cause, where love actually changes
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.340]   the dynamics of a relationship in a moment
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.020]   or perhaps where love actually bridges the divide
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.820]   of hatred or ignorance when we are swept up
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.100]   in those moments of love, we know that the world
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.060]   can actually change, we know that those moments
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.620]   of love shift and change things in a way that,
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.020]   like I say, no computer can ever predict or ever do.
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.220]   And the reality is also in the reverse.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.220]   You see, strip love from us and we become less than human.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.460]   I would say we become programmable animals
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.460]   that are broken and controlled, but place love within us
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.340]   and we become the very creatures that we have been created
[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.340]   to be, human beings filled with vision and imagination
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.020]   and passion and creativity and hope.
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:38.300]   And if this is who we've truly been created to be
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.220]   and if love is the rawest and most natural form
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.280]   of our expression of what it means to be human,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.900]   could it be, therefore, that as the world embraces
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.420]   more of an AI future, this is an opportunity
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.420]   for the world to actually become more in love with God?
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.420]   Because if it is love that is gonna set us aside
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.340]   from the computers around us, then maybe we should
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.260]   be connecting into the source of that love more than ever.
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.200]   The Bible's very clear where that source comes from.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.260]   It says, God is love.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.420]   It doesn't say God does love, it doesn't say God
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.820]   has this kind of, you know, sort of program to love things.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.020]   It says the actual very nature and essence
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.220]   of who God is is love and because he is love,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.860]   he has first loved us.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.260]   And because he's first loved us, our love then
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.860]   is a response to the love that's been placed
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.620]   within us from him.
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.620]   And if it is love that makes us the most naturally human
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.260]   than we can possibly be and if in an AI future
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.740]   we wanna retain our humanity, then it follows, does it not,
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.580]   that we need to be connecting into the source
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.860]   of where that love comes from.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.820]   I'm excited that the future that may well get more AI
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.820]   is an opportunity for the church to rise up and say,
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.820]   hey, there's one who is able to give us
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.660]   what no computer ever can.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.240]   Love like that remains.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.620]   Which is fascinating because although Paul,
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.980]   the apostle Paul, writing to the church in Corinth
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.580]   had no idea about AI whatsoever, he saw a church
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.420]   that was struggling to truly love.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.620]   In fact, he saw a church that was actually fighting
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.580]   each other, a church that was actually treating
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.220]   each other incredibly poorly and so he decides
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.740]   to write to them in the heart of his letter,
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.940]   chapters 12, 13, and 14 of 1 Corinthians
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.980]   and talk to them about their attitudes and the behaviors
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.340]   and the ways in which they were expressing their humanity
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.340]   towards one another and in chapter 12 and 14,
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.540]   he talks about some of the ways within their church
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.660]   community they were expressing their humanity
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.380]   through both their natural gifts and spiritual gifts
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.420]   and right in between those two chapters in chapter 13,
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.740]   he actually begins to say to them,
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.780]   but you need to understand that if you try to express
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.180]   your humanity without love, then you're not contributing
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.380]   anything to this world, no matter how great your gifts are,
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.860]   no matter how amazing the things that you might be doing
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.600]   are, if it's without love, it is nothing.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.620]   And as he begins to explain this idea of love,
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.580]   he begins to challenge his church in this now
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.060]   but not yet time, this time of advent
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.500]   in which they're living in.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.820]   And we've been basing our advent series here at the Vine
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.780]   over this past month in exactly this passage.
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.260]   I wanna read it to you from 1 Corinthians 13
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.140]   verses eight onwards.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.060]   We started the series with this.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.660]   I wanna finish the series with this.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.340]   Starting in verse eight, he says this.
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.580]   Love never fails, but where there are prophecies,
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.740]   they will cease.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.100]   Where there are tongues, they will be stilled.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.540]   Where there is knowledge, it'll pass away.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.500]   For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.660]   but when perfection comes, talking about the end
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.180]   of all things, the imperfect, this now but not yet time,
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.320]   disappears.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.260]   When I was a child, I taught like a child,
[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.020]   I thought like a child, I responded like a child,
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.940]   but when I became a man, I put those childish ways
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.060]   behind me.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.060]   You see, he's talking about this now but not yet.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.100]   Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror,
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.620]   then we're going to see face to face when Christ returns.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.460]   Now I know in part, he says, but then I shall know fully
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.360]   even as right now I'm fully known.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.180]   And now these three things remain right here
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.620]   in this now but not yet time.
[00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.220]   Faith, hope, and love.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.620]   But the greatest of these is love.
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.060]   I love how Paul is doing this and we've been unpacking this,
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.820]   haven't we, over the last couple of weeks here.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.660]   He's talking about this now but not yet time.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.520]   Christ has come in his first advent that we celebrate
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.360]   at Christmas.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.300]   Christ is returning at the end of all things
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.620]   as a conquering king.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.500]   And he's saying we live in this time where we don't have
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.780]   all the knowledge.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.160]   We don't have everything worked out perfectly.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.100]   We're living in a time where yes, Christ has come,
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.620]   died for our sins and raised, but we're living in a time
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.460]   where sin still has an influence on us and the culmination,
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.180]   the fulfillment of the redemptive story of Christ
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.620]   will only take place when he returns at the end
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.140]   of all things and we live in this longing time,
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.900]   this Maranatha, come Lord Jesus time, but he says,
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.780]   God has not left us alone in the in between.
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.140]   God has given us three things which helps us to navigate
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.700]   when we don't have all the answers,
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.880]   when we don't have it all worked out, when we are longing
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.940]   but we don't see the promises coming through,
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.980]   three things, faith, hope, and love.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.500]   And then he says the greatest of these is love.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.620]   Which should raise an important question for you
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.220]   when you read this 'cause it should ask or cause you
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.540]   to ask the question, why is love the greatest?
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.500]   Because I mean, we've seen how important
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.580]   over the last couple of weeks faith is,
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.980]   how faith is essential to this time
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.780]   and without faith we'd be lost.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.460]   We've seen how hope, hope motivates us and draws us out
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.740]   and makes us the people that we want to be.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.860]   So we know how important faith and hope is.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.900]   Why is love then the greatest?
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.020]   Well, Paul gives a couple of answers.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.220]   His partial answer comes at the start of verse eight.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.460]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.740]   He says, "Love never fails."
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:09.900]   And another way of saying this,
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.220]   actually translating the Greek a little bit better,
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.220]   is love never ends or love never ceases.
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.860]   Which connects with what Paul's saying here
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:21.020]   'cause he says, look, love never ceases
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.340]   but prophecy, that'll cease.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.660]   All this knowledge that we have, yeah, that's gonna cease.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.500]   Even I would argue, Paul would say this,
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.140]   faith and hope, that will also cease
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.980]   but the one thing that never ends, never ceases
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.540]   and therefore never fails is love.
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.100]   I mean, think about this for a second, right?
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.940]   Faith, faith is given to us.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.820]   We've defined faith a couple of weeks ago
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.860]   from Hebrews chapter 11 where it says,
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.420]   "Faith is the confidence of what I hope for
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.980]   "and the assurance of what is not yet seen."
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.740]   So faith is this idea that we have faith
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.660]   in order to get us to the point where Christ returns.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.900]   It is the longing for him to come
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.300]   and it is the idea that I am assured today
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.460]   of what I do not yet see but when Christ comes again,
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.900]   as Paul says in these verses,
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.180]   he says, "Then we will see face to face."
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.980]   So we will see face to face,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.180]   we no longer have to have faith in him
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.700]   'cause the fullness of him will be present with us.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.540]   So faith will cease.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.740]   Same with hope.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.880]   See, hope we've defined last week
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.460]   as this confident expectation,
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.060]   this assurance of what's gonna happen in the future
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.500]   because of our deep understanding of the goodness
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.260]   and the grace of God today.
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.900]   So we are longing for these promises of God to come
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.500]   in this here and now but when he does return
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.420]   at the end of all things, all promises will be fulfilled.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.460]   All promises will be there.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.860]   There'll be no more death, there'll be no more pain,
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.500]   there'll be no more sin or even the possibility of sin.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.500]   There's only one tree at that end of all things
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.940]   other than the two trees that were there in Genesis.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.180]   Everything, all the promises of God
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.540]   and the beauty of Shalom will all be ours.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.580]   We won't need to hope anymore
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.460]   'cause the fullness of hope will be with us.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.820]   Are you following this?
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:11.820]   But love, he says, is the greatest because love never ends.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.540]   In other words, when Christ comes,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.460]   our relationship will be fullness of love with him
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.200]   and with others in that place for all eternity.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.820]   That's the beauty of the Christian story.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.140]   And because that's what we're getting,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.260]   Paul is saying this is the reason why love is the greatest
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.820]   because faith and hope, as important as they are right now,
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.740]   they get us, if you will, to the place where he returns.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.980]   But when he comes, they're no longer needed,
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.220]   but love will endure, love will continue.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.660]   Love will be what we will experience for eternity.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.180]   It's a wonderful thing.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.300]   But I want you to hear something else.
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.860]   He's saying love is the greatest,
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.060]   not just because it'll be the thing
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.620]   that we will have for all eternity.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.540]   It's because we can experience the fullness of it now.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.760]   We don't need to wait until we get there to experience it,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   but it actually can be a part of our human story today.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.080]   Now, to understand what Paul is saying about that,
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.660]   we have to actually understand what he means by love
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.340]   when he uses the word love
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:22.040]   throughout the chapter 13 here in 1 Corinthians.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.820]   You may know that in the Greek language in the first century
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.560]   there were six words in the Greek language
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.300]   that we would translate into English as love.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.020]   The two most popular in the first century was eros,
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.260]   which is kind of sexual or romantic love,
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.940]   and philia, which was like loyal friendship
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.580]   and kind of love that is happening
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.820]   between two committed friends.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.860]   But there was this other word for love,
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.620]   one of the other six words, it's the word agape.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.740]   You probably have heard this
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.540]   if you've been a Christian for some time.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.180]   Agape is this idea of a love
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.620]   that was defined in the Greek culture
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.460]   as radical, sacrificial, selfless love.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.780]   And when the church was thinking,
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.420]   what is the word for love from the Greek language
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.320]   that we're gonna apply to our relationship with God
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.860]   and to who God is, it's this word agape that they chose.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.140]   Now, what's fascinating for us is that we often,
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.060]   when we think of agape love, I think in the church today,
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.580]   we most genuinely focus on God and God's love for us.
[00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.460]   We think God's love is agape, which is absolutely true.
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.140]   But Paul is wanting us to understand
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.100]   that it's not just an agape love that comes from him to us,
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.640]   but agape should also be the love
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.100]   that we give to one another.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.620]   And that, my friends, changes everything.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.460]   And I wanna kind of unpack this by taking you quickly
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.620]   just to another passage outside of Paul.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.660]   This is from 1 John, starting in verse four.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.300]   I want you to listen to how the disciple John writes this.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.100]   In verse 10, he says this.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.660]   He says, "This is agape love, not that we loved God,
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.820]   "but that he loved us and sent his son
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.560]   "as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.440]   "So dear friends, since God so loved us, agaped us,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   "we ought to now agape one another.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.920]   "No one has ever seen God, but if we love God,
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.700]   "sorry, if we love one another, God lives in us
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.220]   "and his love is made complete in us."
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.420]   I think this is really powerful
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.620]   'cause what he's kind of saying here is,
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.820]   here's what the ultimate picture of agape is.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.420]   You wanna know what agape is?
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.280]   This is what it is.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.280]   It is this unadulterated, selfless, other-centered love.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.420]   See, agape is when we give of ourself completely
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   to sacrificing for somebody else's benefit.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.900]   And John goes, "Okay, what's the best picture
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.260]   "I can give you to understand what agape is?"
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.660]   Oh, I know what it is, it's the cross of Jesus.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.060]   How could it be anything else?
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.340]   You wanna see the ultimate picture
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.020]   of what agape looks like?
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.040]   It's a God who so loved the world
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.580]   that he was willing to send his only son
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.620]   into the darkness, into the brokenness,
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.780]   into the sin, into all the pain,
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.100]   come and be born as a helpless, defenseless child,
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.360]   grow up around a world tainted so deeply
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.860]   and marred so ugly with sin,
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.600]   go and be eventually killed on a Roman cross,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.620]   essentially a torture device,
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.980]   in order that everyone else who would ever align
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.360]   in relationship and belief and faith in him
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.740]   would not ever perish to death but know eternal life.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.920]   The writer John is saying, "That's agape.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.160]   "It is completely sacrificial, completely selfless.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.740]   "It is other-sensed love.
[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.740]   "It's the kind of love that would take an old Spanish nun
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:53.800]   "who has never had a person visit her for weeks,
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.780]   "who then shows that person around the church
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.460]   "and is having a great time with that person,
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.620]   "but when somebody turns up who is more in need,
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.740]   "she is willing to let go of that one
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.040]   "and run as fast as she can towards the person in need."
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.000]   That's agape.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.980]   That's sacrificing everything else
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.740]   in order the other would flourish
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.220]   as God would desire them to.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.580]   If I was to give you a definition of agape,
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.780]   here's how I would straightaway define it.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.300]   Agape love is the overflow of our delight in God
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.620]   that joyfully cherishes and seeks
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.820]   the best interest of another,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.380]   even when it comes at great sacrifice to ourselves.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.180]   I want you to hear what John says here.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.460]   He says, "Here's the greatest example of agape love.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.960]   "It's the cross, but because we have the cross,
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.200]   "because God has loved us like that,
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.940]   "we now," he says, "should love one another."
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.560]   He doesn't say we now should eros one another
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.560]   or philea one another.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.800]   He says we should agape one another.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.280]   In other words, the sacrifice seen on the cross
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.320]   should be the starting point for how we now love each other
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.120]   and that if we could love each other in that way,
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.240]   we might actually begin to model
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.480]   and shape the future of this world
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.260]   to be a place that when Christ returns,
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.000]   we would come to see the fullness of that love fulfilled.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.200]   This, my friends, is what Christmas is all about.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.840]   The love of Christmas is agape love in its fullness.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.680]   It is the decision that God made to give his son.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.860]   And of course, the cross is going to happen later,
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.240]   but in that moment in Bethlehem,
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.880]   in that moment of calling Mary,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   this sacrificial love comes to us
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.520]   so that we would eventually know
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.280]   how it is that we should treat one another.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.120]   Think of it this way.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   Jesus is God's expression of other-centered love,
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.640]   which comes at a high cost,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.400]   the highest cost of one who gives up his life,
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.180]   gives something so that everyone else might receive.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.720]   That's Christmas.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.520]   That's what we're gonna be celebrating on Wednesday.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.080]   That should be driving everything we think about
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.800]   as we go through this season
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.600]   that we're celebrating right now,
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.760]   that Jesus is this representative of agape love,
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.560]   something given so that everybody else can receive.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.160]   And if you look through the Christmas story,
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.620]   it's a story of agape love.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.600]   I mean, think about Mary and Joseph
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.560]   who had to sacrifice their reputation
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.200]   and what everybody else thought of them
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.240]   and all the judgment everybody was making
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.740]   because they were unmarried and she was pregnant,
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.040]   but they were willing to sacrifice it
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.880]   in obedience to what God had called them to do, agape.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.560]   Think about the shepherds,
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.480]   the shepherds who are called by the angels in the sky
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.600]   to leave behind over a year's worth of finances,
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.720]   their livelihood in the sheep,
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.040]   and leave them to wander off into the wilderness
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.160]   so that they could go to Bethlehem and meet the Savior,
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.800]   agape love.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.200]   The magi who travel from afar,
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.920]   that's not where their love was found.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.560]   Their love was found in the fact
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.100]   that they were willing to risk their own lives
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.860]   by disobeying what Herod had said
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.640]   and said, "Come back and let me know where Jesus is."
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.040]   When the magi decided they were not going to return
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   to let Herod know,
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   they were putting their lives at central risk, agape love.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   So when we think about Christmas,
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.600]   what we should be asking ourselves is,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.880]   are we living this agape love?
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.080]   It's a challenging question
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.880]   and it's the question you have to have in mind
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.480]   when you read 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.760]   I wanna take you actually to the beginning of the chapter.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.720]   Now that you've got that context in mind,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.360]   now that we understand a little bit more
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.280]   of what this love is that we're being called to,
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   now we go back and we actually read
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.660]   what Paul is trying to teach to his church
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.080]   at the beginning of 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.160]   And let me say this,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.480]   it is not about marriage or weddings.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.040]   You've heard this a lot of times
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.360]   and as I start to read this,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.680]   you're immediately gonna think of a wedding.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.360]   Please do not.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.720]   I want you to stay seated in the bigger picture
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.560]   of what I'm talking about.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.840]   Does that make sense to you?
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   Okay, let me read this to you.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.240]   This is 1 Corinthians 13, starting in verse one.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.600]   If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels,
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.000]   but have not love,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.080]   I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.200]   If I have the gift of prophecy
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.700]   and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.240]   if I have faith that can move mountains,
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.360]   but not love, I am nothing.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.840]   If I give all I possess to the poor
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.740]   and surrender my body to the flames,
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.160]   but have not love, I gain nothing.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.600]   It's fascinating what Paul does here.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.440]   He basically is talking to the Corinth church
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.880]   about their natural and spiritual gifts.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.760]   But I think we can broaden it to us
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.360]   to think about humanity and how we express our humanity.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.760]   And he mentions three things in these three verses.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.740]   Then the first verse, he basically says,
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.960]   what if somebody was a really good speaker,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.340]   a really good presenter, told a really great story,
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.180]   but if they did it without love, it's nothing.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.240]   In the second one, he talks about wisdom and knowledge
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.700]   and prophecy and understanding.
[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.600]   It's like he's saying, hey, if you had someone
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.120]   who did a great TED Talk and opened up a new way of thinking,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.040]   gave you data to understand something,
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:10.280]   and you were like blown away by their intellect
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.160]   and their wonder and what they thought,
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.900]   but if they did that without love, it's nothing.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.120]   Then in the third bucket, he says,
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.480]   what about you have someone who looks like they're loving,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.760]   but they're not?
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   In other words, they're giving away.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.800]   They're giving away all their money.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.040]   They're giving away all their time.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.400]   They're loving in what looks like a sacrificial way,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.120]   but they do it without sacrificial love.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.240]   It is nothing.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.720]   Which is Paul saying something
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.000]   very challenging to the church.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.680]   He's saying, if you really want to be human,
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.440]   if you wanna be the way that God has created you to be,
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.160]   you can do all of these things
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.120]   that on the surface appear great human things.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.320]   Oh, the artist who tells an amazing story.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.960]   Oh, the incredibly smart person who knows it all.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.520]   Oh, the person who's so generous with everything I have.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.200]   You can do all of those things,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.720]   but if you do them without love, here's what happens,
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.800]   and this is very important.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.400]   He says, you are nothing.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.580]   Notice, he does not say, your gift is nothing.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.600]   He doesn't say, hey, if you do all these great things
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.800]   without love, then the gift is worthless
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.080]   and nothing will happen.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.280]   No, he says, you're worthless.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.980]   You have gained nothing.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.920]   You are nothing.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.280]   I can get up here, and this challenges me deeply.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.760]   I can get up here and do an amazing sermon
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.380]   and wow you with my oratory
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.560]   and tell you incredible stories about nuns in Spain.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:35.000]   I can do all of this, and you can leave here going,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.960]   that was a great message.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.880]   Wow, God spoke to me, and I learned something,
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.680]   which can happen, and I can do that without love,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.840]   and you can still go away being blessed,
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.620]   but I am nothing.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.360]   This is the danger of what Paul's saying.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.400]   He's saying we can have a world where it appears
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.800]   like there's all this great human wisdom,
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.400]   all this great human stuff,
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.920]   but when it's done without agape,
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.840]   when it's done without sacrificial other-centered thinking,
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.480]   what it essentially will do is basically try
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.280]   to build yourself up rather than build anyone else up.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.200]   See, I can preach the greatest sermon to you,
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.280]   but if I don't have love, I'm essentially trying
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.640]   to make myself great and not Christ great.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.160]   If I do it without love, I'm not actually thinking
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.560]   about you, I'm thinking about me.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.440]   I'm thinking about making sure this is the perfect sermon
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.480]   that you're gonna love, and you're gonna go
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.520]   and tell all your friends, and more people
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.280]   will come to the vine, 'cause that's about me.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.520]   It's about my church.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.280]   It's about this stuff here, and Paul's saying,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   when you do that, you are nothing,
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.840]   and Paul's saying, I don't want you to be nothing.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:43.640]   I want you to be something.
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.480]   I want you to be the very person
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.400]   that Christ has called you to be, who he's made you to be,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.280]   so he's saying do those things, yes,
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.400]   but do them from sacrificial, other-centered love,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.880]   and when you love like that, oh, the world changes,
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.520]   he's saying, when you love like that,
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.480]   things shift and change, but when you fail
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:09.240]   as a human being to love agape ways,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   you will always end up imaging yourself to the world.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.160]   You will always end up filling the earth with your glory,
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.360]   and you will basically fail to become the person
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.720]   that you were called to be.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.800]   It's really important that you hear that.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.000]   When we fail to live as human beings
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.880]   from a place of agape love, we image ourself to the world,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.840]   we fill the earth with our glory,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.080]   and we fail to become the people
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.720]   that we were actually intended to be,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.760]   and when that happens, that breaks the heart of God.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:45.080]   Agape is this incredible thought
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.440]   that actually I was designed to give everything to you
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.680]   so that you would be the best that you can be,
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.040]   trusting that you're gonna give everything to me
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   so that I might become the best that I can be,
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.140]   and we do that because God has first loved us.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.080]   We're not trying to love sacrificially
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.000]   in our own strength, we're not trying to love one another
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.040]   in our niceness and try to be a little bit better humans,
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.800]   no, I've received a sacrificial love
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.520]   that is founded in the cross of Christ,
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.720]   and out of the overflow of gratitude,
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.480]   out of the overflow of feeling that love
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.440]   and forgiveness of my sins for myself,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.000]   I can now stand before others
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.380]   and want the very best for you
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.800]   without thinking what's the very best for me.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.280]   This is radical because what Paul's essentially doing here
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.800]   is he's turning upside down,
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.520]   common thinking about self-help and self-love.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.920]   See, this world is like, hey, you need some more self-love.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   Oh, get on that retreat, get away, prioritize yourself,
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.620]   put up more boundaries, make sure you're better,
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.360]   make sure that you've got your time,
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.160]   make sure you're prioritizing you,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.600]   love your truth, love yourself,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.200]   and Paul's flipping it all upside down,
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.080]   and he's saying you wanna know where self-love is?
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.540]   It's found in other-centered love.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:07.600]   You wanna know how to flourish yourself best?
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.440]   Give yourself away.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.360]   You wanna know how to feel the best
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.560]   that you could ever feel?
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.160]   Love others like they're the center of your world.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.280]   When you do that, something transcendent happens,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.240]   and you become fully alive.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.080]   When a nun hitches up her habit and runs to a broken man,
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.200]   when I go over not understanding a word
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.560]   but lay a hand on his shoulder,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.440]   not knowing anything about his story,
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.160]   I can feel the most alive that I have felt ever.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.920]   When we truly agape in this world,
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.720]   we actually love ourselves,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.440]   which is a very beautiful, complicated,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.880]   incredibly deep theological, but also very practical thing,
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.320]   and it's this practical thing that Paul now turns to.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.640]   Let me show you these words that he then speaks of,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.800]   and these are so famous to us, but again,
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.440]   try to follow along with this new thinking we have
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.240]   about sacrificial love for the other's benefit.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.560]   He says love is patient, love is kind.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.360]   It does not envy, it does not boast,
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.000]   it is not proud, it is not rude, it is not self-seeking,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.560]   it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.040]   Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.440]   It always protects, always trusts,
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.720]   always hopes, always perseveres.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.440]   It's really important you understand
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.200]   that what Paul's not doing here is trying to define love.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.280]   Remember I said earlier at the start,
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.720]   it's hard for us to find the words that define love.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.240]   He's not trying to define love here.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.960]   What he's trying to say is you wanna know
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.400]   what a world looks like when people agape one another?
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.600]   You wanna know what it feels like for you
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.320]   when somebody agapes to you?
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.200]   You wanna know what it feels like
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.600]   when you're able to give of someone else?
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.440]   It feels like this, but also,
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.580]   you wanna know what happens when we don't do those things
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.560]   from a place of love, when we don't find love
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.420]   as the driving factor to the way in which we serve
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.920]   and love one another, well, it then feels
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.920]   and seems and acts like this.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.720]   So he's not trying to define some dictionary version of love.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.960]   He's trying to paint a picture of how the world might be
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.400]   and give us the reason why the world
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.840]   isn't always like that.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.880]   So he gives seven descriptors of positive outcomes
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.480]   and eight of negative.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.640]   Look at this.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.400]   What love is, patient, kind, truthful,
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.680]   protects, trusts, hopes, perseveres.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.160]   What it isn't, envious, boastful, proud, rude,
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.680]   self-seeking, angry, shameful, evil.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.320]   What he's essentially saying is this.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.840]   If you do all the great things you can do as a human being,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.720]   whether that's great speaking or great knowledge
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.880]   or great generosity, but you do it without love,
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.760]   here's what you're putting out in the world.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.880]   You're putting out envious, boastful, proud, rude,
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.960]   self-seeking, angry, shameful, and essentially evil.
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.960]   That's what you're shaping in the world.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.160]   But when you love with agape in the way
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.320]   that Christ has loved you and demonstrates
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.640]   that love on the cross, well, here's what you put out
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.480]   in the world.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.320]   You're patient.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.240]   You have long suffering with those that don't always get it
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.800]   or kind of annoy you or kind of have hurt you.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.440]   You have this kind, truthfulness to you.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.720]   You protect, you trust, you hope, persevere.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.960]   You wanna do all these things for others in the world.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.800]   And Paul's not saying, hey, don't do these things,
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.520]   try and do these things.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.120]   He's not saying, okay, the application of this sermon
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.000]   is just to try to be nicer this week, okay?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.200]   If you could try to be nicer, that would go a long way.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.600]   That's not what Paul's trying to say to his church.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.120]   It's not what I'm trying to say to you this morning.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.040]   This is not about finding within yourself more niceness.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.240]   This is about realizing that the love that we receive
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.920]   through the Holy Spirit, remember, the fruit
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.120]   of the Holy Spirit, first of all, is love.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.360]   The love that we receive through the Holy Spirit,
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.280]   which is other-centered and sacrificial to us,
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.600]   overflows within us and causes us to want to do anything
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.800]   other than these things, causes us to want to serve
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.440]   and to love and be kind and be grateful.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.320]   It's not about trying to be nicer
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.280]   so I'm on the right side of the equation.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.080]   It's about asking the Holy Spirit to create a fruit
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.980]   of agape in me so that when a broken man walks
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.240]   into a church, I'm the first one to run rather than the nun.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.960]   Come on, church.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.700]   I got such a thing, she had such a thing in her
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.160]   that when he stepped in, she went straight away
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.400]   and left me behind.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.240]   It hurt.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.560]   No, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.560]   [congregation laughing]
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.440]   But I could tell the tour was over.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.320]   But why wasn't I the first one to run?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.800]   Like, where is this agape-ness with me?
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.440]   When I look at these lists, if I'm honest with you,
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.120]   I connect a little bit more on that side.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.960]   I realize that so often, my thinking is so self-centered
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.880]   and not other-centered.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.960]   And I realize that if we could flip that around
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.080]   and begin to love in the only ways that Christ has loved us,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   which is always other-centered, never for his gain,
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.560]   but for ours, man, could you imagine what the world
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.040]   would be like if we could live like that?
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.360]   See, it's that kind of love that enables you
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.560]   to turn the other cheek.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.600]   It's that kind of love that enables you to embrace an enemy.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   It's that kind of love that causes you to take your cloak off
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.400]   and give it to someone.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.560]   It's that kind of love that actually asks you
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.680]   to repent of your sin.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.640]   It's that kind of love that causes you to give to those
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.000]   who could never repay you.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.960]   It's that kind of love that causes you to get on your knees
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.760]   and to pray for this world.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:37.360]   It's that kind of love that is other-centered focus
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.120]   that changes it all.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.440]   And it's really important that you understand
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.800]   that this is not a soft love, no.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.720]   Agape love is not the kind of love that just kind of
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.000]   lies down and lets everything walk over it.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.800]   It's not the kind of love that tolerates everything,
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.040]   that kind of allows everything to happen.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.000]   It's not the kind of love that denies yourself nothing.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.440]   No, this kind of love, as Paul describes,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.160]   it rejoices with the truth.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.640]   It does not delight, he says, with evil.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.080]   So this is not a love that just basically says to the church,
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.880]   hey, just treat everybody how, you know, whatever,
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.680]   and just, you know, everything goes,
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.000]   and there's nothing bad in the world,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.400]   and like, don't be mean to, you know,
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.600]   well, you shouldn't be mean to anyone, but you know.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.080]   It's the kind of love that's not so soft and whimsical
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.520]   that it's like, hey, anything goes,
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.440]   just live your life and it's cool, be your truth.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.540]   No, it's the kind of love that rejoices with truth of God,
[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.660]   that rejoices with scripture and the promises of God,
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.440]   that actually understands that and doesn't delight
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.040]   in the distortions of those things,
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.640]   doesn't delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.480]   It's the kind of love that actually causes us to say,
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.480]   hey, I love you doesn't mean I accept everything
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.120]   that comes out of your mouth, everything that you do.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.560]   My love of you, my agape of you,
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.820]   doesn't mean you can just act however you want against me.
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:39:58.720]   Right?
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.340]   It's not like a soft love.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.040]   It is a robust, beautiful, tough, run-through-the-church
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.320]   towards the broken kind of love
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.840]   that stands for the truth of God's word,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.240]   even when that might come at a cost.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.600]   Oh, a cost.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.960]   Maybe agape love is sown more beautifully in cost
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.240]   than in anything else.
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.880]   And when we're found in those moments,
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.400]   it changes everything for us.
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.480]   And I remember the great privilege I had
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.040]   of standing next to that man
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.160]   as he wept the horror of 20 years
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.120]   of being a homicide detective out of himself
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.920]   whilst he was being administered to by a nun,
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.440]   unadulterated agape love.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.840]   The man just sat there for about half an hour
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.280]   after we prayed for him, just on his own,
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.760]   just weeping and gently being ministered to.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.240]   The nun took me to the side.
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.040]   And as she went to the side, she reached into her habit
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.860]   and she pulled out this.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.800]   She pulled out a pendant.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.280]   This is the exact pendant that she pulled out.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.400]   And in Spanish, she explained something about this pendant
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.600]   that I will never know.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.480]   But apparently it was very important.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.840]   And she placed it in my hand like this.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.680]   And she clasped her hand over my hand.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.120]   And she said something in Spanish,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.480]   which I assume was, I want you to take this
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.080]   to remember this moment of love.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:29.040]   As I left the church, here's what God was saying to me.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.960]   He was saying, Andrew, I've placed pendants of love
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.200]   around your neck over the years
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.680]   that I'm calling you to take off and give
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.520]   to those around you.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.360]   That's agape.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.640]   And as I close our series on Advent,
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.800]   and as we prepare our hearts for Christmas on Wednesday,
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   let me ask you the same thing.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.440]   What pendants of love has Christ placed over you
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.200]   over the last number of years
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.200]   that you might now be able to remove
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.040]   and give outwardly towards the other?
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.600]   Do that and the greatest of these remains.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.280]   Can we pray?
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.100]   Let's pray.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:12.200]   Father, we are deeply grateful
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.400]   that you love with agape love,
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.480]   other-centered, sacrificial, loving in its fullness.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.560]   Lord, we recognize that we have distorted such love
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.440]   and that it's not just the world that distorts it,
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.080]   but the church does at times too.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.920]   And we recognize, Lord, that often we live
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.840]   in a lesser vision of love
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.880]   and that we act out a lesser vision of love.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.560]   But we recognize that so often we can be selfish,
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.880]   self-centered, that even in pretending to be loving,
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.080]   we're actually just looking after ourselves.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.520]   Father, I pray for anyone here this morning
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.160]   where that might be part of their story,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.720]   that they would have the courage today
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.880]   to bring that to you,
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:09.240]   that in your agape love,
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.840]   we would, out of your kindness, be led to repentance.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:17.080]   Lord, I recognize also that there's people in this room
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.760]   watching online in our overflow
[00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.320]   who have been hurt by broken love,
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:25.680]   who somebody else's brokenness of love
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.040]   has acted upon them in ways that has deeply hurt them.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.440]   Father, I pray for anyone here where that's their story.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.080]   And because of how broken love has impacted them,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.280]   they have been loving brokenly themselves.
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.000]   Father, we do know that we are able to love
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.040]   because you first loved us.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.480]   And I pray that if there's anyone in this room
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.720]   where that's a bit of their journey
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.800]   or a bit of their story right now,
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.200]   they've been broken and hurt by love
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.160]   and they find that they're swept up in that story,
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.840]   I wanna pray, Lord, that your Spirit,
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.360]   which you have poured out in this time,
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.760]   in this now but not yet time
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.120]   between your birth and your return,
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.320]   I pray that that Spirit and the fruit
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.200]   of that Spirit of love, pure, unadulterated,
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.000]   agape, sacrificial, selfless, other-scented love
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.320]   would fall on them,
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:23.040]   would come up and be birthed within them for your glory.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.360]   Lord, I pray for families
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.400]   that have been torn apart by broken love.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.720]   Father, I pray for husbands and wives in this room,
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.080]   those that are struggling to love,
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.120]   those that perhaps loved before
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:42.400]   but find themselves without it in this time,
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.280]   marriages that are strained and difficult.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:52.680]   Lord, we don't downplay that, we don't brush over that.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.360]   And Lord, we recognize that the only thing
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.120]   that heals that kind of brokenness
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:02.360]   is the kind of love that is seen on the cross of Christ
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.880]   and a love that brings us once again
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.280]   to the most natural state of what it is to be human.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.320]   Lord, I pray for marriages in this room
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.520]   that you would restore agape love in the name of Jesus.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.920]   Lord, I pray for businesses and families.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.540]   I pray for relationships that have been strained.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.080]   Lord, we pray that we would be able to become a church
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.720]   that has received such agape love ourselves
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.240]   that we cannot but help to move out in that love
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.120]   for the glory of Christ, imaging you to the world
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.960]   and not ourselves.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.520]   Lord, as we come to celebrate your birth on Wednesday,
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.520]   would it be this agapeness that would mark the Vine Church?
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.760]   Would it mark us in the days ahead?
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.520]   And would it mark us as we enter into 2025
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.480]   and all the things that you have for us ahead?
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.000]   Would we love in the way that you truly called us to love?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.480]   And we give you glory for this, in Jesus' name.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.080]   Would you stand with me and we're going
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.720]   to just respond together in a time of worship.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.300]   (gentle music)
