1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to him.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,800
 A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,520
 and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,360
 Where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,200
 rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,120
 A church that does not make its Sunday services the exclamation mark of its existence,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,320
 but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,000
 A time of service, love, and engagement that inspires and emboldens all equally

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,280
 for the conversation that lies ahead.

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:49,480
 A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,720
 This is our city.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,000
 This is our church.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,320
 This is our home.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,480
 Good morning and welcome.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
 Welcome to the Vineyulong.

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,640
 It is so great to see you all.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,440
 Today is an exciting day.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,120
 Does anyone know why today is an exciting day?

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,040
 Yes, we can eat.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
 We're going to break the fast.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
 I'm ready.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,360
 Hey, on that note, I hope that you have been, as we've been setting aside time

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:35,680
 for 21 days to fast, to seek God personally, but also corporately as a church family,

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,000
 that you have encountered God in fresh and new ways.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,080
 And I hope that you have been encouraged and strengthened in your faith.

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,640
 I know that I have.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,080
 And I've been so encouraged by being able to do this together as a church.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,680
 I've been so encouraged by that.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,640
 Because if you try to do it on your own, it's a lot harder.

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,400
 So today we're going to, in a moment, enter into worship, but I want to invite you to

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 prepare our hearts.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,920
 So let's quiet down for a moment.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,240
 There's been a lot going on during this week.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,440
 You know, maybe it's been a good one, maybe it's been a tough one.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,520
 And I just want to ask you to just give to the Lord right now, whatever's on.

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,040
 His word says that we can cast our anxieties on Him, because He cares for us.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
 So let's do that right now.

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,880
 Let's just share whatever's been weighing on our hearts.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:49,000
 Let's just give that to Him right now.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,360
 I want to invite everyone to stand and I'll pray for us.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:05,000
 Jesus, we thank you so much that we can know you, that you make yourself known to us.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,120
 We thank you for this fasting season and how you've met us, how you spoke to us, how you

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,760
 gave revelation to us, direction to us.

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,400
 We also thank you that we could set aside this time to step with you into 2024, not

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,040
 to run ahead on our own strength and our own wisdom, but to really just say, Lord, we want

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
 to do it with you.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,400
 We want to hear from you.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
 We want to be led by you.

49
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,880
 We want to do it by your spirit, by your power, not out of our own strength.

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,320
 And so right now we want to give you praise, Lord.

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,280
 May our worship be pleasing and honoring to you.

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,280
 I pray this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Let's worship.

53
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:16,600
 Amazing love that welcomes me, the kindness of mercy.

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:41,920
 God, you're so good.

55
00:04:41,920 --> 00:05:08,240
 You're so good to me.

56
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:35,560
 God, you're so good.

57
00:05:35,560 --> 00:06:03,880
 You're so good to me.

58
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 I am blessed.

59
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 You are.

183
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:43,880
 And rain came, wind blew, and my house was built on you.

184
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,880
 I'm safe with you.

185
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,880
 I'm going to make it through.

186
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
 The rain came.

187
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:02,880
 Rain came, wind blew, my house was built on you.

188
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,880
 And I'm safe with you.

189
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,880
 I'm going to make it through.

190
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
 Oh, the rain came.

191
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,880
 Rain came, wind blew, my house was built on you.

192
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
 And I'm safe with you.

193
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
 I'm safe with you.

194
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,880
 I'm going to make it through.

195
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,880
 Oh, the rain came.

196
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,880
 Rain came, wind blew, my house was built on you.

197
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,880
 And I'm safe with you.

198
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,880
 I'm going to make it through.

199
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
 I'm going to make it.

200
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,880
 I'm going to make it through.

201
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,880
 Because my house was built on you.

202
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
 I'm going to make it.

203
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,880
 I'm going to make it through.

204
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 Because my house was built on you.

205
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
 I'm going to make it.

206
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,880
 I'm going to make it through.

207
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
 Because my house is built on you.

208
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
 I'm going to make it.

209
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 I'm going to make it through.

210
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,880
 Because my house is built on you.

211
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,880
 Christ is my foundation.

212
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:41,880
 The rock on which I stand, when everything around me is shaken.

213
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:51,880
 I've never been more glad that I put my faith in Jesus.

214
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,880
 He's never let me down.

215
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,880
 He's faithful through generations.

216
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,880
 So why would he fail now?

217
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
 He won't.

218
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,880
 He won't.

219
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,880
 He won't fail.

220
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 He won't fail.

221
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,880
 He won't.

222
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
 No, he won't.

223
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
 He won't.

224
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,880
 He won't fail.

225
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,880
 He won't fail.

226
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,880
 He won't.

227
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
 No, he won't.

228
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
 He won't.

229
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
 He won't.

230
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,880
 He won't fail.

231
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,880
 He won't fail.

232
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,880
 He won't.

233
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
 No, he won't.

234
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,880
 He won't.

235
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
 He won't fail.

236
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,880
 He won't fail.

237
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 He won't.

238
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 [MUSIC - "HE WON'T FAIL"]

239
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,880
 [MUSIC - "HE WON'T FAIL"]

240
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:17,880
 Oh, Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder

241
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:31,880
 consider all the works thy hath made,

242
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
 I see the star.

243
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:50,880
 I hear the rolling thunder by Passuwack.

244
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:59,880
 The yule beavers display, and sings my soul.

245
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:09,880
 And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

246
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,880
 How great thou art.

247
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 How great thou art.

248
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,880
 Oh, how great thou art.

249
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,880
 How great thou art.

250
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:36,880
 And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

251
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,880
 How great thou art.

252
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,880
 How great thou art.

253
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,880
 How great thou art.

254
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:06,880
 And when I think that God his Son not spare him,

255
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:16,880
 sent him to die, I scarce can make it in.

256
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 And on the cross my burden gladly bearing,

257
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:42,880
 he bled and died to take away my sin.

258
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:56,880
 And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

259
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,880
 How great thou art.

260
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,880
 How great thou art.

261
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,880
 And sings my soul.

262
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 And sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

263
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
 How great thou art.

264
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
 How great thou art.

265
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,880
 How great thou art.

266
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:51,880
 Then I shall bow with shouts of acclamation,

267
00:22:51,880 --> 00:23:01,880
 and take me home where joy shall fill my heart.

268
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:17,880
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration,

269
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:27,880
 and there proclaim, my God, how great thou art,

270
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,880
 when Christ shall come, when Christ shall come.

271
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:47,880
 With shouts of acclamation and take me home,

272
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:55,880
 where joy shall fill my heart.

273
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 Then I shall bow in humble adoration,

274
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:18,880
 and there proclaim, my God, how great thou art.

275
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,880
 Then sings my soul.

276
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:31,880
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

277
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
 How great thou art.

278
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 How great thou art.

279
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,880
 Oh, how great thou art.

280
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 How great thou art.

281
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

282
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,880
 How great thou art.

283
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 How great thou art.

284
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
 How great thou art.

285
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 Then sings my soul.

286
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

287
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,880
 How great thou art.

288
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 How great thou art.

289
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,880
 Oh, how great thou art.

290
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,880
 How great thou art.

291
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:48,880
 Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee.

292
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 How great thou art.

293
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 How great thou art.

294
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 Lord, we praise you.

295
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 And we are humbled by your faithfulness,

296
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
 that you are faithful to us.

297
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,880
 You never fail us.

298
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
 Thank you, Jesus, for laying down your life for us

299
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,880
 so that we can be forgiven, that we can have new life.

300
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,880
 Thank you for loving us in such an incredible way.

301
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,880
 Lord, and we are humbled, and we are in awe.

302
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,880
 And we declare and we confess our faith in you.

303
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,880
 So we give you all the praise.

304
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,880
 And we pray all this in your name, Jesus.

305
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 Amen.

306
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 Amen.

307
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
 Thank you, worship team and production team,

308
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 for so beautifully leading us.

309
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
 You may be seated.

310
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
 Hey, right now we have a celebration.

311
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,880
 And it is a child dedication.

312
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,880
 So I want to invite Joshua and Esther and Deborah and family

313
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
 and friends to come on up.

314
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
 So they're getting ready.

315
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,880
 And friends, you can already come up if you know them.

316
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,880
 We have a tradition that we just stand with them.

317
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 So if you know Joshua, if you know Deborah,

318
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
 if you're a family member, just come on up.

319
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,880
 Oh, this is like a grand entrance right here.

320
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,880
 Yeah, come on up.

321
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 If you know them, come on up and let's stand together here.

322
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 All right, there's Deborah and--

323
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 Wow.

324
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 And baby Esther, so beautiful.

325
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 Yeah, you can stand up here.

326
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
 Yeah.

327
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 Wow.

328
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 What a precious baby girl.

329
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 So this is Joshua, Deborah, Esther.

330
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 We also have Joshua's mom right there, who came from Nigeria--

331
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,880
 Yes.

332
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 --to support them with the birth of the child.

333
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,880
 And so hey, now biblically, the reason

334
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 why we sell a child dedication or why we practice this

335
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
 is because this is actually something that's been happening

336
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 throughout biblical history.

337
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 There's a Hannah who dedicated Samuel to the Lord.

338
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,880
 There's Joseph and Mary who dedicated Jesus.

339
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,880
 And so it's a way of saying everything we have

340
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
 is a gift and a blessing from God,

341
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,880
 and we want to give this to you.

342
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,880
 And so this is what Joshua and Deborah are saying about Esther,

343
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,880
 that she is a beautiful and precious gift from God.

344
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
 And they want to offer her to the Lord and just say, Lord,

345
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,880
 we want you to bless her.

346
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,880
 And we want to-- yeah, our heart is for her to know you.

347
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
 And so that's what we're celebrating.

348
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 So what we're going to do is we have three questions

349
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,880
 for three different groups of people.

350
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,880
 So first, I have a question for mom and dad.

351
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
 Then I have a question for family and friends.

352
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
 And then afterwards, I have actually a question

353
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,880
 for the whole congregation.

354
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,880
 And so let me ask you the first question.

355
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,880
 So will you raise Esther in an atmosphere

356
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
 of God's unconditional love?

357
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,880
 Will you teach Esther to the best of your ability

358
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
 the ways she should go?

359
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,880
 Will you teach Esther about Jesus Christ and his love

360
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 for all humanity?

361
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,880
 And will you pray for Esther to be a child

362
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,880
 that will be used for God's glory?

363
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 If so, please respond, "I will."

364
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
 Yes, we will.

365
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
 We will.

366
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
 Yes.

367
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,880
 [applause]

368
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
 Hi.

369
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,880
 Aw, thank you.

370
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,880
 Okay, this question is for friends and family.

371
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,880
 Will you commit to supporting Joshua and Deborah

372
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
 in this journey of parenthood?

373
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,880
 Will you be patient with them, listen to them,

374
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,880
 help them when they need support?

375
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,880
 Will you also be models and examples to Christ's love

376
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,880
 that Esther grows up in an environment, in a community

377
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,880
 that will always point her towards her creator?

378
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 If so, please respond, "We will."

379
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
 We will.

380
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 All right.

381
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,880
 [applause]

382
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,880
 And this one is for all of you, and I really want to hear

383
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,880
 aloud, "We will," okay?

384
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,880
 So will we as brothers and sisters in Christ

385
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,880
 remember as often as we can to pray for this new family,

386
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,880
 to reach out and support whenever appropriate and necessary?

387
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 Would we be a church that welcomes children

388
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 just as Jesus did?

389
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,880
 If so, please respond, "We will."

390
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 We will.

391
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
 Amen.

392
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,880
 [applause]

393
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,880
 And so what we're going to do now is we're going to pray for them.

394
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,880
 First I'm going to invite family and friends just to start

395
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 praying over them all at the same time, and then Francesca

396
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,880
 will pray, and then I will pray a prayer as well.

397
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
 So let's do that right now, and you also, let's carry them

398
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
 in prayer as well.

399
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,880
 You can stretch out your hands towards them.

400
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,880
 [praying in Tongues]

401
00:31:40,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 [praying in Tongues]

402
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for Esther, this beautiful

403
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,880
 and precious gift you've given to Joshua and Deborah

404
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
 and the family and our community.

405
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,880
 We lift up Esther to you and pray that she'll grow and feed

406
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,880
 on your word and that she will choose a personal relationship

407
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
 with you.

408
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,880
 May she be so in tune with your heart that she can distinguish

409
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,880
 your loving voice from the voices of this world.

410
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 And your word says that the pure in heart are blessed.

411
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,880
 I also pray this child will yearn for a life of purity and

412
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,880
 holiness and that the joy of her heart will come from walking

413
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,880
 in steps with you.

414
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,880
 And Lord, I pray that she may grow in grace and knowledge of

415
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 your ways and that she will have a sense of awe and respect in

416
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
 your presence, Lord.

417
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,880
 And Lord, we pray for blessings and protection over this family.

418
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,880
 May you guide Joshua and Deborah and the family to seek your

419
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,880
 heart and to bring up this child in your ways.

420
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
 And thank you, Lord.

421
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,880
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

422
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,880
 Lord Jesus, I also pray for Deborah, for Joshua.

423
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,880
 As they are parent to Esther, I pray that you bless them, that

424
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,880
 you give them wisdom on how to raise Esther in the knowledge of

425
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
 you.

426
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 I pray that you give them the grace and the strength that

427
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 parenting takes, that you give them patience when they need

428
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 patience.

429
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,880
 I pray also that you bless their marriage, that you strengthen

430
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,880
 them as a couple, that you learn, that you continue to grow

431
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,880
 them deeper in love for each other and deeper in love for

432
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
 you.

433
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
 I pray that you allow them to be encouragement to each other.

434
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,880
 But Lord, I also want to pray especially Esther on this

435
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
 special day.

436
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 I thank you for her, for this precious gift that she is to you.

437
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,880
 I pray for your anointing and blessing and for your Holy

438
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
 Spirit's filling of her.

439
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,880
 I pray that she will know your love.

440
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,880
 I pray that you will do her a favor in her life.

441
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
 And we are so grateful for her.

442
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,880
 And we celebrate this life that you have given to her.

443
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,880
 And so we pray this in your name, Jesus, amen.

444
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
 Amen.

445
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,880
 [Applause]

446
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
 Yes.

447
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
 What a joyous occasion.

448
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,880
 Congratulations.

449
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
 So cute.

450
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
 It's so little.

451
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
 Yeah.

452
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,880
 So by the way, since we do have a lot of children and babies, if

453
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,880
 you do want to dedicate your child, your baby to the Lord,

454
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,880
 you can just let Pastor Ivan or myself know and we can help

455
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
 arrange a time to do that.

456
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,880
 We want to at this point in time welcome anyone here who is here

457
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
 for the first time today.

458
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
 If you don't mind just slipping up your hand, we just want to

459
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
 say hi.

460
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
 A little yes, welcome.

461
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
 It's great to have you.

462
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
 Thank you for joining us.

463
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,880
 If you would like to connect with us, there's a QR code.

464
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,880
 You can -- yeah, let us know how we can help you find footing

465
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
 here in this community.

466
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,880
 Also right now, as we do every Sunday, I want to pray for you

467
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
 kids.

468
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,880
 I want to pray for your time in K4C.

469
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,880
 So if you see a child, let's stretch out our hands and let's

470
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
 pray for them.

471
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,880
 Jesus, we thank you for every single child that is here.

472
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,880
 We thank you that you love every single one of them.

473
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,880
 We pray that they would come to know your love, that you would

474
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,880
 bless them as they go into K4C, that they will grow in the

475
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,880
 knowledge of you, that will form their own relationship with you.

476
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,880
 We also pray for a great time, that they have a great time of

477
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
 the day.

478
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,880
 So parents, you may bring your children to K4C.

479
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,880
 We have two to five -- three to five years and six to 12 years

480
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
 over here.

481
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,880
 If you have a young baby, you're also welcome to go on the crash

482
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
 the service is being streamed live from there as well.

483
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,880
 So during this time while the parents are doing that, let's

484
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,880
 take a moment to say hi to the people next to you.

485
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,880
 Say hello, get to know them, introduce yourselves.

486
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
 We'll be right back.

487
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:32,880

488
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:42,880

489
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:52,880

490

 [Music]

494
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
 >> All right.

495
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,880
 Time to bring things back.

496
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,880
 There's several things that we want to keep you in the loop on.

497
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,880
 One thing that I am very excited today is bring your own lunch.

498
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
 Yes, it's happening today.

499
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
 After the service.

500
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,880
 If you don't know about it, it's okay, you go outside, get food,

501
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
 get a beverage of your choice and come bring it back and hang

502
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
 out, meet people.

503
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,880
 Also part of our culture with that too is we always want to

504
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
 talk to one or two people we don't know.

505
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
 Just connect with new people.

506
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
 Let's do that during our bring your own lunch.

507
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
 Let's talk to one or two people we don't know.

508
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
 This is part of our DNA, part of what we do.

509
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
 So that's happening at 1 o'clock following our service.

510
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
 Then we have a lunch.

511
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,880
 So that's happening at 1 o'clock following our service.

512
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,880
 Then we have alpha training coming up.

513
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
 So I'm curious, who here has ever participated in an alpha course?

514
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
 All right.

515
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
 So quite a few of you are familiar with it.

516
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,880
 So if you have enjoyed it, been blessed by that, I want to invite

517
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
 you to volunteer.

518
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
 There's different roles.

519
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,880
 You can scan a QR code and can see in what ways you can help and

520
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
 serve with that.

521
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,880
 The training for that is February 4th, 2 to 4 p.m.

522
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
 So do consider joining that.

523
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,880
 Also alpha, if you're not familiar with what alpha is, what is this

524
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
 even that you're talking about?

525
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
 Alpha is a ten-week course.

526
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
 It has basically three components.

527
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
 First, you eat together.

528
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,880
 So it's Wednesday nights, 730 to 930, starting February 21st.

529
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
 You eat a meal together.

530
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
 Then you watch a video that talks about one relevant topic, connected

531
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,880
 with the life, about importance that's important to our lives.

532
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,880
 And then you discuss it in a safe environment where you can just share

533
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
 your thoughts.

534
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,880
 And it's a great way to explore the Christian faith.

535
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,880
 So if that's something that's relevant for you, you can share it.

536
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
 And then you can also share it with your friends.

537
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,880
 So it's a great way to explore the Christian faith.

538
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,880
 So if that's something that's relevant for you, and you've maybe been

539
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,880
 wondering about what does it mean to be a Christian, I want to encourage

540
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
 you to sign up for the alpha itself.

541
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,880
 Maybe also you grew up in a Christian church, but haven't been in a church

542
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,880
 for a very long time.

543
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,880
 You haven't really thought through things as an adult or so about faith.

544
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
 Also great.

545
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,880
 I want to encourage you to sign up for that.

546
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,880
 And I want to encourage us, if you have friends that you can ask, you can

547
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,880
 pray, you can ask God to maybe highlight two people to you that you could

548
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,880
 invite that could benefit from this safe space of connecting with new people

549
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
 and of exploring Jesus.

550
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
 I want to encourage you to invite them to alpha.

551
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,880
 So we're going to be, yeah, inviting friends as well.

552
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,880
 So right now we're going to transition into a time of tithes and offerings.

553
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,880
 So welcome team, you can come up and can start passing the baskets.

554
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
 I want to just say thank you.

555
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,880
 You know, this past month there's been a lot of new people that have been

556
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
 giving, and it's been a blessing.

557
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,880
 So thank you so much for your generosity and for giving and for helping us as

558
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,880
 a church community to do this work that God is calling us to do of facilitating

559
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,880
 all of this, but also loving and serving our neighborhood.

560
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,880
 So thank you so much for your generosity in this.

561
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
 As you can see, there's different ways to give.

562
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
 There's also envelopes.

563
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,880
 They have information there.

564
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,880
 So, yeah, thank you so much for that.

565
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,880
 Now, I would love to pray with us in just a moment.

566
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,880
 I'll just wait until the buckets, you know, have passed around.

567
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,880
 Part of giving is because, you know, Jesus has been so generous to us, and he

568
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,880
 calls us his people to have his character, you know, as his followers, and

569
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,880
 there will be also people who are generous and who give towards his work

570
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
 and his things.

571
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
 So that's why we do that.

572
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,880
 But let me pray for the offering.

573
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,880
 Jesus, we thank you for all your provision, for everything that's given.

574
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,880
 And this is part of our worship, and we offer this up to you.

575
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,880
 And we pray that it would honor you and that you would use us for your purposes

576
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
 here in New Long and beyond.

577
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
 And so we pray all this in your name, Jesus.

578
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
 Amen.

579
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,880
 Amen.

580
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,880
 Well, right now I have the privilege of introducing to you, if you don't know

581
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,880
 him yet, our senior pastor, Andrew.

582
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
 So let's welcome Andrew.

583
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
 Thank you.

584
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,880
 Thank you.

585
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,880
 Yeah, so...

586
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
 I always feel so small with you.

587
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
 Get down there.

588
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
 There you go.

589
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
 All right.

590
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
 There you go.

591
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,880
 So for those of you who don't know, so Andrew is a senior pastor of the Divine

592
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,880
 Church in Wan Chai and also overseeing all of the Divine churches, including

593
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
 his church plan as well.

594
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,880
 And so he's been, of course, been dreaming about this, and it's been exciting

595
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,880
 for you to see this unfold.

596
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
 And it's great to have you.

597
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,880
 So we'd love to pray for you, for us as well, for this message.

598
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
 So let me do that.

599
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
 Thank you.

600
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,880
 You can stretch out your hands towards him, and let's pray.

601
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,880
 Jesus, thank you so much for Andrew, for his faithfulness in serving you,

602
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
 for his love for your word.

603
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,880
 I pray that you anoint him right now with your Holy Spirit as he shares this

604
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,880
 word that you've put on his heart for us here today.

605
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,880
 Also pray for us that you prepare our hearts to receive what it is that you

606
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
 want to speak to us.

607
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
 Thank you, Lord.

608
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,880
 And so we come expectantly before you, Lord, that you will meet us through this.

609
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
 I pray this in your name, Jesus.

610
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
 Amen.

611
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
 Amen.

612
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,880
 Well, good morning, everyone.

613
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,880
 It is such a deep privilege to be here.

614
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,880
 I was saying to the Cantonese service earlier today that every single week

615
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,880
 since we've launched Yinlong, I've felt like I want to be in two places at the

616
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
 same time.

617
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,880
 And Tim and I connect at the end of each Sunday, and we share kind of stories of

618
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,880
 how Wonchai was, how Yinlong was.

619
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,880
 And it is such a blessing for us to have one church in Hong Kong, but have two

620
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,880
 expressions of that church, one in Yinlong and one in Wonchai.

621
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,880
 And so I bring you greetings from everybody in Wonchai, and it is such a

622
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,880
 wonderful thing to be able to see this community growing and deepening.

623
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,880
 I see a lot of familiar faces in this room.

624
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,880
 When I've been here in the last number of times that I've been with you, but I

625
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
 see a lot of new faces in this room as well.

626
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,880
 And perhaps the Vine is a new church to you, and we are just so grateful that

627
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,880
 you're here.

628
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,880
 I really want to honor Tim and Ivan, Chapman June, and all of the people that

629
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
 are serving and the volunteers.

630
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,880
 This thing could not happen without the incredible volunteers that we have here

631
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
 in Yinlong.

632
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,880
 So thank you guys for pouring your heart and your energy into this community.

633
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,880
 And today I get to share in this series that we've been doing on Fresh

634
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,880
 Encounters, something that I feel is actually very personal to me.

635
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,880
 And one of the things that we do here at the Vine in terms of our leadership is

636
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,880
 we want to always lead or try to lead out of a place of authenticity, out of a

637
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:52,880
 place of our own brokenness, our own need for the reality of Christ in our lives,

638
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,880
 and come and serve, really, whether that's through the pulpit or through other

639
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,880
 ways that the leaders here serve, from a place of that authenticity and that

640
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
 brokenness.

641
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,880
 And much of what I want to talk about today, I think, has the ability to

642
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,880
 catalyze you into a deeper time of intimacy with Jesus than you've ever

643
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
 experienced before.

644
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,880
 But it also has the ability to hold us back.

645
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,880
 If we don't address the issue that I'm talking about today, if we don't embrace

646
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,880
 how we can use that in our lives, it actually can hold us back from entering

647
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,880
 into deeper intimacy.

648
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,880
 And as we were worshipping, I saw a picture for us as a community.

649
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,880
 And the picture was a grandfather clock, one of those old -- I'm British, by the

650
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,880
 way, in case you can't work out my accent.

651
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,880
 I am British, all right?

652
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,880
 And in the U.K., in my grandfather's house, up in the bedroom where I used to

653
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,880
 sleep when I was a kid when we would go over to my grandfather's house, he had a

654
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,880
 big grandfather's clock.

655
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,880
 And it was one of those ones that had, like, the little pendulum that swung, and

656
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,880
 it made a really loud ticking noise, you know that thing?

657
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,880
 Like, dong, dong, dong.

658
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,880
 I could not get to sleep in that bedroom at all because this thing was just

659
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,880
 swinging like this all night long and making a noise.

660
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,880
 And I felt like I was reminded of that as we were worshipping, weirdly, and I was

661
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,880
 like, what are you trying to say to us as a community?

662
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,880
 And I felt like for some of us in this room, and I know that I resonate with this

663
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,880
 as well, we sort of are constantly swinging from one thing to the next.

664
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,880
 And just like my experience in that bedroom, I could not find rest.

665
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,880
 I couldn't sleep when that thing was just ticking away like it was every night.

666
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,880
 And I feel like for some of us, we're crying out for rest.

667
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,880
 We're crying out for our soul.

668
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,880
 Not maybe even just physical rest, but a soul rest, a sense of feeling like we are

669
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,880
 connected to Jesus that enables us not to have to try, not to have to try to be

670
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,880
 something, not to have to try to constantly try to create something in our lives,

671
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,880
 but when we just relax and know that we are loved and embraced and accepted for

672
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,880
 who we are and we find great joy in just being at shalom, the biblical word,

673
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,880
 being at peace with him.

674
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,880
 Does that resonate with you?

675
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,880
 And as I unpack what I want to talk about today, I hope for some of you it will

676
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,880
 perhaps maybe help you to actually slow down a little bit and actually find your

677
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,880
 soul at rest with him.

678
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
 I want to talk about sin today.

679
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
 I know, I know.

680
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,880
 You didn't want to come to church to hear about sin today, okay?

681
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,880
 But I'm really excited about this because I think as we unpack what is perhaps one

682
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,880
 of the most central topics in scripture, I believe you're going to find great

683
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,880
 freedom today.

684
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,880
 I want to start by telling you a little story out of my own life.

685
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,880
 A number of years ago, I woke up in the morning, as we do most mornings.

686
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,880
 I woke up in the morning and I went to the bathroom and I brushed my teeth and I

687
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,880
 was washing my hands and we have a mirror, as many of us do, in our bathroom

688
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
 right in front, and I'm washing my hands and I look up in the mirror.

689
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,880
 And when we look in a mirror, we're normally seeing a reflection of

690
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,880
 ourselves and what we can see in front of ourselves.

691
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:09,880
 We very rarely, do we, very rarely check behind ourselves or anything like that.

692
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,880
 For whatever reason, I'm washing my hands that morning and I felt like I should

693
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,880
 check my back.

694
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,880
 So I kind of did this and sort of turned and looked in the mirror and I noticed

695
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,880
 that there was like a little lump in the center of my back.

696
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,880
 I'd never noticed it before.

697
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,880
 I'd never felt it before.

698
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,880
 I didn't even know it existed until that very moment.

699
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,880
 But as I was washing my hands, I just had this thought I should look at my back

700
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,880
 and I noticed this thing that was there.

701
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,880
 And my immediate thought was, "Huh, I've got a lump on my back."

702
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,880
 I didn't think anything that much about it.

703
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,880
 I was just like, "Oh, okay, I've got a lump on my back and it doesn't hurt me.

704
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,880
 I can't see it.

705
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,880
 It doesn't bother me.

706
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,880
 I don't feel it even.

707
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
 It's kind of like just one of those things.

708
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,880
 So I was just like, "Forget it.

709
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,880
 Who cares?

710
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,880
 I'll just get on with my life."

711
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,880
 Well, a number of weeks later, I was up again, washing my hands in the morning,

712
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,880
 looked in the mirror again, and the thought came, "Oh, I should have a look at

713
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,880
 that little lump again."

714
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,880
 And I had a look and now it was the size of a bit of a golf ball,

715
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,880
 like about the size of a golf ball on my back.

716
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
 Now you would think I might sort of go, "Oh, that's strange."

717
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,880
 But again, my reaction was, "Oh, that's interesting."

718
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,880
 I was like, "Okay, I've got like a lump on my back and it's grown a little bit,

719
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
 but I can't feel it.

720
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,880
 No one notices it.

721
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,880
 Even my wife hasn't said anything about it.

722
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,880
 Like no one notices it.

723
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,880
 It doesn't seem to bother anything.

724
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,880
 It doesn't hurt me.

725
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,880
 It's just like whatever."

726
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,880
 So I'm like, "Okay, fine.

727
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
 I'll just carry on with life."

728
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,880
 But about a month later, I wake up in the morning and I'm in excruciating pain.

729
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,880
 Like my back is just screaming with pain.

730
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,880
 I rushed to the mirror and I looked like this and I could not believe what I saw.

731
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,880
 Part of half of my back was just red.

732
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,880
 The little golf ball had become a baseball.

733
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,880
 It was now this big, huge, angry red mark and big, huge bump on my back.

734
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,880
 Every time I sort of turned and my muscles moved, it really hurt.

735
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,880
 And I realized, "Okay, I better actually deal with this.

736
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,880
 I better actually get this thing sorted out."

737
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,880
 So that morning, I booked myself in to a doctor that we have as a family.

738
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,880
 We went in to this doctor.

739
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,880
 I laid down on the bed and I kind of took my shirt off and I showed him.

740
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,880
 And he was like, "Oh, okay.

741
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,880
 That's pretty ugly."

742
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,880
 He put his gloves on and he kind of touched the bump on my back

743
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:22,880
 and he kind of moved it around.

744
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,880
 And he goes, "Oh, okay.

745
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,880
 It's no big deal."

746
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
 And I was like, "Great.

747
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
 It hurts."

748
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,880
 But he said, "It's no big deal."

749
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,880
 He said, "It's just a"--the technical term--"a sebaceous cyst."

750
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
 It's just a cyst.

751
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,880
 It's a bunch of kind of tissue and fat that has kind of gotten fat and congealed.

752
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
 But he's moving it around.

753
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,880
 He's like, "It's not attached to anything.

754
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,880
 It's no big deal.

755
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,880
 What we will do, we just open you up, we pop it out, we zip you back up again,

756
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
 and you're good."

757
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,880
 He said, "It takes 15 minutes."

758
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,880
 How about that?

759
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,880
 He said, "You can come and do it on your lunch break."

760
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,880
 That's like Hong Kong efficiency for you, by the way.

761
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,880
 "On your lunch break so you don't have to take any time off work.

762
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,880
 Lunch break, come in, open up, pop it out, zip you back up again,

763
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,880
 and we're good to go."

764
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,880
 He's like, "We could even do it tomorrow.

765
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,880
 What are you doing for lunch tomorrow?"

766
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,880
 And I looked at my diary.

767
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,880
 I wasn't doing anything for lunch, so I thought I would have surgery

768
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,880
 instead of just lunch.

769
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,880
 So the next day, I go back and I lie down again, and I take my top off,

770
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,880
 and there it is.

771
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,880
 It's all kind of ugly and stuff.

772
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,880
 He gets some local anesthetic.

773
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,880
 And local anesthetic, it just numbs the surface.

774
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,880
 And so he kind of injects this local anesthetic onto the lump.

775
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,880
 He opens me up, and then I hear this.

776
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,880
 I hear--now remember, I'm lying face down, facing up the floor,

777
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,880
 and I hear him go, "Oh, my gosh."

778
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,880
 Now, if you're ever in surgery, ladies and gentlemen,

779
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,880
 and you're awake, and you hear the surgeon go, "Oh, my God,

780
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,880
 that is not a good sign," okay, he goes, "Oh, my God," like this.

781
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,880
 He's kind of freaking out.

782
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,880
 I'm lying there.

783
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,880
 I'm like, "Doctor, is there a problem?"

784
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,880
 He's like, "Well," he said, "I've noticed that the cyst is actually

785
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,880
 attached to all of your back muscle.

786
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,880
 It's actually now kind of gotten attached to all of your back muscle."

787
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,880
 Now, what he should have done, if you're making notes,

788
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,880
 what he should have done at this point is sewed me back up, right,

789
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,880
 and then scheduled a proper surgery where I could have general anesthetic,

790
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,880
 get completely knocked out, and he could do whatever he wanted with my back, right?

791
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,880
 Serious surgery.

792
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,880
 He doesn't do that.

793
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,880
 He just decides to keep going.

794
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,880
 So I'm lying there, and I'm in a lot of pain,

795
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,880
 and he's injecting local anesthetic around the wound,

796
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,880
 which is not doing anything because what he's doing now

797
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,880
 is he's pulling out my back muscle, and he's cutting my back muscle

798
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,880
 so that he can free this thing and get it out of me.

799
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,880
 I cannot describe to you how excruciatingly painful it is

800
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,880
 to be completely awake and have somebody,

801
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,880
 "Ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ping," cutting your back muscle.

802
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,880
 It was no amount of local anesthetic could touch anything

803
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,880
 to the depth of what he was doing.

804
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,880
 In fact, after an hour and a half of him doing this--

805
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,880
 I'm screaming my head off, by the way.

806
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,880
 If anybody was in the waiting room, they left the doctor, right?

807
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
 Imagine if you're in the waiting room, right,

808
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,880
 and there's a closed door, and somebody's going, "Aaah!"

809
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
 I'm screaming, right?

810
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,880
 They have injected so much local anesthetic into my back

811
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,880
 that they have run out of local anesthetic.

812
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
 They no longer--he says to the nurse at one point,

813
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
 "More local anesthetic!"

814
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,880
 The nurse says, "We've run out of local anesthetic."

815
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,880
 I am crying and crying and crying, so much pain.

816
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,880
 He then goes to me--he kind of whispers in my ear--

817
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,880
 he said, "Would you like some Valium?"

818
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,880
 Now, apparently, you're not supposed to give Valium

819
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,880
 unless somebody has actually signed off on it, right?

820
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,880
 But I'm in so much pain, and he can see that I'm in so much pain.

821
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,880
 He's like, "Can I give you some Valium?"

822
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,880
 And I'm like, "Please give me Valium, yes!"

823
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,880
 So he injects some Valium into my arm.

824
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,880
 Suddenly, I'm like, "Aaah!"

825
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,880
 The swinging stopped, and I entered into Shalom.

826
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,880
 And it was like I was in heaven,

827
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,880
 and the doctor could do anything he wanted with my back at all.

828
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,880
 I'm like, "Cut away, baby. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter."

829
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,880
 I couldn't feel anything at that point.

830
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,880
 I was off in some la-la land.

831
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,880
 It took him another about 45 minutes to get the cyst out of my back.

832
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,880
 He sewed me up.

833
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,880
 I had 3 months of physiotherapy on my back--

834
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,880
 how to move my back and move my arm properly again.

835
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,880
 I mean, this was an absolute disaster.

836
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,880
 During the physiotherapy over 3 months,

837
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,880
 God began to speak to me personally out of this trauma.

838
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,880
 He said, "Andrew, you need to understand

839
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,880
 that the way that you treat your sin

840
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,880
 is exactly how you treated your cyst.

841
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,880
 You know that there's some stuff going on in your life.

842
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,880
 You know that there are a few things that are not fully aligned,

843
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,880
 but just kind of like that mirror, you're like,

844
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,880
 'Oh, yeah. Well, it's not hurting me.

845
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,880
 It's not really hurting anyone else.

846
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,880
 It's really not such a big deal. I'll just carry on.'"

847
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,880
 And God was like, "Andrew, you just walk on and carry on with your sin

848
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,880
 until it actually starts hurting yourself,

849
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,880
 until it actually does something.

850
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,880
 Maybe you get caught in something, or maybe somebody finds out,

851
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,880
 or maybe you realize that it's impacting a relationship in your life

852
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,880
 or something like that.

853
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
 Then you're willing to deal with it.

854
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,880
 But even then, you're just like the doctor.

855
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,880
 "Oh, just open it up, pop it out, zip it back up.

856
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,880
 It's no big deal. It's fine. I can handle it.

857
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,880
 It's just a minor thing. It's not a major sin. It's a minor sin."

858
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,880
 By the way, the Bible doesn't talk about sins in that way.

859
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,880
 But we so often do, "It's just a minor thing. It's not a big deal.

860
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,880
 We just don't understand fully the impact."

861
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,880
 And I felt like God was saying, "Andrew, you don't fully get it.

862
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,880
 You don't fully see that actually your sin goes so much deeper

863
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,880
 than what you just see on the surface.

864
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,880
 You see maybe anger, but you don't realize what the depth of that is

865
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,880
 and why it is that you're so angry.

866
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,880
 You see lust and some of the issues that you struggle with in that area,

867
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,880
 but you don't understand the roots of that.

868
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,880
 You think it's just an easy thing, something to quickly deal with,

869
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,880
 when actually your sin so deeply is entangled with you

870
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,880
 that no local anesthetic of you just trying to be a good Christian,

871
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,880
 of you just trying to be a better person,

872
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,880
 of you just trying to go to church more is going to solve the reality

873
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,880
 that there are some sins in your life that you're carrying around with you

874
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,880
 and you're not willing to truly deal with.

875
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,880
 You're just trying to put a band-aid on something

876
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,880
 that's going to require some valium and some uprooting

877
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,880
 at the very root of what it's entangled into.

878
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,880
 Are you with me?

879
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,880
 I'm a pastor of a church, and I think I'm a pretty good person,

880
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880
 and I do my best to walk with Jesus,

881
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:07,880
 and I realized that sin in my life had gone far deeper

882
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,880
 than perhaps it should have.

883
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,880
 And what I thought was something I could pop out and deal with in my lunch break

884
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,880
 was actually something that I needed to go on a journey with the Lord

885
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:20,880
 and to see the freedom that He truly wanted for me.

886
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,880
 It's interesting because Scripture speaks about sin this way.

887
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,880
 Let me read you this beautiful verse from Hebrews 12, verse 1.

888
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,880
 It says this, "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses,

889
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,880
 let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles."

890
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
 Notice that.

891
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,880
 "The sin that is not surface, the sin that we think is surface,

892
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,880
 and it's no big deal, but it so easily entangles in so much of us.

893
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,880
 And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us."

894
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,880
 I love the writer to Hebrews here.

895
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,880
 He's speaking to the church, and he's saying, "Church, you've got to understand

896
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,880
 that there is a great cloud of witnesses.

897
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,880
 There are men and women who through all the history have gone on a journey

898
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,880
 and walking with God, and we need to throw off everything

899
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,880
 because there is a race that God is calling us to run.

900
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,880
 There is something that God is calling you to do.

901
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,880
 There's a part of who you are that you are created and shaped and formed by God.

902
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,880
 God is doing something in your life.

903
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,880
 He's using in your workplace, in your family.

904
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,880
 There's a purpose. There's a mission.

905
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,880
 There's a race to run, and he's saying there is this race,

906
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,880
 but in order to run that race, in order to do that,

907
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,880
 you've got to throw off the things that are holding you back,

908
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,880
 the things that are weighing you down.

909
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,880
 And he says, "The sin that so easily entangles."

910
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:41,880
 The word for "entangles" here in the Greek means literally trapped, ensnared.

911
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,880
 It means hidden.

912
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,880
 "The sin that so easily is not just the surface stuff,

913
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,880
 but the stuff that is so much deeper than that."

914
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,880
 It's like the writer in Hebrews is saying, "I want to invite you on a journey,

915
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,880
 a journey where you can truly be free."

916
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,880
 When the doctor finally got my cyst out and managed to cut all the stuff

917
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,880
 that needed to be cut out, it never returned

918
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,880
 because he had dealt not just with the surface issue but with the roots.

919
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,880
 And the thing that the Holy Spirit has for us as believers in Jesus

920
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,880
 is the joy of knowing a God who truly can get to the roots,

921
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,880
 not just deal with some of the stuff that we find

922
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,880
 on the surface of our relationship with Him.

923
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
 God actually gives us a tool.

924
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,880
 He gives us a gift in order to be able to really get to the roots

925
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,880
 of our sin and our brokenness, and it's the gift of confession and repentance.

926
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,880
 And again, I know that confession and repentance seems like a really heavy topic.

927
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,880
 It seems like something that we kind of don't want to go to church to hear about that.

928
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,880
 That seems like something that's a little overwhelming.

929
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,880
 But when you think of confession and repentance,

930
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,880
 what I want you to actually be thinking about is freedom and intimacy

931
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,880
 because confession and repentance is really just a process

932
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
 of bringing freedom and intimacy into your life.

933
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,880
 And so when the Bible speaks about confession and repentance,

934
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,880
 our natural response is to often think of the negative side of that,

935
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,880
 but the Bible so often presents it more as the journey

936
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,880
 and what it brings you into.

937
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,880
 It brings you actually into a profound place of greater freedom in your life

938
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,880
 and intimacy with God.

939
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,880
 And if this whole series over January has been about fresh encounters,

940
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,880
 if your fast has been about a desire to be in deeper intimacy with Christ,

941
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,880
 then confession and repentance is perhaps the greatest tool

942
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,880
 that God has given you to bring you into a place of fresher encounter with Him.

943
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:40,880
 In fact, the writer in the book of Acts, which we know of as Luke,

944
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,880
 he writes it this way in Acts 3, starting in verse 19.

945
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,880
 He says, "Repent then and turn to God so that your sins will be wiped out

946
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,880
 and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord."

947
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,880
 Isn't that beautiful?

948
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,880
 Notice how Scripture speaks about the work of confession and repentance.

949
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
 It doesn't wrap it up in some fear.

950
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,880
 It wraps it up in joy.

951
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,880
 It says, "When we confess, when we repent,

952
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,880
 we turn from the brokenness and the bad stuff,

953
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,880
 and we find ourselves in times of refreshing with the Lord."

954
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:18,880
 In the Greek, when you read that, the emphasis is in the times of refreshing.

955
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,880
 It's like Luke is saying, "Hey, guys, this is the joy of knowing Jesus.

956
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,880
 This is actually what it's about.

957
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,880
 You want to know what intimacy is with Him?

958
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,880
 It is confessing and repenting the stuff that so easily entangles in us.

959
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,880
 It is taking seriously the fact that we walk so often in brokenness,

960
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,880
 and in releasing ourselves from that, we have times of refreshing

961
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,880
 in the presence of the Lord."

962
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,880
 It's like this great invitation into something that is far more profound

963
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,880
 than we ever realized.

964
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,880
 And the problem is that so often through the history of church,

965
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,880
 the church has talked about confession and repentance as a scary thing,

966
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,880
 as if there's some God who's super angry at us,

967
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,880
 a God who is so angry at us that He's punishing us in wrath

968
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,880
 for the broken things that we struggle with.

969
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,880
 And I think one of the things that we need to do to free ourselves as Christians

970
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,880
 is we actually need to make a shift in our mindset away from thinking

971
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,880
 about confession and repentance from a fear-based perspective,

972
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,880
 but actually think about it from a joy-based perspective.

973
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,880
 I mean, could you imagine what it would be like if we all thought

974
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,880
 that confession and repentance is a joy?

975
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,880
 Like, what a gift.

976
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,880
 What a joy it is to not have to walk around with my brokenness all the time,

977
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,880
 but to realize that Jesus went to the cross, shed His blood,

978
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,880
 so that I would be free, so that I would know times of refreshing from the Lord.

979
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,880
 So that would be the constant state that I find myself in,

980
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:46,880
 not the state of feeling guilty or shame or a state of feeling like I've got a God

981
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,880
 who's angry at me, but instead the reality is I have a God who loves me

982
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:57,880
 and, yes, sees sin, sees what sin does to me, hates sin, but loves me.

983
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,880
 And because God hates sin but loves me, when He sees that I'm in sin,

984
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,880
 what He sees is not I'm angry at this person.

985
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,880
 What God says is there's a race that I want this person to run,

986
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,880
 and if they're struggling under the yoke and the brokenness

987
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,880
 and the entanglement of this sin, they can't run as free as I want them to run.

988
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,880
 I wonder if you could sense this, that the Holy Spirit looks over you today

989
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,880
 and He says, "Man, I see so much for you.

990
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,880
 I see so much in your life.

991
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,880
 I see so much that I want to take you in and draw you into.

992
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,880
 This is the great joy of God for you.

993
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,880
 He loves you so much. He wants to release you into that."

994
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,880
 Imagine what it would be like if we came here on Sundays

995
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:46,880
 in the joy of being honest about our sin and our brokenness,

996
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,880
 knowing not that we celebrate it, not at all,

997
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,880
 but knowing that as we confess it, as we speak of it, as we recognize it,

998
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,880
 as we take ownership for it, we are releasing ourselves

999
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,880
 into the race that Christ has called us to run

1000
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,880
 and at times of refreshing of the invitation.

1001
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,880
 I love how Tim Keller puts this.

1002
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,880
 Tim Keller, one of the great pastors of our time,

1003
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,880
 unfortunately passed away recently from cancer,

1004
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,880
 but leaves behind a legacy of amazing books and teaching.

1005
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,880
 One of the great pastors in the city of New York, he wrote it this way.

1006
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,880
 He said, "Fear-based confession and repentance makes us hate ourselves.

1007
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,880
 We feel really bad, but joy-based confession and repentance makes us hate sin."

1008
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,880
 Do you see the difference?

1009
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,880
 And some of you in this room, you come in today hating yourself.

1010
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,880
 You come in feeling really bad about yourself.

1011
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,880
 You're so wallowing in guilt and shame

1012
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,880
 and you think God hates you too.

1013
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,880
 You think God is angry at you, upset at you.

1014
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:54,880
 You think God is distant from you.

1015
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,880
 And we need to shift our mentality here to realize that there is a hate at work,

1016
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
 but it's not a hate of ourselves.

1017
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,880
 It's a hate of the impact and the entanglement of sin

1018
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,880
 and the joy of knowing a Christ who can free us from that

1019
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,880
 and set us back into a new place, a place of love and joy and grace and hope.

1020
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,880
 So you need to understand that confession and repentance

1021
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,880
 is actually the truest form of worship that we have.

1022
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,880
 Because think about it.

1023
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,880
 If worship is about ascribing glory to Christ,

1024
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,880
 the greatest glory that Christ will ever do for you is to save you.

1025
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,880
 It is, in other words, to deal with the sin issue in your life.

1026
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,880
 It is to free you from sin and brokenness

1027
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,880
 and bring you back into right relationship with Christ

1028
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
 and reconcile you with Him.

1029
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,880
 And because of that, our joy of confession and repentance

1030
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,880
 is actually an act of worship.

1031
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:58,880
 It's actually a way for us to honor and to glorify what Christ has done on the cross.

1032
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,880
 And when we fail to repent and confess, when we hold on to sin,

1033
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,880
 we're actually doing the opposite.

1034
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,880
 We're not honoring the work that the cross has provided for us,

1035
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,880
 and instead we're holding on to our brokenness as if the cross hasn't happened.

1036
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,880
 But the cross has happened. You have been set free.

1037
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,880
 And what that means is that sin no longer has a grip on you.

1038
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,880
 Sin does not get the final say. Amen?

1039
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,880
 It does not get the final say in your life.

1040
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,880
 And because it no longer has the final say,

1041
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,880
 when we engage in confession and repentance,

1042
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:37,880
 we're aligning our belief to the reality that the cross is louder than sin.

1043
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,880
 Whoa, that was cool.

1044
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,880
 The cross is louder than sin.

1045
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,880
 Are you tracking with this?

1046
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,880
 I've noticed in my life as I've made the shift from thinking about repentance and confession

1047
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,880
 from a fear place, from a place of guilt and shame,

1048
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,880
 to a place of honor and joy and ultimately love,

1049
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,880
 I've noticed a lot of changes in my life.

1050
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:08,880
 I've noticed that when I'm in sin, which I am at times,

1051
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,880
 when I'm in a place of sin, before when it was fear-based,

1052
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,880
 I felt a lot of condemnation.

1053
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,880
 Now when it's joy-based, I feel a lot of conviction.

1054
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,880
 And conviction enables me to deal with that sin.

1055
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,880
 Condemnation makes me feel bad about it. Are you with me?

1056
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,880
 I've noticed when I've made the shift that before,

1057
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,880
 when I had a fear-based relationship with confession and repentance,

1058
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,880
 I noticed that I would often blame God.

1059
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,880
 Now I find myself within the joy aspect, actually wanting to align with God

1060
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:43,880
 and how He sees the reality that's happening in my life.

1061
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:49,880
 I've noticed before that I would find myself being angry at myself.

1062
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,880
 I now find myself through a joy-based confession and repentance,

1063
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,880
 finding myself humbled.

1064
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,880
 It's a different experience.

1065
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,880
 I still recognize the sin and I'm not proud of it.

1066
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,880
 But rather than feeling like I'm beating myself up about it,

1067
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,880
 I'm able to humble myself into the hands of the Lord

1068
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,880
 and ask Him to deal with what only He can deal with it,

1069
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,880
 because my local anesthetic can't touch it.

1070
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:22,880
 But His Valium, the Holy Spirit, the blood of Jesus on the cross,

1071
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,880
 can truly get to the root. Are you tracking with this?

1072
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,880
 David, one of the great psalmists, writes so beautifully of this whole process.

1073
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,880
 I want to just sit us in Psalm 32 for a little bit

1074
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,880
 as I unpack this idea a bit more with you guys.

1075
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,880
 David's an interesting man, because when we hear of David in the Old Testament,

1076
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,880
 we often think of David as this amazing guy,

1077
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
 this guy that had the idea for the temple,

1078
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,880
 a great leader who established Israel into Jerusalem.

1079
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,880
 Christ, we know, comes from the Davidic line.

1080
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,880
 Often the Scriptures talk about this Davidic dynasty,

1081
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,880
 that the Messiah would come from the house of David.

1082
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,880
 So David has a lot of sense of revere and honor in the Old Testament,

1083
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,880
 but the reality is David was a very broken man.

1084
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,880
 David was a sinner. He was a deep sinner.

1085
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,880
 He was a man who committed murder. He was a man who committed rape.

1086
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,880
 He had a lot of lust issues. He had a lot of sexual brokenness in his life.

1087
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,880
 He is not a perfect person.

1088
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,880
 And I want to encourage you that there are no perfect people in this room.

1089
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,880
 There are no perfect people here.

1090
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,880
 And the vine celebrates the beauty of the fact that none of us are perfect,

1091
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,880
 but we have a perfect Savior.

1092
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,880
 And that's the invitation we have to a God who is so good.

1093
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,880
 Now listen to how David in his brokenness, who knows God so well,

1094
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,880
 notice what he says. He says, "Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven."

1095
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,880
 That's sins. "Whose sins are forgiven, whose sins are covered.

1096
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,880
 Blessed is the one whose sins the Lord no longer counts against him

1097
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,880
 and whose spirit is no deceit." Notice how he starts.

1098
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,880
 He says, "You need to understand that you're blessed,

1099
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,880
 that you're blessed when the Lord doesn't hold any sin against you.

1100
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,880
 You're blessed when you're in a relationship with God

1101
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,880
 where he sees you through the blood of Jesus.

1102
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,880
 You're blessed because you live on this side of the cross of Calvary.

1103
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,880
 You're blessed because you have a place to bring your brokenness and bring your sin.

1104
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:10,880
 That's a place of blessing. Blessing here means flourishing.

1105
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,880
 It means life. It means abundancy. It means growth. It means goodness.

1106
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,880
 That's how David starts. He says, "You need to understand how God sees you

1107
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,880
 through the cross of Jesus. You are blessed.

1108
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,880
 Blessed are those whose sins are forgiven and your sins are forgiven because of Christ."

1109
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,880
 That's a beautiful place to start.

1110
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,880
 In other words, when we're talking about confession, repentance, and sin,

1111
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,880
 our starting point should not be, "Oh, I'm bad. I'm terrible. I'm horrible."

1112
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,880
 Our starting point should be, "I'm blessed because I have the opportunity to be redeemed.

1113
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,880
 I have the opportunity to be reconciled. I have the opportunity to be changed."

1114
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,880
 Are you with me? That's the starting point for us.

1115
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,880
 We are blessed. That doesn't mean that we don't still have sin.

1116
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,880
 It doesn't mean that we don't need to deal with some things.

1117
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:58,880
 It doesn't mean that we can't just go, "Oh, okay, whatever."

1118
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,880
 We'll get on to that in a moment.

1119
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,880
 But your starting point is you're blessed because you have an opportunity

1120
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,880
 to fully get untangled. Are you with me?

1121
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,880
 This is really important because the whole of Scripture speaks this way.

1122
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,880
 I love actually, let me just jump to 1 John.

1123
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:20,880
 Right at the end of the New Testament, 1 John puts it really quite powerfully in verse 9.

1124
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,880
 He says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive our sins

1125
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,880
 and purify us from all unrighteousness." There's the concept, "Purify us."

1126
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,880
 If we confess our sins, He is faithful to forgive.

1127
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,880
 Now, anyone in this room right now, whatever it is that you've brought in today,

1128
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,880
 no matter what's going on in your life, no matter what sin that you know you're carrying,

1129
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,880
 no matter what brokenness, no matter you know what you've done in your past,

1130
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,880
 none of that is unforgivable. Are you with me?

1131
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,880
 Every single sin that you're carrying in your heart, in your life,

1132
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,880
 anything that's ever happened, you can be cleansed from that because Christ is faithful.

1133
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,880
 He doesn't say, "I'm just going to pop it up, zip you out. It's fine."

1134
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,880
 He doesn't treat it lightly. He says, "I'm going to get into the root of it.

1135
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,880
 I am faithful and the cross has dealt with it and you can know times of refleshing.

1136
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,880
 You are blessed."

1137
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,880
 Now, this is a great joy, but David goes on to do something that's really important.

1138
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,880
 He goes on to say, "The problem we have as Christians, though,

1139
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,880
 is that even though we have this ability to confess and repent,

1140
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,880
 our issue is we very rarely do so."

1141
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:36,880
 Yeah, not the best, but it's not really hurting anyone.

1142
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,880
 Nobody knows about it. I've gotten away with it for some time.

1143
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,880
 I guess I'll just keep getting on with it.

1144
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,880
 It's very easy for us, I think, as Christians to recognize that there is this brokenness in us

1145
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,880
 and to hold on to it.

1146
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:54,880
 I want you to hear how David describes what it is to hold on to unconfessed sin.

1147
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:00,880
 Verse 3 and 4, "When I kept silent, when I just kind of went, 'Meh, no big deal,'

1148
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,880
 here's what happened.

1149
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,880
 My bones wasted away, though through my groaning all day long,

1150
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,880
 for day and night your hand was heavy upon me.

1151
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,880
 My strength was sapped as in the summer heat," or the heat of the summer.

1152
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,880
 He says, "Here's how it felt when I didn't confess, when I didn't repent,

1153
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,880
 when I realized that I'm blessed, but the problem is I held on to my sin

1154
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,880
 and I remained silent.

1155
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,880
 And here's what it felt like. It felt like my bones were wasting away."

1156
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,880
 I wonder if anybody resonates with that in this room, because I know I do.

1157
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,880
 "It felt like my bones were wasting away.

1158
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,880
 It felt like I was groaning all day long.

1159
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,880
 It felt like I had a heaviness, a yoke upon me.

1160
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,880
 It felt like I was in Hong Kong in the middle of the summer,

1161
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,880
 and it was crazy humidity, and I was wearing too many clothes,

1162
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,880
 and I'm sweaty, and I'm tired, and I'm worn out, and I just want to go home.

1163
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,880
 That's what it feels like.

1164
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,880
 When I kept silent, that was what my life was like."

1165
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,880
 And I want you to see what David is doing.

1166
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,880
 Listen to this. This is really important.

1167
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
 Here's what David's doing in this psalm.

1168
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,880
 He's setting up two true realities, the reality of being blessed,

1169
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,880
 because you have your sins forgiven, and the reality of holding on to your sins

1170
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,880
 and feeling anything other than being blessed. Are you with me?

1171
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,880
 And David is basically saying, "Choose one of those things,"

1172
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,880
 because every single human being is going to be in one of those things.

1173
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,880
 You're either blessed because you know that your sins are forgiven,

1174
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,880
 and you're finding refreshing times in the Lord,

1175
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,880
 or your bones are wasting away, and there's this groaning in you,

1176
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,880
 and a heaviness upon you, and it feels like your energy is sapped from the summer heat.

1177
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,880
 He's like, "Those are the two realities in life you can choose."

1178
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,880
 "When I kept silent, that was my choice. My bones wasted away.

1179
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:41,880
 When I confessed, something changed. Something happened."

1180
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,880
 It's very easy for us, however, to remain silent.

1181
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,880
 And here's the question we need to ask ourselves this morning.

1182
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:55,880
 Why do we as Christians, when we understand the benefits of confession and repentance,

1183
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,880
 very often remain silent?

1184
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,880
 Why is it that we don't always confess and repent?

1185
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,880
 Let me offer you a couple of quick thoughts.

1186
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:12,880
 I think one of the reasons why we don't is because we actually deny the reality of sin.

1187
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,880
 We actually just deny it.

1188
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,880
 We actually think we don't call it sin. We call it, "Ah, just a little mistake."

1189
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:25,880
 Or we look in the mirror like I did and go, "Ah, yeah. Nah. Don't need to do anything."

1190
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,880
 And we actually deny the reality of our sin.

1191
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,880
 One of the very first things we need to do is actually be honest with ourselves about what it is that we carry.

1192
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,880
 That doesn't mean it has to come with emotions of guilt and shame and wrath and anger.

1193
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,880
 It doesn't mean that we have to go there.

1194
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,880
 But we have to kind of say to ourselves, "I recognize that there is a brokenness I'm carrying."

1195
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:47,880
 "And that brokenness is not right. I recognize that it breaks the heart of God."

1196
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,880
 "I recognize that this is not what I've been created for."

1197
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,880
 "And I recognize that there's another way that I could be living."

1198
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,880
 We have to take seriously the reality of our sin.

1199
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,880
 I eventually had to deal with that thing on my back.

1200
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,880
 This is what confession is, my friends.

1201
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,880
 Confession is taking ownership of our sin.

1202
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:13,880
 You see, you cannot repent of sin until you have first confessed your sin.

1203
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:18,880
 Repentance of sin, the changing from it, and being back in right relationship with God,

1204
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,880
 only happens when we take ownership of our sin.

1205
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:26,880
 When we confess it, confession is saying, "Yeah, I recognize that there is this sin in my life."

1206
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,880
 It's actually verbalizing in our hearts or even out loud with others

1207
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,880
 that there is a brokenness that we're dealing with and we cannot deal with on our own.

1208
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,880
 You cannot have repentance of sin until there is first confession of sin.

1209
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:40,880
 Does that make sense?

1210
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,880
 And one of the reasons why I think we don't confess is we don't take that part seriously enough.

1211
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,880
 We deny the reality of our sin.

1212
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,880
 I think the second reason why we don't confess and repent sometimes

1213
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,880
 is because we fail to find true sorrow in us for our sin.

1214
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,880
 It's interesting, the word "confession" in the Greek in the New Testament

1215
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:04,880
 is actually the word homo legeo.

1216
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,880
 And homo legeo is two words broken down.

1217
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,880
 Homos means "the same," and legeo means "to speak."

1218
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,880
 And it's really interesting that the Bible would use this word to talk about the act of confession,

1219
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:23,880
 because really what it's saying is that the act of confession is to speak the same thing about sin as God does.

1220
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,880
 It is to say the same thing about sin as God does.

1221
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,880
 And here's what God says about sin.

1222
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,880
 Sin breaks relationship.

1223
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,880
 Sin breaks relationship with one another, and it breaks relationship with Him.

1224
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,880
 Sin breaks His heart, because He sees what He has created you for,

1225
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,880
 and He knows how sin holds you back from the things that He has created you for.

1226
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,880
 Those are the things that God says about sin.

1227
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,880
 He also says that Jesus has paid the price for sin.

1228
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,880
 He also says that there is a way for you to be blessed and not to be silent anymore.

1229
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,880
 He says all of that about sin.

1230
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:05,880
 So when we confess, our sorrow is aligning ourselves to say we actually agree with God that the sin is not right,

1231
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,880
 that the sin that I'm struggling with breaks His heart,

1232
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:15,880
 that the sin that I'm holding on to is my reality, when actually I could be someone who's released from that in forgiveness with Him.

1233
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:23,880
 When we confess, we are aligning our heart, our values, our voice, our mouth to the same things that God says about sin.

1234
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:24,880
 Are you with me?

1235
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:31,880
 We're not embracing all of that stuff that comes with the negative fear-based side of it.

1236
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:37,880
 We're releasing it to Him, and we're saying the same things about sin as God says,

1237
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,880
 which includes, "I love you."

1238
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:47,880
 It's actually realizing and recognizing that we are still loved despite the reality of our sin.

1239
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:54,880
 The third reason why I think we hold on to sin and we don't repent and confess is because we think we're alone in our sin.

1240
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,880
 This is a very powerful, subtle thing.

1241
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:04,880
 We come into church, and we say, "Wow, Pastor Tim. Oh, man. Pastor Tim's awesome.

1242
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,880
 Pastor Tim's great.

1243
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,880
 Pastor Tim's a perfect Christian.

1244
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,880
 Pastor Tim's a great husband, a great dad. He's a great pastor, a great preacher.

1245
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,880
 Oh, man, look at his life. I wish my life was like that.

1246
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:19,880
 He doesn't struggle with anything, but I'm struggling.

1247
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,880
 Oh, look at everybody around my row. They're all raising their hands in worship.

1248
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,880
 Oh, man, they look great. They look like they got life all sorted out.

1249
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,880
 I don't have life sorted out.

1250
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,880
 If I told somebody here that my life wasn't sorted out, but their lives are perfect, that's not going to go well.

1251
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,880
 Are you with me?

1252
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,880
 We come into a church environment, and we think we're alone in our sin.

1253
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,880
 Let me just be very honest with you.

1254
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,880
 Tim is a sinner.

1255
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,880
 I'm a sinner.

1256
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,880
 I'm your senior pastor, and I'm a sinner in need of a Savior.

1257
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,880
 There are no perfect people here.

1258
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,880
 Because that's our reality as people in Christ, that we are broken.

1259
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,880
 We are sinners in need of Him.

1260
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,880
 No one is alone in their sin in this room.

1261
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,880
 Not any of us.

1262
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,880
 We're all one family.

1263
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,880
 All one family, recognizing that we all carry stuff, and we all have to deal with stuff.

1264
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,880
 There's all individual things that are going on in our lives.

1265
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,880
 You are not alone.

1266
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:20,880
 Every time you step in here on a Sunday, you come into a family who loves you, embraces you, thinks you're awesome,

1267
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,880
 who will walk with you in the brokenness of your sin as they walk in the brokenness of theirs.

1268
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:30,880
 In fact, as we do it together, the Bible says, when we confess together, we forgive.

1269
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,880
 When He forgives us and we find healing, it's a wonderful invitation from Him.

1270
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,880
 But the fourth thing is even worse.

1271
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:42,880
 Because in the fourth thing, we think if we do share, we're going to be judged and condemned for what we share.

1272
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,880
 This is another reason why we don't share our sin.

1273
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,880
 Because we think other people are going to judge us, they're going to condemn us.

1274
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,880
 And maybe some of you in this room, that's been your experience in church.

1275
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:56,880
 Maybe you come into a church, maybe even the Vine, and you come into a church, and you felt condemned, or you felt judged for your sin.

1276
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,880
 Let me tell you, that is not the way church should be.

1277
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:00,880
 That is your experience.

1278
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,880
 Don't allow somebody else's sin to stop you from dealing with your own.

1279
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:06,880
 Are you with me?

1280
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,880
 Don't allow someone else's sin, because if you've been treated that way, that's a sinful thing.

1281
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,880
 You shouldn't have been treated that way.

1282
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,880
 Instead, you should be able to come into a church like this, in an environment like this.

1283
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,880
 And I know that Tim's heart, Ivan's heart, my heart, is to create an environment at the Vine,

1284
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,880
 where you feel accepted no matter what's going on in your life.

1285
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,880
 Where you feel loved no matter what brokenness it is that you carry.

1286
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,880
 Where you feel like the Vine is a home for you, even in the depths of the brokenness that you're trying to deal with.

1287
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,880
 You come in here, you will be loved, you will be accepted, you'll be embraced.

1288
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,880
 We will do our very best to see you as God sees you.

1289
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,880
 A sinner in need of a Savior.

1290
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,880
 Just like us.

1291
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,880
 Are you with me?

1292
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:50,880
 Now, I want you to see how then David then flips things when he begins to confess.

1293
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,880
 In verse 5 he says, "Then I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover up my iniquity anymore."

1294
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:03,880
 I said, "I will confess my sins to the Lord, and you forgive the guilt, and forgave the guilt of my sin."

1295
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,880
 Isn't that beautiful?

1296
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,880
 I confess to you, and you came and you forgave me.

1297
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:11,880
 He said, "This is awesome. I no longer covered it up anymore.

1298
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:17,880
 I welcomed myself into this relationship that I have with you, and now that I'm in that relationship, I've been set free."

1299
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,880
 It is a wonderful thing.

1300
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,880
 Some of us in this room, as we finish this 21-day fast,

1301
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,880
 and as we come into this idea that we want fresh encounters with God,

1302
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,880
 as we desire to be in deeper intimacy with Him,

1303
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:37,880
 the greatest tool available to you is just to confess and repent.

1304
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,880
 Not because you feel terrible, and you feel like you're the worst,

1305
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,880
 and you've got to try to appease an angry God,

1306
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,880
 but because you're blessed, and Christ has gone to the cross,

1307
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,880
 and in the joy that there is in knowing times of refreshment with Him,

1308
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,880
 we come and we express, we confess.

1309
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,880
 I want to finish with this.

1310
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:04,880
 Confession in Scripture is not just about confessing sin,

1311
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,880
 it's also about confessing faith.

1312
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:15,880
 In fact, we ought to confess our faith in Christ as often as we confess our sin before Christ.

1313
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,880
 Come on, church, this is really important.

1314
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:23,880
 We ought to confess our faith in Christ as much as we ought to confess our sins before Christ,

1315
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:29,880
 because our confession of faith actually creates the environment whereby we know that we can deal with our sin.

1316
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,880
 As we confess that we believe that Jesus did go to the cross,

1317
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,880
 that He did pay the price, that He was raised again,

1318
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,880
 and that the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the death raises me and is in me,

1319
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
 that I'm reconciled in my relationship with Him,

1320
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:48,880
 our confession of faith puts us in a place where we know Christ can deal with our sin.

1321
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,880
 So confession of faith actually will spur you on to confess sin more,

1322
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:58,880
 and your confession of sin will actually create the space for you to have more faith.

1323
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,880
 Come on, church, follow this. This is really important.

1324
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:02,880
 Okay, I'm going to say that one more time.

1325
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,880
 Your confession of faith, what you believe about Jesus, will open you up to confess your sin more.

1326
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:13,880
 And when you confess your sin more, you will find yourself with more faith,

1327
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,880
 which then will enable you to confess more sin.

1328
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:20,880
 And God has created this biblical circle of life together, if you will,

1329
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,880
 where confession of faith and confession of sin strengthens who you are

1330
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,880
 and strengthens our community as a church.

1331
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,880
 That's the invitation. That's joyful.

1332
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,880
 And so as you come to the end of the fast today,

1333
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,880
 and as you desire to connect more deeply with Christ this year,

1334
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,880
 I wonder whether you could shift your thinking

1335
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:50,880
 and become somebody who lives out of the joy of bringing your brokenness to Christ,

1336
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:54,880
 having short accounts with Him from a place of joy,

1337
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,880
 knowing that the work of the cross is for you and for your neighbor,

1338
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,880
 knowing that we could create something in this room

1339
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,880
 that actually has something to say to the world out there.

1340
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,880
 Could you imagine if church was actually a place

1341
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,880
 where rather than people out there going, "That's a place of judgment.

1342
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,880
 That's a place of condemnation.

1343
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,880
 That's a place where they just talk about sin and make you feel bad about yourself."

1344
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,880
 Imagine if people out there were like, "Church is a place where people love.

1345
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:26,880
 Church is a place where people feel safe.

1346
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,880
 Church is a place where people actually can deal with some of their bad habits

1347
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,880
 and some of the stuff in their life.

1348
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,880
 Church is actually a beautiful thing."

1349
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,880
 That's joy-based confession and repentance

1350
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,880
 that welcomes in everybody to knowing Christ.

1351
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,880
 I want to pray for you today that that would be your journey

1352
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,880
 and that in the discipline of confession and repentance,

1353
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:57,880
 you will find yourself intimately engaged with Him.

1354
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:01,880
 Let Him come and untangle what only He can untangle.

1355
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,880
 Can I pray for you? Let's pray.

1356
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,880
 Maybe if you're just in the quietness of your heart now,

1357
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,880
 if this has been a helpful message,

1358
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,880
 I wonder whether you just, where you are, just open your hands before the Lord.

1359
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:20,880
 That's just a symbol of saying, "I'm open to hearing from you, Jesus."

1360
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:27,880
 Father, we come now seeing all the things that David speaks of in Psalm 32,

1361
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:32,880
 knowing we're blessed and yet recognizing so often we're silent,

1362
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:38,880
 knowing that we have a God who completely and perfectly purifies His church

1363
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,880
 and yet realizing that our bones waste away so often

1364
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:46,880
 because we hold on to the brokenness that we carry.

1365
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,880
 Father, I thank You that David said, "I found myself confessing to You

1366
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:58,880
 and I experienced Your forgiveness, and I know what it is now to be set free."

1367
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,880
 Lord, I pray for every person in here,

1368
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,880
 that they would change their thinking about confession and repentance

1369
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,880
 away from an angry God who wants to smite them

1370
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:13,880
 to a loving God who is welcoming them to times of refreshing,

1371
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:18,880
 fresh encounters.

1372
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,880
 So I wonder whether you just quieten your heart before the Lord in this moment.

1373
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:30,880
 As you're sitting there with your hands open and your heart turned to Him,

1374
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:37,880
 may I invite you to start by asking Him to reveal truth to you.

1375
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:46,880
 Invite Him to speak to you about what it is that you might be carrying around with you.

1376
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,880
 What cyst, if you will, might be on your back.

1377
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:58,880
 Maybe it's been there for some time, just like it was for me.

1378
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,880
 Allow Him to show you. You might be surprised.

1379
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,880
 Maybe when you came in here you'd be like,

1380
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,880
 "This is the area God would speak to me about,"

1381
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,880
 but in this moment He shows something else to you.

1382
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,880
 I want to encourage you to trust the Holy Spirit.

1383
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,880
 Holy Spirit, would you come and speak to your children?

1384
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,880
 We love each person here so much.

1385
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,880
 You want them to run the race that you have set before them

1386
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,880
 without anything that hinders them.

1387
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,880
 And you've provided the way for them to be free.

1388
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,880
 So come, Holy Spirit, come.

1389
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:39,880
 I pray you would speak.

1390
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,880
 And as you notice the Holy Spirit showing you something,

1391
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:44,880
 the next step is just to confess that before Him.

1392
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:50,880
 As I shared earlier, to take that responsibility in your heart

1393
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,880
 and in that confession just bring it to Him.

1394
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:06,880
 To say the same thing about sin that He would.

1395
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,880
 And in that you can ask Him to forgive you

1396
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:13,880
 and to ask Him to show you that forgiveness,

1397
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,880
 that peace that surpasses our understanding,

1398
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:22,880
 that swinging pendulum of the clock to actually be still

1399
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,880
 and to find your soul at rest in Him again,

1400
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,880
 knowing that you are blessed.

1401
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:34,880
 So, Holy Spirit, I pray that you would release, Lord.

1402
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,880
 You would release the power and the joy of forgiveness over your people.

1403
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,880
 And that, Lord, this spiritual discipline of confession and repentance

1404
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:47,880
 would be something that we joyfully embrace as a community,

1405
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,880
 that we would come here on Sundays willing to be open

1406
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:52,880
 and vulnerable with one another,

1407
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,880
 that we would have the courage to ask people to pray for us,

1408
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,880
 that we would desire to keep these short accounts together,

1409
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:06,880
 to pray for one another and expect the healing that comes from that,

1410
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,880
 to be an example of the love of Christ to the world

1411
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:18,880
 and to model a new narrative in how we treat each other.

1412
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,880
 And Father, I thank you that there is great hope

1413
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:28,880
 and that intimacy is the fruit of a life of short accounts with you.

1414
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,880
 And so, Lord, I want to pray for that this week,

1415
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,880
 that as some people do some work with you,

1416
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,880
 whether in this moment or in the week ahead,

1417
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,880
 that they would find themselves stepping into that greater place of intimacy

1418
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,880
 and joy in you.

1419
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:46,880
 So just take a moment just in this time here

1420
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,880
 to just do your own walk with Christ now

1421
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,880
 as He leads you by His Spirit.

 Yes Lord, we thank you that we can come to you

1453
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,880
 and that you receive us,

1454
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,880
 that you receive us, that you have broken us,

1455
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,880
 but you don't leave us there.

1456
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,880
 You forgive us, you restore us as we confess, as we repent,

1457
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,880
 and you just pour your mercy, your grace over us.

1458
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,880
 And it is, you bring us joy and refreshing.

1459
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:45,880
 And so Lord, I ask for that, for us here,

1460
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:52,880
 that you pour out this joy and this refreshing of forgiveness

1461
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:58,880
 as we've brought to you the things that you've convicted us that are not right.

1462
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,880
 And so we pray that we can now walk in joy,

1463
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,880
 that we can walk in freedom because of what you have done.

1464
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:10,880
 We pray all this in your name, Jesus. Amen. Amen.

1465
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,880
 Well, thank you worship team for joining us.

1466

 You know, some things are powerful and we just can't pray with others.

1471
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,880
 But we have a lot of good things going on.

1472
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,880
 They would love to pray with you here on your right-hand side.

1473
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,880
 Also, parents, right now is the time to pick up your kids from K4C.
