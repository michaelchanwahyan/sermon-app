1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Amen. Well, good morning everyone. It is such a deep privilege to be here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I was saying to the Cantonese service earlier today that every single week since we've launched Yuen Long,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 I've felt like I want to be in two places at the same time.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And Tim and I connect at the end of each Sunday and we share kind of stories of how Won Chai was, how Yuen Long was.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And it is such a blessing for us to have one church in Hong Kong, but have two expressions of that church,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 one in Yuen Long and one in Won Chai. And so I bring you greetings from everybody in Won Chai.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 And it is such a wonderful thing to be able to see this community growing and deepening.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I see a lot of familiar faces in this room when I've been here in the last number of times that I've been with you,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 but I see a lot of new faces in this room as well.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And perhaps the Vine is a new church to you and we are just so grateful that you're here.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I really want to honor Tim and Ivan, Chapman June, and all of the people that are serving and the volunteers.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 This thing could not happen without the incredible volunteers that we have here in Yuen Long.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 So thank you guys for pouring your heart and your energy into this community.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And today I get to share in this series that we've been doing on Fresh Encounters,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 something that I feel is actually very personal to me.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And, you know, one of the things that we do here at the Vine in terms of our leadership is we want to always lead

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 or try to lead out of a place of authenticity, out of a place of our own brokenness,

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 our own need for the reality of Christ in our lives, and come and serve, really,

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 whether that's through the pulpit or through other ways that the leaders here serve,

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 from a place of that authenticity and that brokenness.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And much of what I want to talk about today, I think, has the ability to catalyze you

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 into a deeper time of intimacy with Jesus than you've ever experienced before.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 But it also has the ability to hold us back.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 If we don't address the issue that I'm talking about today,

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 if we don't embrace how we can use that in our lives,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 it actually can hold us back from entering into deeper intimacy.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And as we were worshipping, I saw a picture for us as a community.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And the picture was a grandfather clock, one of those old--I'm British, by the way.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 In case you can't work out my accent, I am British, all right?

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And in the UK, in my grandfather's house, up in the bedroom where I used to sleep

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 when I was a kid when we would go over to my grandfather's house,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 he had a big grandfather's clock, and it was one of those ones that had the little pendulum

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 that swung, and it made a really loud ticking noise, you know that thing?

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 That dong, dong, dong.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I could not get to sleep in that bedroom at all because this thing was just swinging

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 like this all night long and making a noise.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 And I felt like I was reminded of that as we were worshipping, weirdly,

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 and I was like, "What are you trying to say to us as a community?"

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And I felt like for some of us in this room--and I know that I resonate with this as well--

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 we sort of are constantly swinging from one thing to the next.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And just like my experience in that bedroom, I could not find rest.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I couldn't sleep when that thing was just ticking away like it was every night.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And I feel like for some of us, we're crying out for rest.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 We're crying out for our soul, not maybe even just physical rest, but a soul rest,

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 a sense of feeling like we are connected to Jesus that enables us not to have to try,

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 not to have to try to be something, not to have to try to constantly try to create something

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 in our lives, but when we just relax and know that we are loved and embraced

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 and accepted for who we are and we find great joy in just being at shalom,

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 the biblical word, being at peace with Him.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Does that resonate with you?

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And as I unpack what I want to talk about today, I hope for some of you

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 it will perhaps maybe help you to actually slow down a little bit

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 and actually find your soul at rest with Him.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I want to talk about sin today.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I know, I know.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 You didn't want to come to church to hear about sin today.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But I'm really excited about this because I think as we unpack what is perhaps

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 one of the most central topics in Scripture, I believe you're going to find great freedom today.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I want to start by telling you a little story out of my own life.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 A number of years ago, I woke up in the morning, as we do most mornings.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I woke up in the morning, and I went to the bathroom, and I brushed my teeth,

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 and I was washing my hands, and we have a mirror, as many of us do in our bathroom,

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 right in front, and I'm washing my hands, and I look up in the mirror.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And when we look in a mirror, we're normally seeing a reflection of ourselves

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 and what we can see in front of ourselves.

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 We very rarely, do we, very rarely check behind ourselves or anything like that.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 For whatever reason, I'm washing my hands that morning,

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 and I felt like I should check my back.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 So I kind of did this and sort of turned and looked in the mirror,

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 and I noticed that there was like a little lump in the center of my back.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I'd never noticed it before. I'd never felt it before.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I didn't even know it existed until that very moment.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 But as I was washing my hands, I just had this thought I should look at my back,

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 and I noticed this thing that was there, and my immediate thought was,

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 "Huh, I've got a lump on my back."

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I didn't think anything that much about it.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I was just like, "Oh, okay, I've got a lump on my back, and it doesn't hurt me.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 I can't see it. It doesn't bother me. I don't feel it even.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 It's kind of like just one of those things, so I just was like, "Forget it. Who cares?

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I'll just get on with my life."

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Well, a number of weeks later, I was up again, washing my hands in the morning,

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 looked in the mirror again, and the thought came,

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 "Oh, I should have a look at that little lump again," and I had a look,

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 and now it was the size of a bit of a golf ball,

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 like about the size of a golf ball on my back.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Now you would think I might sort of go, "Oh, that's strange,"

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 but again, my reaction was, "Oh, that's interesting."

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 I was like, "Okay, I've got a lump on my back, and it's grown a little bit,

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 but I can't feel it. No one notices it.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Even my wife hasn't said anything about it.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 No one notices it. It doesn't seem to bother anything.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It doesn't hurt me. It's just like whatever."

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So I'm like, "Okay, fine. I'll just carry on with life."

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 About a month later, I wake up in the morning, and I'm in excruciating pain.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 My back is just screaming with pain, and I rush to the mirror,

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 and I look like this, and I could not believe what I saw.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Part of half of my back was just red.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 The little golf ball had become a baseball.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 It was now this big, huge, angry red mark and big, huge bump on my back.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Every time I sort of turned and my muscles moved, it really hurt,

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 and I realized, "Okay, I better actually deal with this.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 I better actually get this thing sorted out."

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 So that morning, I booked myself in to a doctor that we have as a family.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 We went in to this doctor. I laid down on the bed,

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 and I kind of took my shirt off, and I showed him,

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 and he was like, "Oh, okay. That's pretty ugly."

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 He put his gloves on, and he kind of touched the bump on my back,

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 and he kind of moved it around, and he goes, "Oh, okay. It's no big deal."

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And I was like, "Great. It hurts." But he said, "It's no big deal."

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 He said, "It's just a"--the technical term--"a sebaceous cyst."

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 It's just a cyst. It's a bunch of tissue and fat that has kind of gotten fat and congealed,

112
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 but he's moving it around. He's like, "It's not attached to anything.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 It's no big deal. What we will do, we just open you up, we pop it out,

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 we zip you back up again, and you're good."

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 He said, "It takes 15 minutes." How about that?

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 He said, "You can come and do it on your lunch break."

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 That's like Hong Kong efficiency for you, by the way.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 "On your lunch break, so you don't have to take any time off work.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Lunch break, come in, open up, pop it out, zip you back up again, and we're good to go."

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 He's like, "We could even do it tomorrow. What are you doing for lunch tomorrow?"

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And I looked at my diary. I wasn't doing anything for lunch,

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 so I thought I would have surgery instead of just lunch.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 So the next day, I go back, and I lie down again, and I take my top off,

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 and there it is. It's all kind of ugly and stuff.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 He gets some local anesthetic, and local anesthetic, it just numbs the surface.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 So he kind of injects this local anesthetic onto the lump.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 He opens me up, and then I hear this.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 I hear, and now remember, I'm lying face down, facing up the floor,

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 and I hear him go, "Oh my gosh."

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Now, if you're ever in surgery, ladies and gentlemen, and you're awake,

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 and you hear the surgeon go, "Oh my God, that is not a good sign."

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 He goes, "Oh my God," like this. He's kind of freaking out.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I'm lying there. I'm like, "Doctor, is there a problem?"

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 He's like, "Well," he said, "I've noticed that the cyst is actually attached

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 to all of your back muscle.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 It's actually now kind of gotten attached to all of your back muscle."

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Now, what he should have done, if you're making notes,

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 what he should have done at this point is sewed me back up,

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 and then scheduled a proper surgery where I could have general anesthetic,

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 get completely knocked out, and he could do whatever he wanted with my back.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Serious surgery. He doesn't do that.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 He just decides to keep going.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 So I'm lying there, and I'm in a lot of pain,

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 and he's injecting local anesthetic around the wound,

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 which is not doing anything because what he's doing now

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 is he's pulling out my back muscle, and he's cutting my back muscle

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 so that he can free this thing and get it out of me.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 I cannot describe to you how excruciatingly painful it is

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 to be completely awake and have somebody, "Ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ping,"

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 cutting your back muscle.

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It was no amount of local anesthetic could touch anything

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 to the depth of what he was doing.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 In fact, after an hour and a half of him doing this--

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I'm screaming my head off, by the way.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 If anybody was in the waiting room, they left the doctor.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Imagine if you're in the waiting room, and there's a closed door,

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 and somebody's going, "Aaah!" I'm screaming.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 They have injected so much local anesthetic into my back

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 that they have run out of local anesthetic.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 He says to the nurse at one point, "More local anesthetic!"

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The nurse says, "We've run out of local anesthetic."

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I am crying and crying and crying, so much pain.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 He then goes to me, he kind of whispers in my ear,

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 he said, "Would you like some Valium?"

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Now, apparently you're not supposed to give Valium

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 unless somebody has actually signed off on it, right?

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 But I'm in so much pain, and he can see that I'm in so much pain.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 He's like, "Can I give you some Valium?"

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And I'm like, "Please give me Valium, yes."

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 So he injects some Valium into my arm.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Suddenly I'm like, "Aaah!"

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 The swinging stopped, and I entered into Shalom.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 And it was like I was in heaven,

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 and the doctor could do anything he wanted with my back at all.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I'm like, "Cut away, baby, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter."

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I couldn't feel anything at that point.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I was off in some la-la land.

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 It took him another about 45 minutes to get the cyst out of my back.

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He sewed me up.

180
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I had three months of physiotherapy on my back,

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 how to move my back and move my arm properly again.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 I mean, this was an absolute disaster.

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 And during the physiotherapy over three months,

184
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 God began to speak to me personally out of this trauma.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And he said, "Andrew, you need to understand

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 that the way that you treat your sin

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 is exactly how you treated your cyst.

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Like, you know that there's some stuff going on in your life.

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 You know that there are a few things that are not fully aligned,

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 but just kind of like that mirror, you're like,

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 'Oh, yeah, well, it's not hurting me.

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It's not really hurting anyone else.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 It's really not such a big deal.

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I'll just carry on.'"

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 And God was like, "Andrew, you just walk on and carry on with your sin

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 until it actually starts hurting yourself,

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 until it actually does something.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Maybe you get caught in something, or maybe somebody finds out,

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 or maybe you realize that it's impacting a relationship in your life

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 or something like that.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Then you're willing to deal with it.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But even then, you're just like the doctor.

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 "Oh, just open it up, pop it out, zip it back up.

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's no big deal. It's fine. I can handle it.

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 It's just a minor thing. It's not a major sin.

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's a minor sin."

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 By the way, the Bible doesn't talk about sins in that way.

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 But we so often do, "It's just a minor thing.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's not a big deal.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 We just don't understand fully the impact."

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And I felt like God was saying, "Andrew, you don't fully get it.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 You don't fully see that actually your sin goes so much deeper

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 than what you just see on the surface.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 You see maybe anger, but you don't realize what the depth of that is

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 and why it is that you're so angry.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 You see lust and some of the issues that you struggle with in that area,

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 but you don't understand the roots of that.

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 You think it's just an easy thing, something to quickly deal with,

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 when actually your sin so deeply is entangled with you

220
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 that no local anesthetic of you just trying to be a good Christian,

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 of you just trying to be a better person,

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 of you just trying to go to church more

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 is going to solve the reality that there are some sins in your life

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 that you're carrying around with you

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and you're not willing to truly deal with.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 You're just trying to put a Band-Aid on something

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 that's going to require some Valium and some uprooting

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 at the very root of what it's entangled into.

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Are you with me?

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I'm a pastor of a church, and I think I'm a pretty good person.

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I do my best to walk with Jesus,

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 and I realized that sin in my life had gone far deeper

233
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 than perhaps it should have.

234
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 What I thought was something I could pop out and deal with in my lunch break

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 was actually something that I needed to go on a journey with the Lord

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 and to see the freedom that He truly wanted for me.

237
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 It's interesting because Scripture speaks about sin this way.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Let me read you this beautiful verse from Hebrews 12, verse 1.

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 It says this, "Therefore, since we are surrounded

240
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 by such a great cloud of witnesses,

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 let us throw off everything that hinders

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 and the sin that so easily entangles."

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Notice that.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 "The sin that is not surface,

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 the sin that we think is surface, and it's no big deal,

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 but it so easily entangles in so much of us.

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us."

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I love the writer to Hebrews here.

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 He's speaking to the church, and he's saying,

250
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 "Church, you've got to understand that there is a great cloud of witnesses.

251
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 There are men and women who through all the history

252
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 have gone on a journey and walking with God,

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 and we need to throw off everything

254
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 because there is a race that God is calling us to run.

255
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 There is something that God is calling you to do.

256
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 There's a part of who you are that you are created and shaped and formed by God.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 God is doing something in your life.

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 He's using your workplace and your family.

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 There's a purpose. There's a mission.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 There's a race to run."

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And he's saying, "There is this race, but in order to run that race,

262
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 in order to do that, you've got to throw off the things that are holding you back,

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 the things that are weighing you down."

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And he says, "The sin that so easily entangles."

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 The word for "entangles" here in the Greek means literally trapped, ensnared.

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 It means hidden.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 "The sin that so easily is not just the surface stuff,

268
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 but the stuff that is so much deeper than that."

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 It's like the writer in Hebrews is saying, "I want to invite you on a journey,

270
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 a journey where you can truly be free."

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 When the doctor finally got my cyst out

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 and managed to cut all the stuff that needed to be cut out,

273
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 it never returned because he had dealt not just with the surface issue

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 but with the roots.

275
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 The thing that the Holy Spirit has for us as believers in Jesus

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 is the joy of knowing a God who truly can get to the roots,

277
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 not just deal with some of the stuff that we find

278
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 on the surface of our relationship with Him.

279
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 God actually gives us a tool, He gives us a gift

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 in order to be able to really get to the roots of our sin and our brokenness.

281
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And it's the gift of confession and repentance.

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And again, I know that confession and repentance seems like a really heavy topic.

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 It seems like something that we kind of don't want to go to church to hear about.

284
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 That seems like something that's a little overwhelming.

285
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 But when you think of confession and repentance,

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 what I want you to actually be thinking about is freedom and intimacy.

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Because confession and repentance is really just a process

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 of bringing freedom and intimacy into your life.

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And so when the Bible speaks about confession and repentance,

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 our natural response is to often think of the negative side of that.

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 But the Bible so often presents it more as the journey

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 and what it brings you into.

293
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 It brings you actually into a profound place of greater freedom in your life

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 and intimacy with God.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And if this whole series over January has been about fresh encounters,

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 if your fast has been about a desire to be in deeper intimacy with Christ,

297
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 then confession and repentance is perhaps the greatest tool

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 that God has given you to bring you into a place of fresher encounter with Him.

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 In fact, the writer in the book of Acts, which we know of as Luke,

300
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 he writes it this way in Acts 3, starting in verse 19.

301
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 He says, "Repent then and turn to God so that your sins will be wiped out

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord."

303
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Isn't that beautiful?

304
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Notice how Scripture speaks about the work of confession and repentance.

305
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 It doesn't wrap it up in some fear.

306
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 It wraps it up in joy.

307
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 It says, "When we confess, when we repent,

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 we turn from the brokenness and the bad stuff,

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 and we find ourselves in times of refreshing with the Lord."

310
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 In the Greek, when you read that, the emphasis is in the times of refreshing.

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 It's like Luke is saying, "Hey, guys, this is the joy of knowing Jesus.

312
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 This is actually what it's about.

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 You want to know what intimacy is with Him?

314
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 It is confessing and repenting the stuff that so easily entangles in us.

315
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It is taking seriously the fact that we walk so often in brokenness,

316
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 and in releasing ourselves from that, we have times of refreshing

317
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 in the presence of the Lord."

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 It's like this great invitation into something that is far more profound

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 than we ever realized.

320
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 And the problem is that so often through the history of church,

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 the church has talked about confession and repentance as a scary thing,

322
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 as if there's some God who's super angry at us,

323
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 a God who is so angry at us that He's punishing us in wrath

324
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 for the broken things that we struggle with.

325
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And I think one of the things that we need to do to free ourselves as Christians

326
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 is we actually need to make a shift in our mindset away from thinking

327
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 about confession and repentance from a fear-based perspective,

328
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 but actually think about it from a joy-based perspective.

329
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I mean, could you imagine what it would be like if we all thought

330
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 that confession and repentance is a joy?

331
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Like, what a gift.

332
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 What a joy it is to not have to walk around with my brokenness all the time,

333
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 but to realize that Jesus went to the cross, shed His blood,

334
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 so that I would be free, so that I would know times of refreshing from the Lord.

335
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 So that would be the constant state that I find myself in,

336
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 not the state of feeling guilty or shame or a state of feeling like I've got a God

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 who's angry at me, but instead the reality is I have a God who loves me

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 and, yes, sees sin, sees what sin does to me, hates sin, but loves me.

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And because God hates sin but loves me, when He sees that I'm in sin,

340
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 what He sees is not I'm angry at this person.

341
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 What God says is there's a race that I want this person to run,

342
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 and if they're struggling under the yoke and the brokenness

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 and the entanglement of this sin, they can't run as free as I want them to run.

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I wonder if you could sense this, that the Holy Spirit looks over you today,

345
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 and He says, "Man, I see so much for you.

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I see so much in your life.

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I see so much that I want to take you in and draw you into.

348
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 This is the great joy of God for you.

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 He loves you so much. He wants to release you into that."

350
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Imagine what it would be like if we came here on Sundays

351
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 in the joy of being honest about our sin and our brokenness,

352
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 knowing not that we celebrate it, not at all,

353
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 but knowing that as we confess it, as we speak of it,

354
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 as we recognize it, as we take ownership for it,

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 we are releasing ourselves into the race that Christ has called us to run

356
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 and at times of refreshing of the invitation.

357
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 I love how Tim Keller puts this.

358
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Tim Keller, one of the great pastors of our time,

359
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 unfortunately passed away recently from cancer,

360
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 but leaves behind a legacy of amazing books and teaching.

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 One of the great pastors in the city of New York,

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 he wrote it this way.

363
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 He said, "Fear-based confession and repentance makes us hate ourselves.

364
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 We feel really bad, but joy-based confession and repentance makes us hate sin."

365
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Do you see the difference?

366
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Some of you in this room, you come in today hating yourself.

367
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 You come in feeling really bad about yourself.

368
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 You're so wallowing in guilt and shame, and you think God hates you too.

369
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 You think God is angry at you, upset at you.

370
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 You think God is distant from you.

371
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And we need to shift our mentality here to realize that there is a hate at work,

372
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 but it's not a hate of ourselves.

373
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It's a hate of the impact and the entanglement of sin

374
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 and the joy of knowing a Christ who can free us from that

375
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 and set us back into a new place, a place of love and joy and grace and hope.

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So you need to understand that confession and repentance

377
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 is actually the truest form of worship that we have.

378
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Because think about it.

379
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 If worship is about ascribing glory to Christ,

380
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 the greatest glory that Christ will ever do for you is to save you.

381
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It is, in other words, to deal with the sin issue in your life.

382
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It is to free you from sin and brokenness

383
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 and bring you back into right relationship with Christ

384
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 and reconcile you with Him.

385
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And because of that, our joy of confession and repentance

386
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 is actually an act of worship.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 It's actually a way for us to honor and to glorify what Christ has done on the cross.

388
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And when we fail to repent and confess, when we hold on to sin,

389
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 we're actually doing the opposite.

390
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 We're not honoring the work that the cross has provided for us,

391
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 and instead we're holding on to our brokenness as if the cross hasn't happened.

392
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 But the cross has happened. You have been set free.

393
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And what that means is that sin no longer has a grip on you.

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Sin does not get the final say. Amen?

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It does not get the final say in your life.

396
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And because it no longer has the final say,

397
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 when we engage in confession and repentance,

398
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 we're aligning our belief to the reality that the cross is louder than sin.

399
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Whoa, that was cool.

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 The cross is louder than sin.

401
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Are you tracking with this?

402
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I've noticed in my life as I've made the shift from thinking about repentance and confession

403
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 from a fear place, from a place of guilt and shame,

404
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 to a place of honor and joy and ultimately love,

405
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I've noticed a lot of changes in my life.

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I've noticed that when I'm in sin, which I am at times,

407
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 when I'm in a place of sin, before when it was fear-based,

408
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 I felt a lot of condemnation.

409
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Now when it's joy-based, I feel a lot of conviction.

410
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And conviction enables me to deal with that sin.

411
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Condemnation makes me feel bad about it. Are you with me?

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 I've noticed when I've made the shift that before when I had a fear-based relationship

413
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 with confession and repentance, I noticed that I would often blame God.

414
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Now I find myself within the joy aspect, actually wanting to align with God

415
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 and how He sees the reality that's happening in my life.

416
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 I've noticed before that I would find myself being angry at myself.

417
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I now find myself through a joy-based confession and repentance,

418
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 finding myself humbled. It's a different experience.

419
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I still recognize the sin and I'm not proud of it.

420
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 But rather than feeling like I'm beating myself up about it,

421
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I'm able to humble myself into the hands of the Lord

422
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 and ask Him to deal with what only He can do with it

423
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 because my local anesthetic can't touch it.

424
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But His Valium, the Holy Spirit, the blood of Jesus on the cross

425
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 can truly get to the root. Are you tracking with this?

426
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 David, one of the great psalmists, writes so beautifully of this whole process.

427
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I want to just sit us in Psalm 32 for a little bit

428
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 as I unpack this idea a bit more with you guys.

429
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 David's an interesting man because when we hear of David in the Old Testament,

430
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 we often think of David as this amazing guy, this guy that had the idea for the temple,

431
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 a great leader who established Israel into Jerusalem.

432
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Christ, we know, comes from the Davidic line.

433
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Often the Scriptures talk about this Davidic dynasty,

434
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 that the Messiah would come from the house of David.

435
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 So David has a lot of sense of revere and honor in the Old Testament,

436
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 but the reality is David was a very broken man.

437
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 David was a sinner. He was a deep sinner.

438
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 He was a man who committed murder. He was a man who committed rape.

439
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 He had a lot of lust issues. He had a lot of sexual brokenness in his life.

440
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 He is not a perfect person.

441
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And I want to encourage you that there are no perfect people in this room.

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 There are no perfect people here.

443
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And the vine celebrates the beauty of the fact that none of us are perfect,

444
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 but we have a perfect Savior.

445
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And that's the invitation we have to a God who is so good.

446
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Now listen to how David in his brokenness, who knows God so well,

447
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 notice what he says. He says, "Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven."

448
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 That's sins. "Whose sins are forgiven, whose sins are covered.

449
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Blessed is the one whose sins the Lord no longer counts against him

450
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 and whose spirit is no deceit." Notice how he starts.

451
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 He says, "You need to understand that you're blessed,

452
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 that you're blessed when the Lord doesn't hold any sin against you.

453
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 You're blessed when you're in a relationship with God

454
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 where he sees you through the blood of Jesus.

455
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 You're blessed because you live on this side of the cross of Calvary.

456
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 You're blessed because you have a place to bring your brokenness and bring your sin.

457
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 That's a place of blessing. Blessing here means flourishing.

458
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 It means life. It means abundancy. It means growth. It means goodness.

459
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 That's how David starts.

460
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 He says, "You need to understand how God sees you through the cross of Jesus.

461
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 You are blessed. Blessed are those whose sins are forgiven

462
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 and your sins are forgiven because of Christ."

463
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 That's a beautiful place to start.

464
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 In other words, when we're talking about confession, repentance, and sin,

465
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 our starting point should not be, "Oh, I'm bad. I'm terrible. I'm horrible."

466
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Our starting place should be, "I'm blessed because I have the opportunity to be redeemed.

467
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I have the opportunity to be reconciled. I have the opportunity to be changed."

468
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Are you with me?

469
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 That's the starting point for us is that we are blessed.

470
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 That doesn't mean that we don't still have sin.

471
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 It doesn't mean that we don't need to deal with some things.

472
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 It doesn't mean that we can't just go, "Oh, okay, whatever."

473
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 We'll get on to that in a moment.

474
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 But your starting point is you're blessed because you have an opportunity to fully get untangled.

475
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Are you with me?

476
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 This is really important because the whole of Scripture speaks this way.

477
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Let me just jump to 1 John right at the end of the New Testament.

478
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 1 John puts it really quite powerfully in verse 9.

479
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 He says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."

480
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 There's the concept, "Purify us."

481
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 "If we confess our sins, He is faithful to forgive."

482
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Now, anyone in this room right now, whatever it is that you've brought in today,

483
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 no matter what's going on in your life, no matter what sin that you know you're carrying,

484
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 no matter what brokenness, no matter what you've done in your past,

485
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 none of that is unforgivable.

486
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Are you with me?

487
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Every single sin that you're carrying in your heart, in your life, anything that's ever happened,

488
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 you can be cleansed from that because Christ is faithful.

489
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 He doesn't say, "I'm just going to pop it up, zip you out. It's fine."

490
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He doesn't treat it lightly.

491
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 He says, "I'm going to get into the root of it. I am faithful, and the cross has dealt with it,

492
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and you can know times of refleshing. You are blessed."

493
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Now, this is a great joy, but David goes on to do something that's really important.

494
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 He goes on to say, "The problem we have as Christians, though,

495
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 is that even though we have this ability to confess and repent,

496
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 our issue is we very rarely do so."

497
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 "Ah, yeah, not the best, but it's not really hurting anyone.

498
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Nobody knows about it. I've gotten away with it for some time.

499
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I guess I'll just keep getting on with it."

500
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 It's very easy for us, I think, as Christians to recognize that there is this brokenness in us

501
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 and to hold on to it.

502
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 I want you to hear how David describes what it is to hold on to unconfessed sin.

503
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 Verse 3 and 4, "When I kept silent, when I just kind of went, 'Meh, no big deal,' here's what happened.

504
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 My bones wasted away, though through my groaning all day long,

505
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 for day and night your hand was heavy upon me.

506
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 My strength was sapped as in the summer heat," or the heat of the summer.

507
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 He says, "Here's how it felt when I didn't confess, when I didn't repent,

508
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 when I realized that I'm blessed, but the problem is I held on to my sin and I remained silent.

509
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 And here's what it felt like. It felt like my bones were wasting away."

510
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 I wonder if anybody resonates with that in this room, because I know I do.

511
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "It felt like my bones were wasting away. It felt like I was groaning all day long.

512
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 It felt like I had a heaviness, a yoke upon me.

513
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 It felt like I was in Hong Kong in the middle of the summer, and it was crazy humidity,

514
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 and I was wearing too many clothes, and I'm sweaty, and I'm tired, and I'm worn out, and I just want to go home.

515
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 That's what it feels like. When I kept silent, that was what my life was like."

516
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And I want you to see what David is doing. Listen to this. This is really important.

517
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Here's what David's doing in this psalm. He's setting up two true realities.

518
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 The reality of being blessed, because you have your sins forgiven,

519
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 and the reality of holding on to your sins and feeling anything other than being blessed.

520
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Are you with me? And David is basically saying, "Choose one of those things,

521
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 because every single human being is going to be in one of those things."

522
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 You're either blessed because you know that your sins are forgiven,

523
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 and you're finding refreshing times in the Lord, or your bones are wasting away,

524
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 and there's this groaning in you, and a heaviness upon you,

525
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 and it feels like your energy is sapped from the summer heat.

526
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 He's like, "Those are the two realities in life you can choose."

527
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 "When I kept silent," that was my choice, "my bones wasted away.

528
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 When I confessed, something changed. Something happened."

529
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 It's very easy for us, however, to remain silent.

530
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And here's the question we need to ask ourselves this morning.

531
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Why do we as Christians, when we understand the benefits of confession and repentance,

532
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 very often remain silent?

533
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Why is it that we don't always confess and repent?

534
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Let me offer you a couple of quick thoughts.

535
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 I think one of the reasons why we don't is because we actually deny the reality of sin.

536
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 We actually just deny it. We actually think--we don't call it sin.

537
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 We call it, "Ah, just a little mistake."

538
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Or we look in the mirror like I did and go like, "Ah, yeah. Nah. Don't need to do anything."

539
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And we actually deny the reality of our sin, and one of the very first things we need to do

540
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 is actually be honest with ourselves about what it is that we carry.

541
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 That doesn't mean it has to come with emotions of guilt and shame and wrath and anger.

542
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 It doesn't mean that we have to go there, but we have to kind of say to ourselves,

543
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 "I recognize that there is a brokenness I'm carrying, and that brokenness is not right.

544
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I recognize that it breaks the heart of God.

545
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I recognize that this is not what I've been created for,

546
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 and I recognize that there is another way that I could be living."

547
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 We have to take seriously the reality of our sin.

548
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 I eventually had to deal with that thing on my back.

549
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 This is what confession is, my friends.

550
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 Confession is taking ownership of our sin.

551
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 You see, you cannot repent of sin until you have first confessed your sin.

552
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Repentance of sin, the changing from it and being back in right relationship with God

553
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 only happens when we take ownership of our sin, when we confess it.

554
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Confession is saying, "Yeah, I recognize that there is this sin in my life."

555
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 It's actually verbalizing in our hearts or even out loud with others

556
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 that there is a brokenness that we're dealing with, and we cannot deal with it on our own.

557
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 You cannot have repentance of sin until there is first confession of sin.

558
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Does that make sense?

559
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 One of the reasons why I think we don't confess is we don't take that part seriously enough.

560
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 We deny the reality of our sin.

561
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 I think the second reason why we don't confess and repent sometimes

562
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 is because we fail to find true sorrow in us for our sin.

563
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 It's interesting, the word confession in the Greek in the New Testament

564
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 is actually the word homo legeo.

565
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And homo legeo is two words broken down.

566
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 Homos means the same, and legeo means to speak.

567
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And it's really interesting that the Bible would use this word to talk about the act of confession.

568
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Because really what it's saying is that the act of confession

569
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 is to speak the same thing about sin as God does.

570
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 It is to say the same thing about sin as God does.

571
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And here's what God says about sin.

572
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Sin breaks relationship.

573
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Sin breaks relationship with one another, and it breaks relationship with Him.

574
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Sin breaks His heart, because He sees what He has created you for,

575
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 and He knows how sin holds you back from the things that He has created you for.

576
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Those are the things that God says about sin.

577
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 He also says that Jesus has paid the price for sin.

578
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 He also says that there is a way for you to be blessed and not to be silent anymore.

579
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 He says all of that about sin.

580
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 So when we confess, our sorrow is aligning ourself to say we actually agree with God

581
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 that the sin is not right, that the sin that I'm struggling with breaks His heart,

582
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 that the sin that I'm holding onto is my reality,

583
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 when actually I could be someone who's released from that and forgiven us with Him.

584
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 When we confess, we are aligning our heart, our values, our voice, our mouth

585
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 to the same things that God says about sin.

586
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Are you with me?

587
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 We're not embracing all of that stuff that comes with the negative fear-based side of it.

588
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 We're releasing it to Him, and we're saying the same things about sin as God says,

589
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 which includes, "I love you."

590
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 It's actually realizing and recognizing that we are still loved

591
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 despite the reality of our sin.

592
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 The third reason why I think we hold onto sin and we don't repent and confess

593
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 is because we think we're alone in our sin.

594
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 This is a very powerful, subtle thing.

595
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 We come into church, and we say, "Wow, Pastor Tim. Oh, man.

596
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Pastor Tim's awesome. Pastor Tim's great.

597
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Pastor Tim's a perfect Christian.

598
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Pastor Tim's a great husband, a great dad. He's a great pastor, a great preacher.

599
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Oh, man, look at his life. I wish my life was like that.

600
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 He doesn't struggle with anything, but I'm struggling.

601
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Oh, look at everybody around my row. They're all raising their hands in worship.

602
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Oh, man, they look great. They look like they got life all sorted out.

603
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 I don't have life sorted out.

604
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And if I told somebody here that my life wasn't sorted out, but their lives are perfect,

605
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 that's not going to go well. Are you with me?

606
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 We come into a church environment, and we think we're alone in our sin.

607
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Let me just be very honest with you.

608
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Tim is a sinner. I'm a sinner.

609
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 I'm your senior pastor, and I'm a sinner in need of a Savior.

610
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 There are no perfect people here.

611
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Because that's our reality as people in Christ, that we are broken.

612
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 We are sinners in need of Him.

613
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 No one is alone in their sin in this room.

614
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Not any of us. We're all one family.

615
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 All one family recognizing that we all carry stuff, and we all have to deal with stuff,

616
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 and there's all individual things that are going on in our lives.

617
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 You are not alone.

618
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And every time you step in here on a Sunday, you come into a family who loves you,

619
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 embraces you, thinks you're awesome,

620
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 who will walk with you in the brokenness of your sin

621
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 as they walk in the brokenness of theirs.

622
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 And in fact, as we do it together, the Bible says, when we confess together, we forgive.

623
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Christ forgives us, and we find healing.

624
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 It's a wonderful invitation from Him.

625
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 But the fourth thing is even worse.

626
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Because in the fourth thing, we think if we do share,

627
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 we're going to be judged and condemned for what we share.

628
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 This is another reason why we don't share our sin.

629
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 Because we think other people are going to judge us, they're going to condemn us.

630
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 And maybe some of you in this room, that's been your experience in church.

631
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Maybe you come into a church, maybe even the Vine,

632
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 and you come into a church, and you felt condemned, or you felt judged for your sin.

633
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Let me tell you, that is not the way church should be.

634
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And if that is your experience, don't allow somebody else's sin

635
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 to stop you from dealing with your own.

636
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Are you with me?

637
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Don't allow someone else's sin, because if you've been treated that way,

638
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 that's a sinful thing. You shouldn't have been treated that way.

639
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Instead, you should be able to come into a church like this,

640
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 in an environment like this.

641
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 And I know that Tim's heart, Ivan's heart, my heart,

642
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 is to create an environment at the Vine, where you feel accepted,

643
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 no matter what's going on in your life.

644
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Where you feel loved, no matter what brokenness it is that you carry.

645
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Where you feel like the Vine is a home for you,

646
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 even in the depths of the brokenness that you're trying to deal with.

647
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 You come in here, you will be loved, you will be accepted, you'll be embraced.

648
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 We will do our very best to see you as God sees you.

649
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 A sinner in need of a Savior, just like us.

650
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Are you with me?

651
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Now, I want you to see how then David then flips things

652
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 when he begins to confess.

653
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 In verse 5, he says, "Then I acknowledged my sin to you,

654
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 and I did not cover up my iniquity anymore.

655
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 I said, 'I will confess my sins to the Lord,

656
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 and you forgive the guilt, and forgave the guilt of my sin.'"

657
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Isn't that beautiful?

658
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 "I confess to you, and you came and you forgave me."

659
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 He said, "This is awesome. I no longer covered it up anymore.

660
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 I welcomed myself into this relationship that I have with you,

661
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 and now that I'm in that relationship, I've been set free."

662
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 It is a wonderful thing.

663
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And some of us in this room, as we finish this 21-day fast,

664
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 and as we come into this idea that we want fresh encounters with God,

665
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 as we desire to be in deeper intimacy with Him,

666
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 the greatest tool available to you is just to confess and repent,

667
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 not because you feel terrible, and you feel like you're the worst,

668
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 and you've got to try to appease an angry God,

669
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 but because you're blessed, and Christ has gone to the cross,

670
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 and in the joy that there is in knowing times of refreshment with Him,

671
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 we come and we express, we confess.

672
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 And I want to finish with this.

673
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 Confession in Scripture is not just about confessing sin,

674
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 it's also about confessing faith.

675
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 In fact, we ought to confess our faith in Christ

676
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 as often as we confess our sin before Christ.

677
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Come on, church, this is really important.

678
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 We ought to confess our faith in Christ

679
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 as much as we are to confess our sins before Christ,

680
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 because our confession of faith actually creates the environment

681
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 whereby we know that we can deal with our sin.

682
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 As we confess that we believe that Jesus did go to the cross,

683
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 that He did pay the price, that He was raised again,

684
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 and that the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the death

685
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 raises me and is in me,

686
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 that I'm reconciled in my relationship with Him,

687
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 our confession of faith puts us in a place

688
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 where we know Christ can deal with our sin.

689
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 So confession of faith actually will spur you on to confess sin more.

690
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 And your confession of sin will actually create the space for you

691
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 to have more faith.

692
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Come on, church, follow this. This is really important.

693
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Okay, I'm going to say that one more time.

694
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Your confession of faith, what you believe about Jesus,

695
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 will open you up to confess your sin more.

696
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 And when you confess your sin more,

697
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 you will find yourself with more faith,

698
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 which then will enable you to confess more sin.

699
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 And God has created this biblical circle of life together, if you will,

700
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 where confession of faith and confession of sin

701
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 strengthens who you are and strengthens our community as a church.

702
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 That's the invitation.

703
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 That's joyful.

704
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 And so as you come to the end of the fast today,

705
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 and as you desire to connect more deeply with Christ this year,

706
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 I wonder whether you could shift your thinking.

707
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 And become somebody who lives out of the joy of bringing your brokenness to Christ.

708
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Having short accounts with Him from a place of joy,

709
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 knowing that the work of the cross is for you and for your neighbor.

710
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Knowing that we could create something in this room

711
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 that actually has something to say to the world out there.

712
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Could you imagine if church was actually a place

713
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 where rather than people out there going,

714
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 "That's a place of judgment. That's a place of condemnation.

715
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 That's a place where they just talk about sin and make you feel bad about yourself."

716
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 Imagine if people out there were like,

717
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 "Church is a place where people love.

718
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Church is a place where people feel safe.

719
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Church is a place where people actually can deal with some of their bad habits

720
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 and some of the stuff in their life.

721
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Church is actually a beautiful thing."

722
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 That's joy-based confession and repentance

723
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 that welcomes in everybody to knowing Christ.

724
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 I want to pray for you today that that would be your journey.

725
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 And that in the discipline of confession and repentance,

726
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 you will find yourself intimately engaged with Him.

727
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Let Him come and untangle what only He can untangle.

728
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Can I pray for you? Let's pray.

729
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Maybe if you're just in the quietness of your heart now,

730
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 if this has been a helpful message,

731
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 I wonder whether you just, where you are, just open your hands before the Lord.

732
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 That's just a symbol of saying, "I'm open to hearing from you, Jesus."

733
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 And Father, we come now seeing all the things that David speaks of in Psalm 32,

734
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 knowing we're blessed and yet recognizing so often we're silent,

735
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 knowing that we have a God who completely and perfectly purifies His church

736
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 and yet realizing that our bones waste away so often

737
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 because we hold on to the brokenness that we carry.

738
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 Father, I thank you that David said, "I found myself confessing to you,

739
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 and I experienced your forgiveness, and I know what it is now to be set free."

740
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Lord, I pray for every person in here

741
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 that they would change their thinking about confession and repentance

742
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 away from an angry God who wants to smite them

743
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 to a loving God who is welcoming them to times of refreshing, fresh encounters.

744
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 So I wonder whether you just quieten your heart before the Lord in this moment.

745
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 As you're sitting there with your hands open and your heart turned to Him,

746
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 may I invite you to start by asking Him to reveal truth to you.

747
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Invite Him to speak to you about what it is that you might be carrying around with you.

748
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 What cyst, if you will, might be on your back.

749
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 Maybe it's been there for some time, just like it was for me.

750
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 Allow Him to show you. You might be surprised.

751
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Maybe when you came in here, you'd be like, "This is the area God would speak to me about,"

752
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 but in this moment, He shows something else to you.

753
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 I want to encourage you to trust the Holy Spirit.

754
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Holy Spirit, would you come and speak to your children?

755
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 We love each person here so much.

756
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 You want them to run the race that you have set before them

757
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 without anything that hinders them.

758
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 You've provided the way for them to be free.

759
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 So come, Holy Spirit, come.

760
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 I pray you would speak.

761
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 As you notice the Holy Spirit showing you something,

762
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 the next step is just to confess that before Him.

763
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 As I shared earlier, to take that responsibility in your heart

764
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 and in that confession, just bring it to Him.

765
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 To say the same thing about sin that He would.

766
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 And in that, you can ask Him to forgive you

767
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 and to ask Him to show you that forgiveness,

768
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 that peace that surpasses our understanding,

769
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 that swinging pendulum of the clock to actually be still

770
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 and to find your soul at rest in Him again,

771
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 knowing that you are blessed.

772
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 So, Holy Spirit, I pray that you would release, Lord.

773
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 You would release the power and the joy of forgiveness over your people.

774
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
 And that, Lord, this spiritual discipline of confession and repentance

775
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 may that we joyfully embrace as a community.

776
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 That we would come here on Sundays willing to be open and vulnerable with one another.

777
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 That we would have the courage to ask people to pray for us.

778
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 That we would desire to keep these short accounts together,

779
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 to pray for one another and expect the healing that comes from that.

780
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 To be an example of the love of Christ to the world

781
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 and to model a new narrative in how we treat each other.

782
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 And Father, I thank you that there is great hope

783
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 and that intimacy is the fruit of a life of short accounts with you.

784
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 And so, Lord, I want to pray for that this week,

785
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 that as some people do some work with you,

786
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 whether in this moment or in the week ahead,

787
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 that they would find themselves stepping into that greater place of intimacy

788
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 and joy in you.

789
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 So just take a moment just in this time here

790
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 to just do your own walk with Christ now

791
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 as he leads you by his Spirit.
