1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 delivers it now, in Jesus' name, amen.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,420
 - Amen, thanks.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,560
 Good morning, everybody.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,400
 Oh, full, okay.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,020
 Today's gonna be fun.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,820
 We're gonna be going through the parables again.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,240
 This is week two.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,660
 And just a bit of a reminder,

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,840
 kind of a recap for all of us to get back on the same page,

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,820
 'cause I sometimes talk too fast,

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,900
 and I don't want anyone to get lost,

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,020
 so let me just kind of lay out what we're doing.

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,820
 Picking up in the parables, we're gonna remember

14
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,060
 and recall the idea that the purpose of parables,

15
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,800
 pretty simple, there's these big, profound truths

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,840
 about the kingdom of God, about the kingdom of heaven,

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,520
 about the Father, that can be challenging

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,100
 for us to fully grasp.

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,580
 So Jesus, knowing that, provided these parables,

20
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,620
 ways for us to be able to understand,

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,540
 for us to peel back into some of those layers.

22
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,980
 So using stories sometimes is the best way.

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,860
 So that's why we're doing this sermon series.

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,260
 We've got four parables.

25
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,760
 Last week, if you were here,

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,340
 Pastor Ellison walked us through the parable of the sower.

27
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,180
 We saw all the different ideas of where the seed is thrown,

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,600
 and ultimately the story and the meaning behind that

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,860
 was the soil of our hearts.

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,660
 We need to make sure the soil of our hearts

31
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,320
 is fertile ground for the word of God

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
 to actually be planted and to bloom and to live within us.

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,060
 This week, we're gonna turn our attention towards Luke 15,

34
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,020
 looking at the parable of the prodigal son,

35
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,020
 or the lost son, or the two sons.

36
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,020
 Now, this parable is, it's one of three, actually,

37
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,180
 in Luke 15.

38
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,020
 Why do I keep saying John?

39
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,940
 Luke 15.

40
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,140
 So Jesus starts off by talking about some sheep

41
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,260
 and about how there's all these sheep this guy has,

42
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,540
 and then he loses one, and he goes and finds it,

43
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,880
 and he rejoices, like, "Celebrate with me.

44
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,440
 "My lost sheep is back."

45
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,860
 And then he goes to a coin.

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,860
 This lady has a bunch of coins, and she loses one,

47
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,500
 and she looks everywhere and finds the one coin,

48
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,340
 and she celebrates.

49
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,780
 She says, "Guys, come celebrate with me.

50
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,240
 "Rejoice, I found my coin."

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,780
 And then, so he takes the sheep, the coin,

52
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,340
 and then he jumps like a massive level

53
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,940
 and then brings it to family.

54
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,500
 Talks about sons and about fathers

55
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,180
 and about the relationship,

56
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,420
 and ends up looking at lost sons and that whole journey.

57
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,500
 And so normally here at the Vine,

58
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,060
 what we would do is we would put up the text behind us,

59
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,900
 and we would all read it,

60
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,660
 or I would read it and you would watch.

61
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,340
 But in the spirit of this being a parable,

62
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,580
 I kinda wanna take us to that posture

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,820
 of what it would've been like to hear it

64
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,780
 for the first time.

65
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,260
 So back when Jesus was preaching,

66
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,140
 he didn't have PowerPoints.

67
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,260
 There wasn't a great creative team

68
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,140
 to make it all look nice.

69
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,740
 So we're gonna go back to that space just for a minute.

70
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,940
 You won't be able to read along.

71
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,780
 That's on purpose.

72
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,660
 We're not gonna put the scripture up.

73
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,260
 I'm gonna tell you the story.

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,580
 And one of the ways I feel like

75
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,860
 it can really help you dive into this

76
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,380
 is if you sit back, relax, take a breath, get comfortable,

77
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,740
 close your eyes, but don't fall asleep, okay?

78
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,820
 Okay, I saw someone at 9.15.

79
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,140
 I didn't clarify that the first time.

80
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,060
 Close your eyes.

81
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,100
 I'm just gonna tell you the story.

82
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,060
 I'm not actually gonna read it either.

83
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,340
 I'm gonna give you a rendition of it.

84
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,180
 And then what we're gonna do

85
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,100
 is we're gonna look at the characters,

86
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,580
 at what lessons is Jesus really wanting us

87
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,460
 to pull from this,

88
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,340
 and actually, hopefully, understand more about God

89
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,100
 and understand more about the kingdom of God.

90
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,940
 So let me pray, and then you can close your eyes,

91
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,780
 and we're gonna get started.

92
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,300
 Jesus, we thank you for your word.

93
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,940
 We thank you that you understood the human condition

94
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,020
 and that we sometimes need stories

95
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,100
 to really understand and wrestle with your truth.

96
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,540
 So Holy Spirit, would you just be with us this morning

97
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,340
 as we look at this story of the two sons?

98
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,540
 Would you open our eyes, open our ears

99
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,860
 to hear what it is that you want us to know

100
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,020
 about who you are, about the Father,

101
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,980
 and about the kingdom of God.

102
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,420
 We ask you these things in Jesus' name, amen.

103
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,980
 All right, eyes closed, here we go.

104
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,300
 There was a dude, there was a man,

105
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,420
 there was an older guy who had two sons.

106
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,060
 He had these two kids, and the youngest of the two kids

107
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,140
 was a little crazy.

108
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,500
 He was like, "Dad, give me my inheritance now."

109
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,780
 So Dad gave him his inheritance.

110
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,140
 He divided up his property

111
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,860
 and gave his son his inheritance early.

112
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,700
 And what did the son do?

113
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,340
 The son set off for a distant land, went far away.

114
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,340
 And he spent all of his money on wild, reckless living.

115
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,940
 And then, when he has no more money,

116
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,180
 just at that point, the nation that he's in

117
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,260
 goes into famine.

118
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,500
 They can't grow any food, there's no water,

119
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 everything is tight and challenging,

120
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,260
 and he's hit rock bottom with money,

121
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,900
 and now the land he's in has no food,

122
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,060
 and there's no opportunity for him,

123
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,780
 and he's really looking for a place to go,

124
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,100
 and he doesn't have any money, so he tries to get a job.

125
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,340
 He can't find anyone to give him a job,

126
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,500
 so he sees this one position open,

127
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,220
 and it's a pretty unfun position, it's feeding pigs.

128
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,660
 So he takes the job feeding the pigs,

129
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,100
 and while he's out there feeding the pigs one day,

130
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,940
 making very little money, he's so hungry,

131
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,540
 I mean, he's desperately hungry,

132
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,620
 that the food the pigs are eating looks appetizing,

133
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,100
 so he wants to eat that.

134
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,420
 And then he has this moment where he comes to his senses,

135
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,500
 and he's like, hold on, in my dad's house,

136
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,340
 you know, the servants have food to spare.

137
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,180
 So he's like, you know what I'll do?

138
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,860
 I'll pack up my things, and I'll go back to my dad,

139
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,220
 and I'll tell him, dad, I've sinned against heaven,

140
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,820
 and against you, I'm no longer worthy to be called your son,

141
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,700
 but if you would just give me a position as a servant.

142
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,300
 So he got his little speech together,

143
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,940
 and he picked up nothing that he had,

144
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,740
 and just walked back, started going back.

145
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,860
 And while he was a long ways off, the father sees him,

146
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,140
 and his compassion, and his joy.

147
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,460
 He runs to his son, and throws his arms around him,

148
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,620
 and kisses him, and his son's like, father,

149
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,340
 I'm no longer worthy to be called your son,

150
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,580
 I have sinned against heaven, and against you,

151
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,620
 and the father stops him, and he's like,

152
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,620
 y'all, let's celebrate, go get the fattest cow we have,

153
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,820
 bring a ring and put it on his hand,

154
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,780
 grab some sandals for him, put a robe around him,

155
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,500
 my son who was lost is now found.

156
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,540
 So they did, they got a party together.

157
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,820
 And the older son who was there was out in the fields,

158
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,900
 and he was working, and he heard all this ruckus,

159
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,380
 and this noise, so he makes his way back over.

160
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,700
 He's asking the servants, what's going on?

161
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,380
 Servant's like, your brother who was lost is back,

162
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,700
 and your dad's killed the biggest cow that we have for him.

163
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,660
 So brother gets a bit annoyed and frustrated,

164
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,460
 so annoyed that he won't even go into the celebration.

165
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,140
 The father comes out, and pleased with his son,

166
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,620
 and his son's like, dad, I've been here the whole time,

167
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,460
 I've never disobeyed a word that you said,

168
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,980
 and you've not even killed a goat for me,

169
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,220
 for me and my friends.

170
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,440
 Dad says, you have me with you always,

171
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,100
 but listen, we have to rejoice, we have to celebrate,

172
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,840
 because your brother who was once lost is now found.

173
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,860
 You can open your eyes again.

174
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,180
 This is one of the most beautiful stories of love

175
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,660
 in all of scripture.

176
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,700
 It's incredible, right, but it's complex.

177
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,220
 It's deep, and it revolves around

178
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,100
 these three main characters.

179
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,860
 There's the father, there's the son who runs away

180
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,100
 and squanders all the money,

181
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,180
 and then there's the son who stays

182
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,980
 and has something to say to the dad.

183
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,540
 And I think what Jesus meant to do

184
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,300
 was for us to look at these three characters,

185
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,000
 look at the context of the story,

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,380
 and really understand what the kingdom of heaven is like,

187
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,220
 and what the father himself is like.

188
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,860
 So we're gonna do that by first looking at the first son

189
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,180
 and seeing what lesson does Jesus ultimately

190
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,980
 wanna teach us through this first son.

191
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,820
 So that first son, the one that runs away,

192
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,780
 gets the money, runs off, goes to a faraway land.

193
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,300
 I found this detail very interesting.

194
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,640
 He goes far away.

195
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,580
 He gets his money, rather than going next door

196
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
 or going to the neighboring,

197
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,020
 he goes to a distant land away from everyone

198
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,460
 to do his own thing.

199
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,240
 Doesn't wanna be in a relationship with anybody anymore,

200
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,580
 doesn't want any accountability,

201
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,500
 wants to go and do his own thing.

202
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 So he does that, he emancipates himself,

203
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,700
 he removes himself from the family.

204
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,660
 He goes and he has no stewardship at all, no home training.

205
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,940
 He spends all his money and does a poor job budgeting.

206
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,300
 And once that's done, the land ends up in famine,

207
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,980
 which is terrible, so now he's hitting rock bottom.

208
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,500
 There's nothing he can do to get himself back up.

209
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,020
 He said he's eating the food of pigs,

210
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,140
 and I think we're all familiar with that part.

211
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,340
 His life literally couldn't get any worse,

212
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,380
 and I think it's really interesting,

213
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,060
 'cause I think maybe for lots of us

214
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,980
 who might have hit a version of rock bottom,

215
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,220
 we found this, in that moment of rock bottom,

216
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,460
 something clicks.

217
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,340
 He has a bit of an experience, something changes.

218
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,580
 It says that he comes to his senses.

219
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,340
 I think the first truth that we see

220
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,540
 around this parable is what repentance is.

221
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,660
 Repentance is much like coming to your senses.

222
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,260
 To come to one's senses would mean

223
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,860
 that whatever you might have believed prior to that moment,

224
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,260
 you now understand is incorrect, it was misleading.

225
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,060
 It was an illusion, or at best, it was incomplete.

226
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,620
 And all the son had done before,

227
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,420
 all his actions of reckless spending and running away

228
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,620
 and taking his dad's stuff was based off of his perspective,

229
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,580
 based off of the way that he saw things.

230
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,420
 And so to repent, that first stage looks like

231
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,980
 changing the way that we see, coming to our senses.

232
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,560
 To repent is to have a new perspective.

233
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,340
 It must mean that we have to think differently

234
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,700
 about our situation, about our sin.

235
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
 We must have that change of perspective

236
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,420
 and that coming to our senses.

237
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,100
 But we know, we all know that it doesn't end there, right?

238
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,600
 Repentance can't just be the way that you see things.

239
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,260
 It can't just be about more head knowledge

240
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,020
 or more information.

241
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,340
 Just because you understand more

242
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,060
 or because you have more information

243
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,980
 doesn't really make the change, does it?

244
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,380
 I mean, think about our culture today.

245
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,900
 We have access to the most amount of information ever

246
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,420
 than any period in history.

247
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,700
 That doesn't necessarily mean

248
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,020
 that things are changing for the better.

249
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,640
 What we don't need is necessarily more information.

250
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,980
 Sometimes what we do need is more obedience.

251
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,540
 And what does information do if there is no action?

252
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,180
 And so although, yes, repentance will start

253
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,100
 with that turning of the mind

254
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,720
 and more information being changed,

255
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,720
 it must lead, it mandates that we then turn our will,

256
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,000
 that we then turn our actions,

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,140
 that we then turn ourselves.

258
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,100
 You're probably wondering why am I saying the word turn?

259
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,700
 Well, the word repent itself means to turn.

260
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,140
 So if I'm repenting, if I'm walking this way,

261
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,940
 to repent would mean to turn around, right?

262
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,800
 So that's what this young man is doing.

263
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
 He is turning around in his mind and his perspective,

264
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,060
 but then he also physically turns around.

265
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,280
 He returns to the Father.

266
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,580
 He leaves his foolish thinking and his foolish living,

267
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,980
 and he makes his way back to the Father.

268
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,700
 And what Jesus partially tells us this story

269
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,160
 so that we can get to this next part,

270
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,380
 about what happens next,

271
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,240
 when we would turn and we would repent,

272
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,460
 which is actually the reason I was so excited

273
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,280
 about preaching this specific sermon

274
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,120
 is for this next section.

275
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,500
 The son that repents and turns, what happens to him next?

276
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,900
 The story goes that, well, the Father does something crazy,

277
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
 does something radical, something that is off script

278
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,420
 that no one would expect, right?

279
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,460
 The Father isn't reckless.

280
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,700
 The Father is responding to deep love.

281
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,260
 The Father is calculated.

282
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,660
 The actions of the Father

283
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,820
 are therefore interested in restoring.

284
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,660
 The text would say this,

285
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,100
 while he was a long way off, speaking of the son,

286
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,660
 his father saw him and was filled with compassion.

287
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,780
 He ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.

288
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,660
 The son said, "Father, I've sinned against heaven

289
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,500
 "and against you.

290
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,980
 "I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."

291
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,080
 But the Father said to his servants,

292
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,320
 "Quick, bring the best robe, put it on him.

293
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,500
 "Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.

294
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,960
 "Bring the fattened calf and kill it.

295
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
 "Let's have a feast and celebrate,

296
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,620
 "for the son of mine was dead and is alive again.

297
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,140
 "He was lost and is now found."

298
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,340
 So they began to celebrate.

299
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,580
 The Father is overjoyed to see the son again.

300
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,140
 He doesn't wait for the son to make it all the way back.

301
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,340
 He says, while he was a long way off,

302
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,300
 the Father sprints toward him.

303
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,060
 The son's not even close to being home yet.

304
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,660
 The Father doesn't even meet him halfway.

305
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,700
 This idea that God's gonna meet us halfway

306
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,540
 is not biblical, right?

307
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,780
 Like, God goes the whole way.

308
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,740
 Like, the son is all the way over there

309
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,580
 and the Father sees that he's turned around

310
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,020
 and is coming back and he runs towards him

311
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,860
 in compassion, overjoyed about this.

312
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,140
 And I think it gets me, what gets me is,

313
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,220
 when I try and visualize how beautiful this is,

314
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,560
 I think about my three-year-old son

315
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,140
 and how if there was a moment where he's coming to me,

316
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,300
 we used to live in Chonkwano

317
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,940
 and I used to get home from work late

318
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,900
 and it'd be around maybe like seven or something

319
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,780
 and my wife would leave our estate

320
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,180
 and start walking towards us and I'd be walking home.

321
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,040
 And the second I saw my son,

322
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,340
 I mean, I didn't physically run because it's hot in Hong Kong

323
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,820
 but my heart ran, I was thrilled, I was so excited.

324
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,020
 I could only imagine, you know,

325
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,320
 when I've not seen my son for a whole day,

326
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,060
 this dude's son has been in a different country.

327
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,600
 The condition and the appearance of the son is saddening,

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
 probably breaks his heart.

329
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,640
 So it probably pushes him even more into that moment

330
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,600
 but the father runs to him, drops everything

331
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,540
 and is filled with compassion to see his boy again.

332
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:14,720
 This is a decisive and aggressive, fervent love.

333
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,600
 It's extreme grace.

334
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,120
 And it's extreme grace because note this,

335
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,240
 the father could have just forgiven him.

336
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,580
 This would have been a beautiful parable

337
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,100
 if it was about how a son really messed up,

338
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,020
 I mean, as bad as it gets and he gets what he deserves

339
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,380
 and when he comes and tries to apologize,

340
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,340
 the father says, "Okay, you're forgiven."

341
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,180
 And that's the end of the parable.

342
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,540
 If that was the story,

343
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,980
 that would be a pretty powerful parable.

344
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,140
 But it doesn't just stop there.

345
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,100
 The father's love is so extreme.

346
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,140
 It's so extreme that the son tries to get out his phrase,

347
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,500
 "Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you.

348
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,400
 I'm no longer worthy."

349
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,040
 And I imagine the father just putting his hand

350
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,300
 to his son's mouth, saying, "Stop.

351
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,280
 You're my son.

352
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,760
 You're here.

353
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,160
 That's what matters."

354
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,000
 And the father doesn't just forgive him.

355
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,800
 The father reinstates him.

356
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,640
 Rather than saying, "All is forgiven.

357
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,240
 Your slate is clean."

358
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,600
 The father says, "Go get the best stuff we have.

359
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,280
 Get the best robe," he says.

360
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,980
 "Get a ring, get a sandal, kill the A5 Wagyu."

361
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,560
 Like he wants the good stuff for his son,

362
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,080
 who has just done all this mess.

363
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,760
 He does not just forgive us.

364
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,520
 He reinstates.

365
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,080
 And I think we have to come to the understanding

366
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,660
 that this is God's posture.

367
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,640
 This is the father's posture to us as well.

368
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,420
 Can we talk about how,

369
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,320
 if I put myself in the position of the son,

370
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,960
 forgiveness would have been great.

371
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,980
 But I wonder how he felt when his dad hugged him

372
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,820
 in that moment.

373
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,700
 I wonder what he felt when he's dirty and stinky

374
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,780
 and smelly and tired and exhausted and not worthy,

375
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,780
 yet his father throws his arms around him.

376
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,700
 Talk about getting more than you deserve.

377
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,980
 I feel like that motion probably,

378
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,460
 that moment probably flooded him with plenty of emotion

379
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,720
 to be received again.

380
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,620
 See, the father had no intention

381
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,740
 of making a repentant son a slave.

382
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,100
 I think we have to hear that for what it's really saying.

383
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,700
 Our father has no intention

384
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,180
 of making a repentant us a slave,

385
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,940
 but rather in his great joy,

386
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,420
 he restores us back to sonship and daughtership.

387
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,940
 It is joy that he does it.

388
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,380
 It's not because he has to,

389
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,460
 because he's God, because he's obligated.

390
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
 It's within his joy.

391
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,340
 And if you don't believe me,

392
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,700
 three different times it says it.

393
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,540
 In the first parable about the sheep,

394
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,740
 it says this, at the very end of it,

395
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,100
 he goes, "Rejoice with me.

396
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,420
 "I have found my lost sheep."

397
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,820
 When the parable gets to the next part about the coin,

398
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,100
 the woman says, "Rejoice with me.

399
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,420
 "I found my lost coin."

400
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,020
 When it gets to the son for the third time,

401
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,700
 "Rejoice and celebrate, be glad."

402
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,440
 There is joy that God feels about restoring you.

403
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,180
 When you come back, it is in his joy to bring you,

404
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,800
 not just to forgive you, but to reinstate you,

405
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,100
 to bring you into the family of God.

406
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,420
 Because in that space,

407
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,900
 there is a relationship that is restored.

408
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,780
 In that space, there is hope, there is meaning,

409
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,580
 there is identity.

410
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,960
 He wants to provide all of that for us.

411
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,220
 This restored identity is a theme

412
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,860
 that we cannot afford to overlook.

413
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,440
 There's something to be said about how identity

414
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,560
 and relationship are major threads into this story,

415
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,580
 and into the kingdom of God as a whole.

416
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,420
 I think that's why this story

417
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,580
 is drenched with identity imagery.

418
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,460
 Did you notice how every main character

419
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,060
 isn't referred to by their name?

420
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,700
 Or by their job?

421
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,500
 It's the father, it's the son, it's the other son.

422
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,980
 Who they are communicated as is based off of relationship.

423
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,700
 Relationship is so important.

424
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,140
 It elevates the meaning of this parable.

425
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,300
 Let me think about it this way.

426
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,620
 What if this parable wasn't called the prodigal son?

427
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,720
 What if it was called the prodigal friend?

428
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,660
 You guys know Jethro, who leads worship here,

429
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,620
 stunning young man with the guitar.

430
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,060
 He's a good friend of mine.

431
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,020
 If Jethro took my money and went to Indonesia,

432
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,340
 love you Jethro, and spent it all,

433
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,540
 and got what he deserved, lost his money,

434
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,260
 and is eating pig food, comes back to Hong Kong,

435
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,240
 and is like, bro, I'm sorry.

436
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,740
 Okay, well, first of all, I'm a pastor,

437
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,140
 so I'm gonna say yes, Jethro, I forgive you, right?

438
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,280
 That's what pastors and Christians do.

439
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,380
 But if my son, Elias, made the same mistake,

440
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,300
 hear this, it would hurt significantly more.

441
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,140
 It really would.

442
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,440
 It would tear me apart.

443
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,100
 But if he came back, that joy would be ridiculous,

444
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,220
 and I would not stop at saying, you're forgiven, son.

445
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,040
 I'll go do your thing.

446
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,300
 You're forgiven, come be a servant.

447
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,860
 No, I would throw my arms around him, 'cause he's my boy.

448
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,460
 He's my kid, he's me, right?

449
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,620
 And I think if you understand this story,

450
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,580
 you understand the power of family,

451
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,140
 that's what Jesus is talking about.

452
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,680
 It's not just about the forgiveness of the sin,

453
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,140
 it's about the ultimate goal being restoring us

454
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,300
 into the right identity.

455
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,900
 The scriptures talk about this all over the place.

456
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,780
 Why do you think it is that we're called sons and daughters

457
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,300
 of God, children of God?

458
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,720
 When Jesus would teach the disciples to pray,

459
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,820
 which I find very fascinating,

460
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,580
 the one thing they tell him is, teach us this.

461
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,620
 They could tell him, they could ask him, teach us anything.

462
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,140
 He says, teach us how to pray.

463
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,540
 So Jesus says, okay, fine, I'll teach you how to pray.

464
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,180
 At that time, their posture towards divinity

465
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,940
 was that God is holy, God is Yahweh,

466
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,220
 we gotta be careful, make sure we don't sin too much,

467
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,140
 go through all these rituals.

468
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,560
 And he says, when you pray, pray like this.

469
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,740
 Our father, relationship.

470
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,660
 Not our extreme maker who is bigger than everything

471
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,500
 or Elohim or our father.

472
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,780
 There is something so significant

473
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,980
 in this relationship identity concept

474
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,420
 that the scripture wants us to understand,

475
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,580
 and it's because of this.

476
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,580
 As children of God, we get certain perks.

477
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,980
 There are things that happen within the family

478
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,380
 that won't happen outside the family.

479
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,140
 The way I love my son would be inappropriate

480
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,980
 for me to love any other person that way.

481
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,340
 The way I love my spouse or my daughter

482
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,180
 would be very different

483
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,700
 than the way I'm gonna love my friends,

484
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,220
 or the way I'm gonna engage with my friends.

485
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,540
 See, when you're in the family, there's something different.

486
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,260
 There's a grace that's for the family,

487
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
 there's a certain compassion that's for the family.

488
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,000
 The family deeply matters.

489
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,100
 And I think about how my son, although he's three,

490
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,740
 and let me just say, I overestimated three, y'all.

491
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,340
 He is, whoo, he's perfect, but man, I'm stressing.

492
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,460
 He does a lot of stuff, and I can never,

493
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,420
 I can't think of a reason that I would never love him.

494
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,460
 Like, I would love him no matter what.

495
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,520
 Like, he's great, but he's three, but he's great.

496
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,380
 But then there's you guys who, I like you,

497
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,420
 but I'm sure there are things you can do

498
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,740
 to make me stop liking you real quick.

499
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,100
 All right, some of you don't have to try that hard.

500
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,140
 It's pretty easy for some.

501
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,140
 But not with my kid, not with my family.

502
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,480
 And God has this posture towards us.

503
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,620
 That's why the ultimate blessing,

504
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,140
 the ultimate thing we can receive is not a gift,

505
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,780
 a Ferrari or a better job

506
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,660
 or a more stable relationship at home.

507
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,140
 The ultimate gift we can get

508
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,900
 is to be brought back into his family.

509
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,240
 That's what Emma was talking about.

510
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
 By the blood of Jesus, we're not just forgiven,

511
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,560
 we're brought into his family.

512
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,540
 This is how God intended humanity to be.

513
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,060
 In relationship with him, heirs of his,

514
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,020
 made to be like him, protected by him, his children.

515
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,660
 This is why Jesus in John three

516
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,160
 would speak to Nicodemus at night and he would say,

517
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,920
 "You must be, you must be born again.

518
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,260
 "You must be born into this family

519
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,980
 "because if you are in this family,

520
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,060
 "there is no sin that is deep enough

521
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,780
 "to separate me from you.

522
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,740
 "When you're mine, you're mine,

523
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,460
 "and I will go through anything to get you back."

524
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,540
 And this story ultimately is illustrating

525
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,780
 that exact thing, the perks that come

526
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,860
 with being sons and daughters of God.

527
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,820
 By repenting of our sins, by turning from our wrongdoings,

528
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,700
 as a child of God, know that you have access

529
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,720
 to the most extreme grace that there is.

530
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,860
 Now, we've talked about two characters.

531
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,340
 We've first looked at the crazy son,

532
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,020
 we've looked at the father and the grace

533
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,300
 that is just flowing from him,

534
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,340
 but there's a third character that we cannot overlook

535
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,320
 and the only way to really understand him

536
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,740
 is to understand the context of this parable.

537
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,040
 This parable, it's something that maybe is good

538
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,340
 for all of us in our basic Bible reading

539
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,700
 and scripture studying.

540
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,780
 It's always good to ask ourselves,

541
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,340
 how did we get to this point?

542
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,580
 Jesus might say something wild.

543
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,900
 Ask yourself, what made him say that?

544
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,700
 I think if we ask ourselves this question in this parable,

545
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,060
 why is Jesus telling a parable about sons?

546
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,100
 What is he responding to?

547
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,220
 What is making him tell this story?

548
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,980
 If you look at Luke chapter 15 at verse two,

549
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,380
 you get this context of the Pharisees

550
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,200
 who are the religious leaders of the day,

551
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,740
 the tax collectors and sinners, the degenerates,

552
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,780
 the worst of society, all gather together

553
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,620
 around to hear Jesus and the Pharisees,

554
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,420
 the teachers of the law, they muttered,

555
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,020
 so not intended to be heard, to one another,

556
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,660
 they say this, this man welcomes sinners

557
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
 and eats with them.

558
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,360
 This is our context.

559
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,620
 The fact that Jesus, the one who does the big miracles,

560
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,540
 the one claiming to be the way, the truth and the life,

561
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,660
 this holy man is spending his time

562
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,380
 with the worst of society.

563
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,980
 What's this guy really thinking?

564
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,620
 Like, can you be God and spend time with such filthy people,

565
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,980
 with the worst people, the cheaters, the liars,

566
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,340
 the prostitutes, the tax collectors, the thieves,

567
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,420
 the worst that society has to offer,

568
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,520
 yet Jesus is sharing meals, spending his time with them.

569
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,980
 So they say something about it.

570
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,260
 They don't have the courage to say it to Jesus,

571
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,460
 so they say it to one another, they mutter it,

572
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,860
 this man is hanging out with the worst people.

573
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,580
 And in response to that, Jesus hears it,

574
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,780
 he knows their heart.

575
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,140
 In response to that, he tells them this trilogy of parables,

576
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,820
 about coins, about sheep, and then ends with the big one

577
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,520
 about family, about the sons.

578
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,720
 And I think it's interesting that this ending,

579
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,560
 the story that he tells, talks about a father,

580
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,320
 talks about the degenerate, it talks about the holy.

581
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,400
 That's what the parable's about, right?

582
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,360
 The son, the father, and the other son.

583
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,800
 The people in this room, there's Jesus,

584
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,640
 who claims to be God, the father.

585
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,040
 There's the holy ones, the Pharisees,

586
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,200
 who know all the laws, who do everything right.

587
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,920
 And then there's the tax collectors and the sinners.

588
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,680
 See, there's the people in this room,

589
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,040
 and the sinners, see, there's a lesson

590
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,320
 Jesus wants us to see.

591
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,440
 He's using this story to tell the Pharisees

592
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,720
 and the sinners about how God sees sinners.

593
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
 So that's something we can't afford to miss in this.

594
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,200
 How does God see the sinner?

595
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,220
 When he's telling this story, I imagine that,

596
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,200
 you know, the crowd is expecting that if this son

597
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,240
 did this much damage, he takes his dad money and runs off.

598
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,560
 When he comes back, they're probably expecting,

599
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,920
 he's probably not gonna get brought back into the family.

600
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,480
 He's gonna get rebuked.

601
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,280
 He's gonna get told off, get scolded, maybe lectured.

602
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,560
 But Jesus is clever with his wording.

603
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,240
 Jesus says that the father welcomes the son.

604
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,600
 Well, what's the first accusation about what Jesus

605
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,080
 is doing in that moment?

606
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,980
 Back in chapter two, or in verse two,

607
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,280
 it says that they are annoyed and frustrated.

608
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,960
 This man welcomes and eats with sinners.

609
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,200
 In the story that Jesus tells, what happens?

610
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,760
 The father, this great man, welcomes back his son,

611
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,680
 puts the clothes and puts the robe

612
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,200
 and brings him back into the house, and then he does what?

613
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,480
 He takes them to lavash and they have a meal, right?

614
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,520
 They kill the fattened cow.

615
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,640
 He welcomes and he eats in the story and in the accusation.

616
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,520
 Jesus is being direct in story form.

617
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,960
 He's providing groundbreaking revelation,

618
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,680
 making it clear that God is not just our creator.

619
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,560
 He's not just powerful Yahweh, but he's father.

620
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,320
 And how does he see the sinner?

621
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,360
 How does the father see the sinner?

622
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,620
 Well, this is where it's key.

623
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,520
 For the sinner who will come to their senses,

624
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,360
 who will recognize their sin,

625
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,960
 and who will just attempt to make his way back home,

626
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,320
 how does the father respond?

627
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,260
 With ridiculous grace, with extreme grace,

628
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,700
 going way beyond what you need, what you want,

629
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,180
 beyond forgiveness into restoration, he brings you back in.

630
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,180
 Jesus tells this parable so that they would understand

631
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,740
 that if God comes down to earth,

632
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,140
 he's not hanging out with the holy people.

633
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,620
 When God comes down to earth, he's going for the lost.

634
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,340
 He's spending his time with those who are broken,

635
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,220
 those who are vulnerable.

636
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,060
 He's not gonna be concerned about maintaining his privilege

637
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,660
 or his status as God.

638
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,020
 He's gonna be with those who are broken.

639
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,220
 And if you think that God only cares for you

640
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,660
 if you do a good job with those who are within the church

641
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,060
 or those who have it right,

642
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,220
 then you might know the rules of God,

643
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
 but you don't know his heart.

644
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,220
 That's what Jesus is saying in this parable.

645
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,300
 It becomes so clear that the religious leaders,

646
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,380
 they don't actually know the father at all

647
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,740
 'cause they couldn't be more wrong

648
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,380
 about how he would respond.

649
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,700
 And this is why because they are the religious leaders.

650
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,900
 They set the climate, the temperature of what it means

651
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,460
 to be a follower of Yahweh, to have good spirituality.

652
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,180
 And it's clear from this that they don't even know the father

653
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,220
 because they would see it as,

654
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,660
 well, we're Pharisees, these are sinners.

655
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,220
 It would say in the Gospel of Matthew

656
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,740
 that Pharisees were very concerned about their status,

657
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,340
 about being upright, about they would dress a certain way

658
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,460
 when they went outside the streets.

659
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,300
 They would pray in a certain voice,

660
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,100
 pretty loud to be heard when they fasted.

661
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,980
 They were a bit dramatic about it,

662
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,300
 like soccer players and flopping.

663
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,660
 They were like, oh, I'm fasting,

664
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,860
 making sure everyone knew that they were fasting.

665
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,220
 They were all about the image and the appearance.

666
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,300
 Well, Jesus is contrasting himself with them

667
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,820
 because just like the Pharisees,

668
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,460
 Jesus sees that these are tax collectors.

669
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,780
 He knows.

670
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,500
 He knows that Matthew was cheating people from their money.

671
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,460
 He knew about Zachariah's problem.

672
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,020
 He knows that they're prostitutes.

673
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,620
 He knows their sin.

674
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,460
 Think back to John four, the woman at the well.

675
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,460
 He knows that she has multiple husbands, right?

676
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,300
 But what does he do?

677
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,700
 His privilege of being God

678
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,820
 does not stop him from coming close.

679
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,660
 Hear that.

680
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,660
 Because he's God doesn't mean he won't come close to our mess.

681
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,860
 Jesus would spin this story around

682
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,540
 telling of a prodigal son

683
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,820
 and telling of the position of our attitudes

684
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,980
 and the attitude of the older brother

685
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,980
 as being most clearly reflected in that of the Pharisees

686
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,860
 who are, get this,

687
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,340
 kind of just when you think about it like this,

688
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,420
 it creates, drives me,

689
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,980
 the Pharisees are holding Jesus's compassion against him.

690
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,540
 That's a hard way to look at it.

691
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,740
 Because he's so compassionate, they're angry.

692
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,300
 And this is exactly what you see in that final brother,

693
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,140
 that last kid.

694
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,540
 That's why you have to know the context.

695
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,420
 Because of Jesus' compassion, they're angry.

696
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,460
 Well, look at that older brother, what happens with him?

697
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,860
 He's angry that the younger brother

698
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,220
 who's been reckless and wild,

699
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,420
 whose life has been falling apart,

700
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,140
 comes back home and the father throws his arms over him,

701
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,580
 gives him all this stuff, gives him the fatted calf,

702
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,780
 celebrates and is rejoicing with him.

703
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,580
 The older son and the Pharisees share the same perspective.

704
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,940
 And as I studied this,

705
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,000
 I knew there were a lot of obvious points to make,

706
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,060
 but there was something that hit me for the first time.

707
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,020
 So the way the story goes is that the younger brother,

708
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
 when he gets what he wants from dad,

709
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,740
 he runs to a different land, right?

710
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,120
 He goes far, far away, like Jethro going far away.

711
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,100
 The older brother says,

712
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,620
 I stayed in your house the whole time.

713
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,460
 I was close to you.

714
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,340
 I was always obeying you, doing exactly what you wanted.

715
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,580
 So how then does the older brother

716
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,660
 who has stayed close to the father

717
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,720
 know the details of the sin of the younger brother?

718
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,820
 The younger brother was in a distant land.

719
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,900
 The older brother stayed close to dad.

720
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,740
 It's easy to say that, right?

721
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,820
 I've stayed close to you.

722
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,460
 I've done what you're supposed to do.

723
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,740
 How does he know what the brother is doing?

724
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,900
 Has he hired a spy?

725
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,520
 Does he have a scouting report on what his brother's doing?

726
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,680
 How is he aware?

727
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,520
 I mean, because you would think

728
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,340
 that to be in the father's house,

729
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,040
 your focus would be on the father.

730
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,300
 Hear that?

731
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,260
 See, the older brother is more focused

732
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,980
 on gathering a report of what the younger brother

733
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,020
 has done wrong.

734
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,260
 He has, maybe he's remained in the house,

735
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,860
 but he has not abided in the father

736
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,900
 because the father is compassionate,

737
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,380
 whereas the older brother is judgmental.

738
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,900
 While in the father's house,

739
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,660
 focused on the wrongdoings of others.

740
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,600
 This is the heart of the Pharisees.

741
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,820
 This is the way that they naturally found themselves.

742
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,320
 But I think we have to be careful

743
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,260
 because sometimes this can be us.

744
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,860
 This can be you and me sitting in this room.

745
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,620
 I think we have to ask ourselves these questions regularly.

746
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:28,060
 Are we becoming more like Christ in his love

747
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,100
 for the broken, for the worst of humanity,

748
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,380
 or becoming more self-righteous?

749
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,620
 We just wanna see them get what they deserve.

750
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,300
 Before we dismiss it quickly,

751
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,540
 because no one likes the title of self-righteousness,

752
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,240
 remember this, the Pharisees had all the laws memorized.

753
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,080
 They did it all right.

754
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,460
 They were the ones who prayed with the best words,

755
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,040
 and they were the ones who fasted regularly,

756
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,220
 and they had memorized the first five books of the Bible.

757
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
 I mean, they got it, they understood it.

758
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,760
 They were like the pastors of the day.

759
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,820
 I think we can come in every Sunday,

760
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,660
 and we can raise our hands during worship,

761
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,900
 or clap when Emma starts talking about the blood of Jesus.

762
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,740
 You know, amen.

763
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,260
 We can take our phones out and take a photo

764
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,020
 when there's a tweetable line in the sermon,

765
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,800
 but does that mean anything?

766
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,660
 Because that's not the indicator

767
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,020
 of the transition that we have to be going through,

768
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,020
 of the transformation that God really intends

769
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,340
 for those of us who remain here with him.

770
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:30,060
 To be offended by God's heart for the lost.

771
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,260
 This is their attitude, even though they do everything right.

772
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
 And I think we've gotta be careful

773
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,340
 to make sure that just because we come,

774
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,280
 we don't end up in that place,

775
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,060
 looking at, oh, God, I've done all these things,

776
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,340
 and they've done nothing.

777
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,660
 We don't wanna be those kinds of people.

778
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,300
 I don't want us to be those kind of people.

779
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,360
 Our proximity to Christ isn't a badge we wear

780
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,300
 that makes us better than other people.

781
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,640
 It's not.

782
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,740
 It's not our permission to point and say,

783
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,540
 look how bad they're doing.

784
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,260
 Doesn't give us a right to get online

785
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,780
 and blast everyone that's not a Christian

786
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,540
 for the ridiculous things that they might do.

787
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,260
 Guess what, they're not Christians.

788
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,100
 Imagine that.

789
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:13,140
 No, our proximity to God is meant to draw us close to him

790
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,260
 so that we can be transformed by him.

791
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,880
 Being close to God is less about being holier than others.

792
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,120
 It's more about becoming like him,

793
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,820
 becoming extreme in our grace,

794
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,260
 choosing compassion over judgment,

795
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,700
 oozing with compassion.

796
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,120
 When our brothers and sisters are lost,

797
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,940
 being excited to see them come home,

798
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,540
 co-laboring with the Father.

799
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,700
 That's my heart for me, my family.

800
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,760
 That's my heart for us as a community.

801
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,540
 That in our weekly gatherings,

802
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,500
 in the gatherings that take place outside of Sundays here,

803
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,420
 that we would be growing in our likeness of God.

804
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,720
 That our hearts would be becoming softer

805
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,220
 and being more like his.

806
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,940
 That he would replace the heart of stone

807
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,960
 and give us a heart of flesh.

808
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,200
 That he would wipe away the scales from our eyes,

809
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,420
 and we would see people the way that he sees them,

810
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,900
 being shaped like him.

811
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,180
 That we would be broken for the loss,

812
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,100
 the way that he's broken for the loss.

813
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,000
 And that we would rejoice when they come home.

814
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,700
 We would rejoice when they repent.

815
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,780
 And for me, where I find this most challenging,

816
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,260
 I have to ask myself this.

817
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,260
 Would I be rejoicing, celebrating,

818
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,460
 and the worst person that I know,

819
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,240
 most filthy person that I know,

820
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,480
 the liar, the cheater,

821
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,820
 the one who's weaseled their way, who's offended me,

822
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,100
 comes into God's family,

823
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,300
 and he gets the exact same privilege as I do.

824
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,540
 Can I celebrate at that?

825
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,580
 Because I think it's that what drives the son crazy.

826
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,100
 It's not just that he's forgiven.

827
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,140
 It's that he's now restored to the same level.

828
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,760
 And that blood of Jesus, like Emma said,

829
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,860
 that is our ultimate equalizer.

830
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,260
 That's what makes us all be able to be

831
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,980
 on the same level again.

832
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,220
 And that's what the father is ultimately showing us

833
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
 through all of this.

834
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,160
 Now, with all this repentance and grace,

835
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,820
 I think there's one last question

836
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,460
 that I want us to kind of wrestle with a little bit

837
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,820
 before we get to a closing point.

838
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,820
 See, what do you think those who were sinning,

839
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,180
 those who were the sinners,

840
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,380
 Jesus was having dinner with them, right?

841
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,920
 What do you think they were thinking?

842
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,680
 How do you think they felt when the holy teacher, Jesus,

843
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,880
 talks about God welcoming sinners?

844
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,740
 What do you think their feelings were in that moment?

845
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,820
 Because they would be well acquainted with their sins.

846
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,900
 They know where they've fallen short.

847
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,860
 I wonder if when they hear that the father welcomes back,

848
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,660
 kills the shattered calf,

849
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,900
 puts the ring on the arm, on the finger,

850
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,020
 I wonder if maybe goosebumps happened, you know?

851
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,260
 I wonder if like they might have gotten choked up

852
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,500
 a little bit, maybe a lump in their throat,

853
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,920
 maybe a little heavy breathing.

854
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,600
 Because to know that God is going to respond

855
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,360
 with such grace if we repent can be liberating.

856
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,400
 It can lead us to actual repentance.

857
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,420
 I think this is what Jesus is trying to show us

858
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,960
 with this whole story.

859
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,340
 Could it be that by learning of the father's posture

860
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,240
 for restoring those who are lost,

861
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,620
 some of their hearts are softened?

862
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,600
 Could that be the same for us?

863
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,080
 That if you ask yourself this,

864
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,840
 if you could really understand

865
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,440
 that no matter what it is that you've done,

866
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,240
 it doesn't matter how bad it is, I mean the worst thing,

867
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,800
 if you were to have a come to your senses moment,

868
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,920
 if we were just to turn,

869
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,400
 remember you don't have to have it all right yet,

870
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,200
 if we were just to start that journey back home,

871
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,280
 the father doesn't just say,

872
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,440
 "Good job, thanks for not sinning anymore."

873
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,400
 He rejoices, like joy, happiness, celebration,

874
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,480
 let's throw a party, that's his response.

875
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,760
 The scriptures would say that the angels in heaven

876
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,500
 are celebrating over this.

877
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,680
 I wonder if we could get that.

878
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,320
 How would that impact our desire

879
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,300
 or our courage to actually repent?

880
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,620
 Oftentimes repentance is seen as this doom and gloom thing.

881
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,120
 What this shows is that repentance

882
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,640
 is something that's met with joy.

883
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,600
 We don't have to be all serious and sad when we repent.

884
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,120
 We come back to God and he's excited to have us.

885
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,920
 He loves us, overflowing with joy.

886
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,600
 If we understand that repentance is a joyful moment,

887
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
 would we dare repent more?

888
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,400
 Could it be something that we would do regularly?

889
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,160
 'Cause here's the thing, this is what Satan's trying to do.

890
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,300
 Here's the big picture, go back to Genesis for a second.

891
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,560
 When Adam and Eve sin in the garden,

892
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,000
 they take the buyer of the apple,

893
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,800
 they recognize that they're naked, and what do they do?

894
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,520
 They hide.

895
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,320
 They distance themselves.

896
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,160
 They separate, sin separates us from God,

897
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,360
 but this is what grace does.

898
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,520
 Grace says that if you would come to your senses,

899
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,320
 if you would put your faith in Jesus,

900
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,080
 if you would understand that he is the way,

901
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,040
 the truth, and the life,

902
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,520
 if you would just make an effort to come towards him,

903
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,200
 you don't have to get it all right,

904
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,480
 but if you would just take a step, he'll meet you.

905
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,480
 He'll sprint towards you, and he will be so glad.

906
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,520
 Not just to forgive,

907
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,840
 but to make you a part of the family again,

908
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,680
 to make you an heir, someone who gets things from him,

909
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,960
 someone who is loved by him,

910
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,380
 someone who is protected by him, taken care of by him.

911
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,000
 Guys, I pray this is something that we can understand

912
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,840
 and fully get.

913
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,440
 I pray that the courage needed

914
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,880
 from an understanding of the extreme grace of the Father

915
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,680
 would find its way to you,

916
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,540
 because repentance is a bit of an invitation.

917
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,980
 It's God making it clear that you're welcomed back

918
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,700
 and you're wanted back.

919
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,220
 So I think we all need to keep this in mind.

920
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,560
 You're wanted.

921
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,920
 God wants you in his family.

922
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,260
 If he didn't, he would just forgive you

923
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,540
 and let you on your way,

924
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,060
 but he wants you to be a part of that family.

925
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,880
 He wants you to be under that covering,

926
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,160
 under that protection.

927
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,900
 He desires to see you not just forgiven of your sin.

928
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,940
 John 3, 16, "For God so hated sin

929
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,780
 "that he came into the world."

930
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,660
 No, for God so loved the world.

931
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,200
 His posture is love towards you.

932
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,520
 He desires to see you flourish, to see you at peace,

933
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,240
 to see you the way that he's intended your life to be.

934
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,500
 And that takes place when we're able to turn from our sins.

935
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,060
 Here, I wanna leave us with this.

936
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,540
 As the worship team makes their way up,

937
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:39,220
 there is one of my favorite C.S. Lewis quotes,

938
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,740
 and if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is,

939
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,980
 Ananias series is incredible, please read it.

940
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,780
 It'll enrich your life.

941
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,540
 But Lewis, in one of his books called

942
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,420
 "The Screwtape Letters," which is a book

943
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,980
 where demons are writing letters to Satan about people.

944
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,200
 Very wild, very crazy, but very insightful.

945
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,300
 This one demon is writing,

946
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:07,300
 and he says this about the human effort,

947
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,580
 about the divine satisfaction and love.

948
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,740
 And it is profound and it blows my mind

949
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,740
 and it stays with me.

950
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,740
 I've written songs about it.

951
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,280
 I've talked about it all the time.

952
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,860
 I wanna leave you guys with it

953
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,940
 'cause I hope it can help you.

954
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,720
 It says this, "He," meaning the father,

955
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,160
 "He wants them," meaning us,

956
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,900
 "He wants them to learn how to walk

957
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,640
 "and must therefore take away his hands.

958
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,980
 "And if only the will to walk is really there,

959
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:48,860
 "he is pleased," get this, "even in their stumbles."

960
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,640
 Guys, for lots of us, it won't be a clean walk home.

961
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,200
 For lots of us, it will be stumbles.

962
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,620
 It's not an easy route back,

963
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,420
 but here's the thing, the heavy lifting is done by him.

964
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,460
 He's gonna carry you through.

965
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,720
 He's your strength.

966
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,760
 He is the rock that you build your hope on.

967
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,200
 He is your strong tower.

968
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,400
 He is your ever present help in times of need

969
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,000
 and in times where you don't realize that you have need.

970
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,360
 Even in our stumbles, he will be pleased

971
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,580
 and he will be with us.

972
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,520
 So God, we come to you this morning

973
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,520
 and we recognize and are overwhelmed by your grace,

974
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,160
 by your extreme fervent love,

975
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,160
 by love so extreme that it welcomes in the sinner.

976
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,680
 It welcomes in those of us who are Christians

977
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,120
 and who have made such terrible mistakes

978
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,380
 that we're afraid to come to you.

979
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,040
 It welcomes, it dines with, it reinstates,

980
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,500
 and it restores us.

981
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,080
 So Holy Spirit, there are so many lies

982
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,060
 and so many fears about being judged by God,

983
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,140
 but to the one who would return,

984
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,820
 there is this truth that your love should cast out our fear,

985
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,080
 that your love is enough,

986
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,200
 that the blood of Jesus runs deeper

987
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,640
 than anything your child or children could do.

988
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,200
 And so God, help us not just believe it,

989
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,560
 but Holy Spirit, would you put that as a seed into our heart

990
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,000
 and would you keep that soil fertile so this grows in us

991
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,020
 into a tree of understanding that you want us

992
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,120
 and you welcome us.

993
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,240
 And no matter what we've done,

994
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,140
 if the thief on the cross could get in at the last minute,

995
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,440
 it doesn't matter what we've done,

996
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,720
 if we would turn to you,

997
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,320
 we will find hope, we will find a father

998
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,880
 who isn't waiting to beat us, but who is overjoyed.

999
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,000
 God, for those of us who feel distant,

1000
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,200
 who feel like we can't talk to you

1001
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,280
 'cause our sin is so bad, I rebuke that lie.

1002
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,420
 Holy Spirit, would you come in and speak your truth?

1003
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,620
 Would you remind that light shines best in darkness,

1004
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,120
 that you came not to be served, but to serve us,

1005
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,900
 that those of us who are sick,

1006
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,800
 those of us who are in need of you,

1007
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,500
 that's who you came for.

1008
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,620
 Lord, would you open our hearts,

1009
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,460
 lead us to that coming to our senses moment

1010
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,340
 and give us the courage to turn our hearts,

1011
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,900
 our minds, our postures, and our will back to you.

1012
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,660
 In Jesus' name, amen.

1013
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,240
 (gentle music)

1014
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,820
 (gentle music)

1015
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,880
 you
