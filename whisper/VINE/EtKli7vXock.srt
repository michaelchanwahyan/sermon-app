1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
 Can we give our worship team a great thank you.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,840
 So good to see you guys and welcome to the Vine

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,960
 if this is your first time, have a seat.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,440
 We're glad that you are with us.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,760
 Welcome Upper House.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,640
 (congregation laughing)

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,740
 I'll be here all week.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,720
 Welcome everybody online.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,420
 We're so glad that you guys are tuning in as well.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,240
 We know that people are tuning in from all over the world.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,440
 You might be in Hong Kong right now.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,900
 You might be somewhere else.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,520
 We're so glad that you're watching this weather live

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,120
 with us in this moment or catching up

15
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,340
 at a time that's convenient for you.

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,520
 We pray and believe that through technology,

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,960
 God moves just as much and just as powerfully

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,120
 as if you were in this room.

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,660
 So we are grateful for you.

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,480
 Thanks for tuning in today and for each one of you.

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,560
 Who's been here for most of the series

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,240
 for the different spirit series?

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,680
 Let's have a look at your hands.

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,520
 Most of you.

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,940
 All right, that's the majority of people here.

26
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,780
 That's wonderful.

27
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,000
 That's great.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,040
 We're finishing that series today.

29
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,880
 And I wanna speak to you about your courage

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,240
 and your strength.

31
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,760
 I actually believe that the number one thing

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,160
 that the Holy Spirit wants us to finish this series with

33
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,280
 as a way of launching us into the next thing

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,440
 is by reminding you about your source

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,840
 and your need for courage and strength.

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,600
 So let me start by sharing with you

37
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,720
 something out of my own life.

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,660
 I have a phobia.

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,840
 It's actually a clinically defined phobia.

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,840
 My phobia is that I'm afraid of the ocean.

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,120
 Yeah, I know.

42
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,360
 It's pretty sad.

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,400
 I've struggled with this fear for the majority of my life.

44
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,640
 I don't mind, to be honest,

45
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,200
 being on a boat floating on the ocean.

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,600
 I don't mind maybe like walking on a beach,

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,680
 putting my toes a little bit in the water of an ocean.

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,000
 But the idea of swimming in an ocean

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,960
 fills me with absolute terror.

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,060
 Now, I'm not exactly sure how this started,

51
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,880
 but it might've been at the moment

52
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,480
 when at the age of eight years old,

53
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,160
 my parents allowed me to watch the film "Jaws."

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,640
 Anyone else seen "Jaws" here?

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,200
 Do not let your children watch "Jaws."

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,720
 I was eight years old

57
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,440
 and I spent the whole movie with my two pillows

58
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,280
 in front of my eyes,

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,920
 but I couldn't stop looking away

60
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,760
 from this ferocious water-based mammal of a shark

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,600
 eating everything in its path.

62
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,400
 By the way, I also have a minor phobia to cello music.

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,880
 And the whole time I was filled with such dread, such fear,

64
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,960
 and that impacted my whole childhood up to this day.

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,460
 Now, when you grow up in Hong Kong,

66
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,640
 being afraid of the ocean is a bit of a problem.

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,320
 There's over 200 islands that make up Hong Kong.

68
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,420
 And when you're young here,

69
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,280
 I spent the majority of my weekends

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,440
 hanging out with friends on junks or whatever it might be,

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
 and they'd all be jumping off the top of the boat,

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,280
 they'd all be swimming around,

73
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,280
 and I'd be the nerd in the rowing boat,

74
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,520
 rowing next to them, afraid to get in the ocean.

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,820
 This was my childhood, seriously.

76
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,320
 At the age of 14,

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
 my parents decided that the best way

78
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,460
 to spend a family holiday

79
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,880
 would be at a beach resort in the Seychelles

80
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,540
 in the middle of nowhere,

81
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,000
 a small little island surrounded by water.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
 So we went there,

83
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,940
 and I remember going into the lobby of this hotel,

84
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,500
 and right there on a big board,

85
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,980
 as you came in the lobby, was a sign.

86
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,980
 It said, "Sign up for your one-day scuba diving experience."

87
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,260
 And I thought to myself,

88
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,800
 maybe this is the way to overcome my fear.

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,340
 Maybe if I could just get the courage in me

90
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,980
 to sign up for this one-day scuba diving experience,

91
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,420
 then I would go out into the ocean,

92
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,900
 I would see that the ocean is filled

93
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,540
 with all these beautiful things,

94
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,780
 that it's perfectly safe,

95
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,700
 and this would set me free from my fear.

96
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,620
 So I said to my mom and dad,

97
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,900
 "Can I sign up for the one-day scuba diving?"

98
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,180
 They said, "Are you mad?

99
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,460
 "You're phobic of the ocean."

100
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,540
 I said, "Yes, this is psychology.

101
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,040
 "It's called flooding.

102
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,380
 "You flood yourself with your terror,

103
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,140
 "and you realize that it's not that bad,

104
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,280
 "and you overcome it."

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,080
 My mom was like, "Where do I sign?"

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,220
 (audience laughing)

107
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,660
 They signed me up for my one-day scuba diving experience.

108
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,500
 Now, this experience existed in this way.

109
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,340
 You had a one-hour classroom of lectures.

110
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,700
 You then, for about two and a half hours,

111
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,580
 were gonna scuba dive

112
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,820
 in the bottom of the swimming pool of the resort.

113
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,740
 And then after you've done that, after lunch,

114
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,380
 you would go out on the boat,

115
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,060
 and they would take you out about 200 yards offshore.

116
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,900
 They would drop the anchor rope,

117
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,420
 and what you would do is you would swim down the anchor rope

118
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,000
 into about 30 meters of water,

119
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,700
 swim around for about 20 minutes,

120
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,060
 back up the anchor rope,

121
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,580
 and that was your one-day scuba diving experience.

122
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,940
 The one-hour of classroom lectures

123
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,140
 consisted of this as a summary.

124
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,700
 "When you're in the water,

125
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,400
 "do not have a moment of uncertainty."

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,220
 (audience laughing)

127
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,520
 This was all that I was planning to do in the water,

128
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,680
 was to have lots and lots and lots of moments of uncertainty.

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,260
 We then went into the swimming pool,

130
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,820
 and I discovered in the swimming pool

131
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,780
 that I was actually a really good,

132
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,180
 skills-based scuba diver.

133
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,820
 I could take off my mask,

134
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,740
 put it back on again, and get all the water out.

135
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,460
 I could take my regulator out and sort of swim around a bit

136
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,700
 and then put the regulator back in,

137
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,940
 and I could do all the safety drills that were needed.

138
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,600
 My skills as a scuba diver were good.

139
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,700
 We then had lunch, which consisted of food

140
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,740
 that I do not remember because I did not eat any of it.

141
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,540
 I was so nervous, my stomach was going in knots,

142
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,820
 I couldn't handle it.

143
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,280
 Right after lunch, we stepped down onto the beach

144
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,220
 with all of our scuba gear.

145
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,060
 And I'm standing there, there's the boat,

146
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,740
 and there's this massive ocean in front of me.

147
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
 And I'm thinking to myself,

148
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,080
 this is the worst decision I have ever made.

149
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,180
 And I literally pray, and I say,

150
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,740
 Jesus, if you are Jesus,

151
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,920
 I need some courage to step on this boat.

152
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,820
 Somehow, I got myself on the boat.

153
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,680
 As we start to go out from the shore,

154
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
 they pair us up with a dive buddy,

155
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,340
 something very important.

156
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,740
 I was paired up with a Frenchman

157
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,660
 who was probably about 26, 27 years old.

158
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,220
 I'm an English person who's 14.

159
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,500
 He seemed very old and scary to me.

160
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,140
 And as he's sitting next to me,

161
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,020
 he doesn't speak a lot of English.

162
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,560
 I don't speak much French,

163
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,560
 but he can tell by looking in my eyes, I am terrified.

164
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,940
 And so he's staring at me,

165
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,780
 and I can see that that's making him a little bit,

166
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,980
 like, this is my dive buddy, right?

167
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,980
 He goes, (speaking in French)

168
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,860
 Was that all right?

169
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,680
 Was that French?

170
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,520
 Yeah, all right, okay.

171
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,700
 (audience laughing)

172
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,100
 I don't know what that is in French, but anyway.

173
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,420
 And I was like, okay, all right, all right.

174
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,180
 We get out about 200 yards.

175
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,660
 They let the anchor rope down.

176
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,980
 Everybody starts jumping in the water

177
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,540
 like this is the best day of their lives.

178
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,980
 My French buddy gets in the water

179
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,220
 and he starts to drift out towards the anchor rope.

180
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,860
 I realized that if I don't go now,

181
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,420
 I'm going to leave him to the terrors of the ocean.

182
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,860
 Somehow I get in the water,

183
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,420
 I drift over to the anchor rope,

184
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,100
 and my French friend, he gives me a French thumbs up.

185
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,620
 I don't know what that is, but it was like, voila.

186
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,140
 (speaking in French)

187
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,620
 He starts to go down the anchor rope, right?

188
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,260
 And I'm like, if I don't go now, I'll lose him.

189
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,740
 I might lose my way.

190
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,740
 So mustering all the courage I could find,

191
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,060
 I start to let the air out

192
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,580
 and I start to descend down at the anchor rope.

193
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,540
 I get five meters down

194
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,140
 and I see a movement on my right-hand side.

195
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,740
 Now, when you're scuba diving,

196
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,500
 you can't just go, oh, what's that?

197
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,540
 So I'm there like.

198
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,020
 (audience laughing)

199
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,380
 And a shark swims past me on my right-hand side,

200
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,940
 swims down towards the other scuba divers

201
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,260
 and slowly drifts off into the horizon.

202
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,220
 A shark.

203
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,700
 I've been in the water less than five minutes.

204
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,780
 I haven't been in the water since I was eight years old.

205
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,540
 This classifies as a moment of uncertainty.

206
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,380
 Now, what a brave person would have done

207
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,420
 was to swim down, grab my French buddy,

208
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,140
 tell him, "Shark," you know,

209
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,140
 get him up out of the water and into freedom and safety.

210
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,020
 Sorry, but I let my French guy go.

211
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,420
 I was so overwhelmed.

212
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,020
 I swam as quickly as I could to the surface.

213
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,580
 Luckily, I was only about five meters down,

214
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,660
 so there wasn't any worries.

215
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,860
 I got right to the surface.

216
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,540
 I was panicking.

217
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,500
 I swam as fast as I could back over to the boat.

218
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,780
 The Seychelles boat boy, he grabs me by my arms.

219
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,900
 He yanks me up and he pulls me onto my back on the boat.

220
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,700
 And I rip off my mask and I rip out my regulator

221
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,220
 and I'm about to go, "Shark, shark!"

222
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,980
 And he leans over me and he goes,

223
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,300
 "Hey, man, did you see the dolphin?"

224
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
 (audience laughing)

225
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:19,700
 Dolphin?

226
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,420
 "Hey, man, did you see the dolphin?"

227
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,540
 I don't know why he's Irish.

228
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,900
 He just sounded Irish then.

229
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,700
 I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,540
 "I saw the dolphin.

231
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,860
 "Did you see the, I wanted to come back

232
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,900
 "to make sure you saw the dolphin.

233
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,100
 "Did you see the dolphin?"

234
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,100
 (audience laughing)

235
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,940
 I think it's quite interesting how we humans

236
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,260
 have a tendency to turn dolphins into sharks in our lives.

237
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,180
 We just spent seven weeks looking at a story of Israel

238
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,500
 who, because of fear, turned a dolphin into a shark.

239
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,580
 God had given them this amazing promised land,

240
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,140
 this place for them to go and inhabit

241
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,100
 and to conquer and to take,

242
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,620
 that he had literally rolled out the red carpet for them,

243
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,020
 a place filling with milk and honey,

244
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,980
 grapes that looked of the promises of God.

245
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,220
 And they were so afraid of the giants in the land

246
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,180
 that they came back, those 10 spies,

247
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,860
 with a report that stirred up such fear in the camp

248
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,420
 that they felt like they were going to be devoured

249
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,980
 by the shark in that place.

250
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,740
 I mean, it blows my mind that in my fear,

251
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,580
 God thought the best thing for me,

252
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,980
 let me help Andrew overcome his fear.

253
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,980
 I will send him, literally rolling out the red carpet

254
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,540
 of aquaness, I will send him a dolphin.

255
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,940
 Peace-loving, beautiful, (imitates dolphin)

256
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,780
 dolphin.

257
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,100
 And in my fear, I turned dolphins into sharks

258
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,300
 and we see that Israel suffers in the same way.

259
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,020
 And for 40 years, note this, 40 years,

260
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,340
 that fear has an impact on their lives.

261
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,820
 For 40 years, they have to wait for a whole generation

262
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,940
 to be released from Israel.

263
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,580
 A whole generation that doubted God,

264
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
 rebelled against him because of the fear,

265
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,460
 decided that that wasn't the way it was,

266
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,220
 turned that dolphin into a shark, 40 years,

267
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,580
 that God purges that out of them.

268
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,500
 And at the end of that 40 years,

269
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,500
 Moses is still alive somehow, really old now.

270
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,220
 And he realizes that he's about to die.

271
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,420
 And in the moment of understanding

272
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,220
 that death is right near him,

273
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,380
 the Holy Spirit leads him up a mountain,

274
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,740
 a little bit like how the Holy Spirit led him up a mountain

275
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,820
 of Mount Sinai to receive the law.

276
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,420
 This time, leads him up a mountain called Mount Nebo.

277
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,500
 Mount Nebo is in modern day Jordan.

278
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,460
 And from this mountain, you can look out

279
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,020
 and you can see the promised land.

280
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,860
 In fact, I had the great privilege

281
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,980
 of traveling to Jordan just two years ago,

282
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,980
 and I was able to stand right where Moses stood,

283
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,460
 looking out on the same geographical view

284
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,500
 that he would have seen.

285
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,660
 And I took a photo, I want you to see this.

286
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,020
 This is what it looks like.

287
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,180
 So Moses is standing there and he's looking out

288
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,220
 and you see all the green that is there.

289
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,300
 That's the fertile land, that's Canaan for Moses,

290
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,180
 modern day Israel for us.

291
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,580
 And you can see maybe just,

292
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,460
 if you look at the middle of the screen,

293
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,380
 just a little bit to the right,

294
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,020
 there's a bit of blue dot there.

295
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,180
 That's the Sea of Galilee.

296
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,740
 I mean, you can see all of the incredibleness

297
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,860
 of the Holy Land right there from Mount Nebo.

298
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,380
 And Moses would have looked over there

299
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,540
 and would have realized,

300
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,900
 I am not going to go into that place.

301
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:38,060
 And instead, the Spirit speaks to him

302
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,420
 and he decides that he's going to anoint

303
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,420
 and appoint Joshua to go

304
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,780
 and be the one that would lead Israel into the land.

305
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,180
 Joshua, one of the two spies

306
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,100
 that didn't turn the dolphin into a shark.

307
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,740
 One of the two that went into the land,

308
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,260
 believed the grapes, even though he saw the giants,

309
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,100
 came back with a report and said,

310
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,700
 it is exceedingly good.

311
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,660
 That one who is now 40 years older,

312
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,380
 stands next to Moses

313
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,140
 and I think there's a mixture of feelings on him.

314
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,700
 Like me standing before the ocean that day,

315
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,060
 there's Joshua standing before the River Jordan once again,

316
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,500
 looking onto the beauty of that promised land.

317
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,740
 And I think he's nervous and excited.

318
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,060
 He's conscious of the mistakes

319
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,780
 that had been made in the past.

320
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,500
 And he's filled with excitement

321
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,620
 for what God is about to do in the future.

322
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,260
 I wonder if you've ever felt like you're standing

323
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,860
 in one of those moments in life.

324
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,380
 Joshua's moments.

325
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,700
 Over the last seven weeks,

326
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,740
 as we've looked at numbers 13 and 14,

327
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,700
 we've told you the story of Caleb, haven't we?

328
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,260
 Caleb's been the center character.

329
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,740
 Caleb is the one with the different spirit,

330
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,620
 Caleb and Joshua, but Caleb took center stage

331
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,580
 and we spoke about his wholeheartedness and all of that.

332
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,420
 And that was great.

333
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,020
 But now we're at a point where they're about to cross in

334
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,820
 some 40 years later and the narrative shifts away

335
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,660
 from Caleb.

336
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,260
 In fact, Caleb's hardly heard of again,

337
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
 but Joshua takes center stage now.

338
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,460
 And I want you to see what takes place here.

339
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,820
 You see, wholeheartedness had gotten them

340
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,540
 to the point where they're on the edge of the land,

341
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,420
 but it would be courage and strength

342
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,620
 that would make them conquerors of that land.

343
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,860
 Are you with me?

344
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
 The wholeheartedness got them right there to the edge,

345
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,980
 but it would be courage and strength

346
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,220
 that would bring them in.

347
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,140
 And now Joshua is wondering, how do we take the next step?

348
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,220
 How do we actually move from a place of waiting

349
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,260
 to a place of action?

350
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,860
 I want you to hear this church.

351
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,060
 40 years of waiting.

352
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,540
 And now they're at this moment where waiting must turn

353
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,460
 into action.

354
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,220
 And I believe here in Hong Kong, in the hour that we're in,

355
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,580
 in this moment of our city,

356
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,300
 it's time for us to stop waiting.

357
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,260
 I think waiting finishes and we have to now move forward

358
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,740
 in action.

359
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,660
 And the one thing that we're gonna need

360
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,820
 more than anything else,

361
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,820
 as we step into the place of action, strength and courage.

362
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,060
 I wanna say this right over you, right here at the start.

363
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,420
 I believe God's got something so important

364
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,460
 that is you shaped, you unique.

365
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,260
 And I believe that what he's calling you to

366
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,260
 is so important and so beyond your natural abilities.

367
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,340
 If it wasn't, he wouldn't be calling you into it.

368
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,180
 That you're going to need more strength and courage

369
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,780
 for what's ahead.

370
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,660
 And so I wanna unpack this message for you today

371
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,660
 to help you to understand what strength and courage

372
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,980
 might mean for you in your situation, in your context,

373
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,540
 what it might mean for us as a city

374
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,180
 in our time here in Hong Kong right now.

375
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,540
 Does that sound all right?

376
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,580
 And I wanna go to this passage where God,

377
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,420
 just before Joshua takes his first step,

378
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,540
 says some very important things to him

379
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,060
 about this idea of what strength and courage is.

380
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,260
 This is found in Joshua 1, verse one.

381
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,460
 After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord,

382
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,100
 the Lord said to Joshua, son of Nun, Moses' aid,

383
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,260
 Moses, my servant is dead.

384
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,460
 Now then, you and all these people get ready

385
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,020
 to cross the Jordan River into the land

386
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,340
 that I'm about to give them to the Israelites.

387
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,700
 I will give you every place where you set your foot,

388
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,100
 as I promised Moses.

389
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,860
 Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon,

390
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,700
 from the great river to the great sea on the west.

391
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,100
 No one will be able to stand up against you

392
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,780
 all of the days of your life, for as I was with Moses,

393
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,660
 so I will now be with you.

394
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,800
 I will never leave you or forsake you.

395
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
 I want you to see the important thing

396
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,540
 that God does with Joshua in this moment.

397
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,280
 First of all, he doesn't mince his words.

398
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,200
 He tells him straight up, Moses is dead.

399
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,320
 Now that would have meant something for Joshua.

400
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,480
 That was his mentor, his leader, the one he has followed,

401
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,140
 the one he's obeyed, the one he's actually been an aid to,

402
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,440
 the one he's given his life to.

403
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,280
 God says, that guy can't be your support anymore.

404
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,520
 Moses is dead, but then he says this really important thing.

405
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,360
 He says, now I want you to get ready

406
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,160
 to cross the Jordan River into the land

407
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,440
 that I'm about to give to you, the Israelites.

408
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,560
 He says this, Moses might be dead,

409
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,480
 but the mission I have for you is not dead.

410
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,420
 I want you to follow this.

411
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,840
 The man himself has died,

412
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,200
 but the mission of God has not died with him.

413
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,760
 That God's mission is bigger and broader

414
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,400
 than the individual.

415
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,340
 That's important for some of you to sit here and hear.

416
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,200
 That you might think that everything is formed

417
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
 and shaped around you.

418
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,040
 No, no, God has broader and bigger plans

419
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,940
 than just the one person.

420
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,540
 The vine is not about Andrew.

421
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,560
 This church and your faith is not about your leaders

422
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,120
 or your pastors.

423
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,280
 There is a much bigger, broader thing.

424
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,120
 Moses is dead.

425
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,880
 At some point in the near future,

426
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,900
 I won't be your senior pastor anymore.

427
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,720
 And the anointing and the power will shift to someone else.

428
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,820
 And God's work will continue

429
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,480
 because God has a plan for his people.

430
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,520
 And that plan involves people,

431
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,380
 but is not linked so much to people

432
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,920
 that when those people make mistakes,

433
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
 when those people don't do right,

434
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
 when those people disobey,

435
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,520
 that the whole thing is thwarted.

436
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,040
 Some of you need to realize

437
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,560
 that the mission you're caught up in

438
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,580
 is way bigger than you realize.

439
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,400
 Now, why is that important?

440
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,560
 It's important because what God's doing in this moment

441
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,240
 is he's creating the foundation for Joshua's courage.

442
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,600
 He's basically saying to Joshua,

443
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,800
 it's not about you, buddy.

444
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
 It's not your mission.

445
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,440
 It's not your idea.

446
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,600
 It's not your strength.

447
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,960
 It's not what you're going to do.

448
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,360
 No, it's my mission.

449
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,760
 I've always decreed this.

450
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,560
 40 years ago, I wanted you to do it.

451
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,200
 And out of rebellion, you didn't.

452
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
 And now 40 years it's taken,

453
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,640
 but that mission has not died.

454
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,120
 It's my will, my way.

455
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,200
 Your courage comes from actually realizing

456
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,160
 that it's not about you.

457
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,280
 'Cause if it is in our courage,

458
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,680
 we're gonna have a tendency,

459
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,120
 listen to this,

460
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
 of turning dolphins into sharks.

461
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:27,080
 So God says to Joshua, this is going to happen.

462
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,180
 Are you with me?

463
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,560
 Not only that, but he says, I'm with you.

464
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,920
 We're in this together.

465
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,880
 Partnership moving into the land.

466
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,240
 You see, you need to understand

467
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,560
 that courage always comes from mission.

468
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,280
 In just the same way as faith always comes from challenge.

469
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,480
 Courage is always linked to mission.

470
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,000
 I'm not gonna stand in front of you today

471
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,560
 and ask you to be courageous for courageous sake.

472
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,680
 I'm gonna ask you to be courageous for something.

473
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,240
 And it's that something,

474
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,280
 it's how you define that something

475
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,640
 that'll be the foundation of your courage.

476
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,760
 The thing that wakes you up in the morning

477
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,800
 and you say, I'm a child of God.

478
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,720
 The thing that wakes you up and says,

479
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,600
 I have something to say to this city,

480
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,240
 to my company, to my family, to my spouse.

481
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,280
 The thing that wakes you up in the morning

482
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,280
 and says, because of the gospel, there is hope.

483
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,620
 That something that curves through your veins

484
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,040
 and pumps your blood and makes you excited

485
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,320
 to be alive in Hong Kong

486
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,240
 and a Christian for the gospel and in time.

487
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,720
 That thing, you need to discover what that is.

488
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,480
 'Cause it's that thing where you'll find your courage.

489
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,360
 It's linking that thing to the bigger thing

490
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,080
 that God is at work in that will help you know

491
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,680
 and feel that God is with you.

492
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,760
 Is this making sense?

493
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,600
 You okay?

494
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,440
 Feels really quiet in here.

495
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,360
 Is that all right?

496
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,560
 Good.

497
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,120
 Notice what happens next.

498
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,360
 Thank you, baby.

499
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,660
 Baby's like, yeah, go for it, preach it.

500
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,240
 Verse six, be strong and courageous

501
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,400
 because you will lead these people to inherit the land

502
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,600
 that I swore to their forefathers to give them.

503
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,280
 Be strong and very courageous.

504
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,320
 Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you.

505
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
 Do not turn from it from the right to the left

506
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
 that you may be successful wherever you go.

507
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,800
 Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth.

508
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 Meditate on it day and night

509
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,420
 so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.

510
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,080
 Then you will be prosperous and successful.

511
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,440
 Have I not commanded you?

512
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,640
 Be strong and courageous.

513
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
 Do not be terrified.

514
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,960
 Do not be discouraged for the Lord your God will be with you

515
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,360
 wherever you go.

516
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,440
 Three times, notice this.

517
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,040
 God says to Joshua, be strong and courageous.

518
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,380
 And you need to know, God does not have a speech impediment.

519
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,480
 God is intentionally trying to drill something

520
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,520
 into this young man, well, he's not young, he's old,

521
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
 into this old man,

522
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,880
 it's 'cause I see so many young people in this room.

523
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,000
 He's trying to drill something into this person

524
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,880
 and he's trying to say, you need to be strong and courageous.

525
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,640
 Be strong and courageous, be strong and courageous.

526
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,880
 It's that important.

527
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,440
 And so I stand over you as divine church.

528
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,960
 If you're a part of this church community,

529
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,820
 then there's an authority in this place

530
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,360
 for us to be in relationship spiritually as well.

531
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,200
 I stand over you and I say for Hong Kong, for this hour,

532
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,560
 be strong and courageous.

533
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,040
 Before you take one step,

534
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,680
 find the courage and the strength

535
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,680
 to join me in missions in this hour.

536
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,320
 It was important for him to hear it

537
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,840
 before he took that step.

538
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,980
 I feel in my spirit, it's important for you to hear it.

539
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,580
 There are some of us in this room

540
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:56,120
 who are in danger of turning dolphins into sharks

541
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,080
 because we're still a little bit consumed by the giants.

542
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,880
 God's rolling out a red carpet, I believe, for you

543
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,620
 in whatever it is that God is releasing you into.

544
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,220
 And he's saying, be strong and courageous.

545
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,300
 Do not fear.

546
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,240
 There are three specific things

547
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,520
 that God says to Joshua to be strong and courageous about.

548
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,520
 And I wanna tell you that these three specific things

549
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,560
 are the things that I think all of us

550
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,040
 need to be strong and courageous in,

551
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,520
 regardless of what the something is

552
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,600
 that God has called us to,

553
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,160
 regardless of whatever mission is on you,

554
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,240
 regardless of whatever call is upon your life,

555
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,800
 regardless of whatever's going on in your life right now.

556
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,540
 These three things that God calls Joshua

557
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,360
 to be strong and courageous in

558
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,880
 are, I believe, three fundamental biblical principles

559
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,120
 of things that all of us need to find courage in

560
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,520
 if we're going to move forward

561
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,800
 in the mission of God in our lives.

562
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,400
 Here's the first one, verse six.

563
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,180
 Be strong and courageous

564
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,960
 because you will lead these people to inherit the land

565
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,160
 that I swore to their fathers to give them.

566
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,760
 The first thing is leadership.

567
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,880
 We have to be strong and courageous in leadership.

568
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,300
 And before I say anything else,

569
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,880
 when I talk about leadership,

570
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,200
 I'm not talking about me or my title here at the Vine.

571
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,320
 I'm not talking about the leadership of the Vine Church.

572
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,440
 I'm not talking about your boss in your office.

573
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,000
 I'm not talking about the leader of your family.

574
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,080
 I'm talking about you.

575
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,920
 You are a leader

576
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,640
 'cause God has given you a sphere of influence,

577
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,760
 some place where you have some sort of influence,

578
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,360
 some sort of authority.

579
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,240
 For some of us, it's a big influence and a big authority.

580
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,200
 For some of us, it's a smaller influence

581
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,480
 and a smaller authority.

582
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,520
 God does not look at those two things differently.

583
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,200
 He doesn't think, "Oh, the leaders of more are the better."

584
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,600
 So every single one of us has leadership authority

585
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,280
 because we are the children of God

586
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,360
 living the kingdom of God in the brokenness of this world.

587
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,840
 So I want you to hear leadership about you.

588
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,120
 Now, God turns up to Joshua

589
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,960
 and he understands that Joshua's got a difficult job,

590
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,200
 that leading Israel is not an easy thing.

591
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,440
 And so he comes to him and says,

592
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,760
 "You need strength and courage for your leadership

593
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,840
 in what's ahead."

594
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,280
 I think it's very obvious to us

595
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,760
 that in our world right now,

596
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,040
 we are suffering from a failure of leadership

597
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,920
 over the last couple of years.

598
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,040
 I think if there's one thing

599
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,280
 that this world is really struggling with,

600
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,680
 it is finding good leaders.

601
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,560
 Instead, what's happened is somehow politically,

602
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,480
 somehow within the boardroom,

603
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,240
 somehow we've redefined leadership to be this,

604
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,080
 that leadership now, the characteristics of leadership

605
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,040
 is so often name-calling.

606
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,000
 It's so often character assassination.

607
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,080
 It's so often shaming.

608
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,200
 It's so often manipulation of the media.

609
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,040
 It's so often trying to push people

610
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,920
 to extreme points of view.

611
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 And if you're not on my side of the extreme point of view,

612
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,400
 you're a hater and you're the enemy.

613
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,480
 Leadership has become incredibly divisive.

614
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,360
 And for some reason,

615
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,880
 people think that that's how power is given now.

616
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,640
 And before we as Christians begin to point out too much,

617
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,720
 the speck in everybody else's eyes,

618
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,800
 we need to stop and realize there's a big, huge plank in ours.

619
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,880
 Over the last 2000 years,

620
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,320
 the church has suffered many times

621
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,040
 for a failure of leadership.

622
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,200
 Just in the recent six months,

623
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,480
 we've seen celebrity pastors, famous NGO leaders,

624
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,480
 Christians who have fallen from grace.

625
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,920
 That fall impacts all of us.

626
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,120
 It's hard, isn't it?

627
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,200
 For all of us when we see that.

628
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,440
 And we realize that this failure of leadership

629
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,800
 is happening both in the world,

630
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,560
 it's happening also in the church,

631
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,800
 and we're all a part of it.

632
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,400
 And God is standing over his people and he's saying,

633
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,320
 who's gonna be strong and courageous in leadership?

634
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,680
 I mean, who's gonna be willing to stand

635
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,440
 for godly principles in how they lead in their office,

636
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,040
 in their family, in their school?

637
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,880
 Who's gonna stand for authenticity?

638
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,240
 Who's gonna stand for vulnerability and humility?

639
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,320
 Who's gonna make a stand to love the other as yourself?

640
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,320
 Who's gonna be the first person willing to say, I'm sorry?

641
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,760
 Like who's gonna be willing to step forward

642
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,200
 with the kind of leadership that we see in Jesus Christ?

643
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,440
 That kind of leadership takes a huge amount of courage.

644
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,400
 Because everything else around you is going to tell you

645
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,600
 that the way you get influence and power these days

646
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,800
 is by doing the name calling, and the character assassination

647
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,520
 and manipulating the media and doing all these things.

648
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,600
 And for you to say, no, I actually believe

649
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,240
 with a different spirit that there's a different way.

650
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,760
 That actually maybe if I'm more grace-filled

651
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,920
 and grace-loving, things might change.

652
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,480
 So I think there's people in this room

653
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,600
 where in the very near future,

654
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,200
 you're gonna have to have courage

655
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,520
 to stand up in your boardroom

656
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,840
 and to stand against a policy that puts profit over people.

657
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,600
 Some of you in this room,

658
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 you're gonna have to have the courage

659
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
 to stand in your classroom,

660
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
 or as a parent, stand over your child

661
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,520
 and stand for biblical values that are at threat.

662
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,040
 I think there's some people in this room

663
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,480
 where you're gonna have to stand over that relationship

664
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,600
 that's broken in your life,

665
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,800
 and you're gonna have to exhibit some godly leadership

666
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,760
 and say, you know what?

667
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,720
 I'm also responsible for this breakdown.

668
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,680
 I've made mistakes.

669
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,240
 Would you forgive me

670
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,480
 that there might be a rising up of the church

671
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,480
 to take on an idea of what strong and courageous leadership

672
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,800
 might truly look like?

673
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,720
 Let me put it this way.

674
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,920
 If we have any hope of moving the needle in Hong Kong

675
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,160
 and helping this city heal from all of its pain

676
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,600
 over the last couple of years,

677
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,640
 if we have any hope of seeing people come together

678
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
 in this city in more unity,

679
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,080
 any hope of being able to build a new character

680
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,560
 and a new identity for Hong Kong in the years ahead,

681
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,800
 it will come if we rise up

682
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,880
 with a strong and courageous leadership

683
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,600
 that holds boldly forth the idea of integrity and hope

684
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
 that is found in the person of Jesus.

685
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,280
 Like we are being called right now in this hour

686
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,520
 to hold forth that kind of hope.

687
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,480
 Where are the leaders?

688
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,040
 They're sitting in this room.

689
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,920
 Be strong and courageous.

690
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,440
 Here's the second thing.

691
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,080
 Verse seven, be strong and very courageous.

692
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,640
 Be careful to obey all that the law

693
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,960
 my servant Moses has given you.

694
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,840
 Do not turn from the right or to the left

695
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,920
 that you may be successful wherever you go.

696
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,200
 Do not let this book of law depart from your mouth.

697
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,080
 Meditate it day and night

698
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,720
 so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.

699
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,560
 Then you'll be prosperous and successful.

700
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,520
 The second thing you're going to need strength

701
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,000
 and courage in is obedience.

702
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 It's going to be really difficult to remain obedient

703
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,800
 to the ways of Jesus in this fast changing world

704
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,640
 that we're in.

705
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,600
 And God understood for Joshua

706
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
 that disobedience had led Israel

707
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,680
 into a 40 year wandering in the wilderness.

708
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,640
 A 40 year of wandering around

709
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,840
 before they were ready to go in.

710
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,640
 And God knew that if there was one thing

711
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,920
 that he needs courage in, it is to be obedient.

712
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,360
 Obedient to God's word, obedient to God's promises.

713
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,760
 He wants to speak that life into him.

714
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,240
 Notice God doesn't ask him to be more obedient.

715
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,440
 God challenges him to have courage in his obedience.

716
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,880
 And this is so important for all of us

717
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,920
 because I think in some ways

718
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,280
 that's where we need the courage

719
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,680
 to actually stand for what it is that we believe.

720
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,000
 To actually stand for the things of Christ

721
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,480
 in a broken world.

722
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,080
 To actually offer the obedience to the Lord

723
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,000
 despite whether that obedience might lose that promotion,

724
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,960
 might cause us to lose some friends.

725
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,720
 Obedience to Christ takes courage.

726
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,160
 And it takes courage in this world like never before.

727
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,160
 Christ is gonna call you at some point in the near future

728
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,320
 to let go of things that are ugly in you

729
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,920
 that you don't wanna let go of.

730
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,800
 That will take courage.

731
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
 God's gonna call you in this near future

732
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,600
 to take a stand for the gospel

733
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,240
 when it seems that that's now socially unacceptable to do.

734
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,280
 That will take courage from you.

735
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,800
 Some of us might lose jobs

736
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,920
 because we hold on to values and morals

737
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,200
 that are contrary to what our companies are doing.

738
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,080
 That will take courage from you.

739
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,000
 And I've been saying this for this whole year,

740
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,760
 I'm gonna keep saying it.

741
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,160
 When you're in the reality of the worst moment of your life,

742
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,520
 somebody else's faith is not gonna cut it for you.

743
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,120
 It's your faith and the courage that you have

744
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,080
 to take a moral stand, a spiritual stand,

745
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,560
 a stand in faith and say,

746
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,720
 this is what I believe God's doing in this city

747
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,240
 and I will align all of myself to it.

748
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,320
 So where does the courage come from

749
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,080
 to be obedient to God like that?

750
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,120
 Well, notice what Moses says in verse,

751
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,480
 sorry, Joshua says here in verse eight.

752
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,760
 Oh God, actually.

753
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,920
 Do not let this book of the Lord depart from your mouth.

754
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,000
 Meditate on it day and night

755
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,760
 so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.

756
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,920
 God says, this is where your courage comes from,

757
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,040
 knowing the word.

758
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,040
 Like I'm not asking you to fabricate some courage,

759
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,440
 but if you're gonna have courage

760
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,880
 to be obedient to what I'm saying,

761
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,320
 that courage is gonna come from knowing what I'm saying,

762
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,960
 from understanding my heart, understanding my promises,

763
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,760
 making those, meditating on those,

764
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
 thinking about them, praying about them,

765
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
 using them on your lips,

766
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,720
 speaking them out over one another,

767
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,040
 standing in front of each other,

768
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,600
 reminding each other of gospel stories of a centurion

769
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,240
 who can change your life.

770
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,480
 Like these are the things, meditate, speak

771
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,040
 on the word of God.

772
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,600
 You will need courage in the years ahead here in Hong Kong.

773
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,880
 And your courage will come from your dependency

774
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,280
 and familiarity of God's word.

775
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,960
 We've done like five messages this year

776
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,080
 about the scriptures and the importance of God's word.

777
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,400
 I wonder if you're seeing a repetitive theme

778
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,280
 here at the Vine.

779
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,200
 It's time for us to know it, soak in it, read it,

780
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
 memorize it, have it,

781
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,200
 because the sword of the spirit will be needed,

782
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,720
 which is the word of God.

783
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,200
 Be strong and very courageous.

784
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,040
 Here's the third and final one.

785
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,880
 Verse nine, "Have I not commanded you?

786
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,080
 "Be strong and courageous.

787
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,120
 "Do not be terrified, do not be discouraged,

788
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,160
 "for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.

789
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,680
 "Do not fear and do not be discouraged."

790
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,800
 Two things that God is saying to Joshua,

791
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
 you need courage, not to be fearful,

792
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,840
 courage, not to be discouraged.

793
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,040
 Now, I dealt with fear a few weeks ago in this series.

794
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,720
 I did a whole message on the fear cycle, the faith cycle.

795
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,620
 I'm not gonna speak about fear this morning,

796
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,800
 but if that's something that you didn't hear,

797
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,560
 go back online, grab it and listen to it.

798
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,560
 I wanna talk now then briefly about discouragement.

799
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,160
 We don't talk about this a lot, I don't think,

800
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,880
 in the church, but discouragement has such an impact on us.

801
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,400
 Discouragement happens when you've made a mistake

802
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,200
 and you feel bad about it,

803
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,000
 where you have regrets of things that you've done

804
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,680
 in the past and those regrets begin to shape

805
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,440
 who you are in the present.

806
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,160
 Discouragement is like a heaviness that comes upon you,

807
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,160
 like you're wearing some big, heavy cloak.

808
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,800
 And God shows up to Joshua,

809
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,760
 and God knows that in Joshua's life,

810
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,480
 he has suffered discouragement.

811
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,120
 He knows that Joshua has been with the people

812
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,360
 wandering for 40 years.

813
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,640
 He knows that Joshua has made mistakes in his past,

814
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,080
 that Joshua is not perfect.

815
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,320
 And he knows that those mistakes

816
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,520
 are trying to hold him back.

817
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,640
 You see, I think God realizes

818
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,440
 that the brokenness of Joshua's past

819
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,660
 has the potential to hold him back

820
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,320
 from the freedom of his future.

821
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,240
 And so God comes to Joshua and says,

822
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,040
 "You need to have courage

823
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,980
 "in overcoming your discouragement."

824
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,480
 So let me preach on this for one moment,

825
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
 because I think this is important

826
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,140
 for some people in this room.

827
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,020
 It's like you're carrying around sadness and regret

828
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,900
 and guilt and shame from stuff that you've done in your past.

829
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,300
 And that is now coloring who you are today

830
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,700
 and the direction you're going in the future.

831
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700
 And guess what?

832
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,940
 It is not easy to let go of your past.

833
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,060
 It will take courage for you

834
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,060
 to overcome the heaviness of your mistakes.

835
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,420
 It's gonna take great courage for you

836
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,060
 to be able to overcome the heaviness

837
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,100
 of the mistakes that you've made.

838
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
 But I tell you, the number one thing

839
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,520
 that will move you into freedom

840
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,740
 is not to walk into your future facing backwards,

841
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,820
 looking back on all the stuff that's broken and wrong

842
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,260
 and done and thinking that you're on plan B.

843
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,880
 The number one thing that will release you

844
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,180
 into God's mission is the courage

845
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,120
 to let go of what you don't need.

846
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,300
 Let me say it this way.

847
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,300
 The first step in getting what God needs

848
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,340
 is having the courage to let go of what God doesn't.

849
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,140
 Come on, church.

850
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:58,100
 The courage to let go of what God doesn't need in your life.

851
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,460
 The things that you're carrying

852
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,300
 that he's long forgiven you for.

853
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,420
 The things that you're still dragging around

854
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,180
 that he's like, "Why is that still with you?

855
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,820
 "That is gone, whiter than snow.

856
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,020
 "I've washed you clean.

857
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,220
 "Yeah, that was a bad thing.

858
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,460
 "Yes, there are consequences.

859
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,260
 "I've wiped it out of my memory.

860
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,860
 "You are moving forward now,

861
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,060
 "forgiven and restored as a person of Christ."

862
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,140
 And I wonder whether we would have the courage

863
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:26,720
 to not let the enemy win with discouragement.

864
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,780
 Some of you are sitting here and you're like,

865
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,720
 "Wow, that sounds like a lot of work."

866
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,660
 And you're so discouraged,

867
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,020
 and I felt like this sometimes in my life,

868
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,840
 so I understand this.

869
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,220
 You're so discouraged that you don't even know how to start.

870
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,660
 You don't even know if you have the energy to start.

871
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,100
 "Wow, it sounds like a lot, Andrew,

872
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,360
 "to have to face the brokenness of my past,

873
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,220
 "have to allow all those emotions to come,

874
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,660
 "have to give that to God.

875
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,780
 "That sounds like a huge amount of work."

876
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,700
 And you know what?

877
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,140
 There is a process often in finding freedom

878
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,420
 from the things that have so oppressed us.

879
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,420
 But I read a quote this week that really encouraged me.

880
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,420
 I hope it encourages you.

881
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,580
 Let me read this to you.

882
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,940
 "Courage doesn't always roar.

883
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,120
 "Sometimes courage is the quiet voice

884
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,560
 "at the end of the day saying,

885
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,100
 "'I will try again tomorrow.'"

886
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,820
 Isn't that beautiful?

887
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,360
 Like, "I'm gonna get back in the water

888
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,620
 "with my scuba gear the next day,

889
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,880
 "and I'm gonna really try my best

890
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,820
 "to not turn a dolphin into a shark.

891
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,640
 "I will take courage that I'm working on a mission

892
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,280
 "that is God's mission, not mine."

893
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,200
 And as Joshua is trying to let go of his discouragement,

894
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,200
 I want you to see where he can find the hope to do that.

895
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,400
 Right at the end of verse nine,

896
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,840
 "God will be with you wherever you go,

897
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,200
 "no matter what's going on for you,

898
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,500
 "no matter where you are, I will be with you.

899
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,520
 "Feeling completely in despair, I will be there.

900
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
 "Struggling with the pain of your mistakes,

901
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,800
 "I will meet you there.

902
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,180
 "Holding back on your depression,

903
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,000
 "not knowing how to move forward with joy,

904
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,840
 "I'll meet you there.

905
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,920
 "Upset because you cheated on your spouse

906
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,740
 "and you've never really dealt with the guilt of it,

907
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,580
 "I will be there for you.

908
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,460
 "But you will need to be courageous

909
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,340
 "to maybe admit some things,

910
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,940
 "reconcile some things, bring your hurt to me."

911
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,380
 So God turns to Joshua and he says,

912
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,020
 "The hope will come because I haven't given up on you.

913
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,400
 "I haven't left you, I haven't forsaken you.

914
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,400
 "I'm right here with you, so be strong and courageous."

915
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,680
 There's a moment in the New Testament

916
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,080
 where the disciples are really struggling.

917
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,220
 They've watched their best friend murdered on a cross.

918
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,220
 They've seen him raised, they've talked to him.

919
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,100
 They've heard his hope for them.

920
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,940
 They know he's about to ascend up into the heavens,

921
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,260
 but they're struggling with the reality of what comes next.

922
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,260
 What do we do when our risen Savior is no longer with us?

923
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,180
 And I want to read you some words

924
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,700
 that Jesus speaks over his fearful disciples.

925
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,940
 He brings them up a mountain,

926
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,620
 much like Moses and Joshua standing on a mountain

927
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,180
 overlooking the promised land.

928
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,560
 Jesus brings the disciples up to a mountain

929
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,220
 so that they could look over the Greco-Roman Empire.

930
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,300
 And here's what he says to them in Matthew 28.

931
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,940
 He says, "All authority in heaven and earth

932
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,040
 "has been given to me.

933
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,380
 "So now go and make disciples of all nations,

934
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,780
 "baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son

935
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,900
 "and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey

936
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,420
 "everything I have commanded you.

937
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,780
 "And surely I am with you always

938
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,780
 "to the very end of the age."

939
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,740
 I wonder if that sounds like anything.

940
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,900
 That God shows up to Joshua and says,

941
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,060
 I want you to move forward.

942
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,140
 Be strong and courageous as you lead.

943
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,420
 Be strong and courageous as you experience obedience.

944
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,140
 Be strong and courageous to overcome your fear,

945
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,380
 overcome your discouragement.

946
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,940
 I will always be with you.

947
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,020
 So Jesus stands in front of the disciples

948
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,980
 and in relation stands in front of you and I

949
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,540
 here in Hong Kong in this hour.

950
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,060
 And he says, "You too be strong and courageous

951
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,740
 "for there's a mission also for you.

952
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,940
 "Go into the world, make disciples."

953
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,380
 That's my mission.

954
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,980
 It's bigger than any one person.

955
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,500
 It's bigger than any one church,

956
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
 but in partnership together, we can go.

957
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,460
 Go into that world, make disciples,

958
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,420
 teach them to obey, baptize them,

959
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,220
 immerse them in the character of the Father,

960
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
 the Son and the Holy Spirit.

961
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,660
 And as you do that, guess what?

962
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,420
 I will be with you.

963
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,900
 So be strong and courageous.

964
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:32,100
 As we finish this series, we don't finish the mission.

965
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,980
 We start it.

966
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,860
 And this is your moment to step up and step forward,

967
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,780
 to move from waiting to action.

968
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,580
 The Holy Spirit would say, "Be strong and courageous."

969
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,620
 Would you stand with me?

970
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,660
 I wanna pray for you.

971
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:57,660
 And I wanna encourage you if you're comfortable

972
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,940
 just to open your hands as I pray.

973
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,220
 I wanna commission you for the something

974
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,500
 that is in your life.

975
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,380
 For that thing that you are a leader on

976
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
 and over in your life.

977
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,140
 For that thing that gets you up in the morning,

978
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,420
 for that thing that makes you excited,

979
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,980
 for the joy that sits in you,

980
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,740
 for that call for the mission of God

981
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,260
 to go into the world and make disciples.

982
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,260
 And whatever that may manifest in your workplace

983
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,420
 or in your family or in your community,

984
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,420
 you have a unique God-shaped passion on you

985
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,500
 that no one else can do and fulfill.

986
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,420
 And so I stand before you today.

987
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:46,740
 And as God stands over you, He says, "Lead well."

988
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:53,060
 He says, "Obey my word."

989
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:58,420
 And He says to you, "Overcome fear and discouragement."

990
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,300
 "Be strong and courageous."

991
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,620
 Father, our hands are open before you,

992
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,820
 your people in this city, in this place, in this hour.

993
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,540
 Father, I pray as we finish the series

994
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,540
 that you would release over each person right now

995
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:24,740
 the courage to stand for you in a broken world.

996
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,620
 I pray you would release the courage

997
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,340
 to lead in ways that honor the gospel.

998
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,300
 I pray, Lord, you would give each person in this room

999
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:38,300
 the courage to stand for you when others aren't.

1000
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,540
 I pray, Lord, you give the people in this room

1001
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,100
 the courage to not turn dolphins into sharks,

1002
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,060
 the courage to leave behind their regrets

1003
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,220
 and their shame and their failures

1004
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,620
 and to move forward, not perfect, but forgiven.

1005
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,340
 Father, fill them with courage.

1006
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,580
 Father, fill them with your courage.

1007
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,620
 Bring them alive in joy and boldness

1008
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,500
 and the authority that comes from the Holy Spirit.

1009
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:15,620
 Send them into their workplaces and schools,

1010
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
 into their families, into their communities,

1011
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,020
 their spheres of influence,

1012
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:25,020
 with a boldness that holds forth the gospel for this time.

1013
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,260
 We will not be afraid.

1014
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,420
 We will not be afraid.

1015
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,780
 We will see the grapes.

1016
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,300
 Holy Spirit, we will repent when we need to.

1017
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,300
 God, we want the whole of our hearts to be with you.

1018
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,740
 Father, we want to know you, be in relationship with you

1019
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,260
 more than the things that we do, Lord.

1020
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,420
 And we need strength and courage for the fight.

1021
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,300
 So fill us again with faith.

1022
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,900
 (gentle music)

1023
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,700
 Allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you now.

1024
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,280
 (gentle music)
