[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   It's so good that you are here.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.240]   Welcome to The Vine.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.240]   This is your first time.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.240]   We're glad you're with us.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.480]   My name is Andrew, one of the pastors here.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.520]   And it is great to be in God's presence.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.420]   And like Promise so beautifully reminded us, he is in this house, he is in this place,
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.520]   but he's not just in this place.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.120]   And we're going to spend the next four weeks opening up for us some of the ways in which
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:31.920]   God is in a place in us that we desperately need, but so often never talk about.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.400]   I want to sit with something with you over the next four weeks.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.120]   It's a little bit like that prayer we just prayed.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.720]   You know that prayer of God, whatever you want to in my life, is a prayer that Jesus
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.100]   prayed.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.560]   It's a prayer that so many people prayed in scripture.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:57.120]   It's that prayer that opens us up for a profound work and a move by the body of Christ in us.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.520]   And I want to start it by saying some words over you that I think are really important
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.800]   for you to hear this morning, and it's this.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.600]   It is okay for you not to be okay.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.440]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.960]   It is okay to not be okay.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.520]   I heard those words spoken over me by my counselor whilst I was sitting in his office, slumped
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.980]   on his therapist's couch, overwhelmed and struggling with the reality that I had chronic
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.360]   anxiety in my life.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.920]   Three months prior to that, I was sitting in a meeting in the investment bank that I
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.520]   was working in at the time, and I was sitting in a meeting that I'd sat in many, many times
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.520]   before, and as I'm sitting in that meeting, I suddenly am overwhelmed with a sense of
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.900]   panic.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.200]   Suddenly out of the blue, I'm overwhelmed with a sense of anxiety that rises up inside
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.160]   of me, and I didn't expect it.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.640]   I'd never experienced it before.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.900]   I didn't know exactly what was happening.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.320]   My heart rate increased.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.400]   My body temperature soared.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.120]   I wanted to get out of that room as quickly as possible.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.520]   I had to sit through that meeting.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.680]   I don't know how I got through that meeting.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.560]   I got outside straightaway afterwards.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.200]   I paced around the office.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.880]   I was trying to find some way to find the ground under my feet again, and my thought
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.560]   was, "Well, I don't really know what's happening here, but I guess this is just a moment I
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.480]   need to get through."
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.000]   I wonder how many of us in this room have faced an overwhelming and emotional attack
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   on us and have thought, "This is just a moment I need to get through," but it wasn't a moment
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.600]   for me.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.920]   I woke up the next day with exactly the same feeling, and the day after that, and the day
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   after that, and the day after that.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.440]   The feeling was this rising sense of fear in me for something is going to happen in
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.080]   my future, which is going to be a calamity.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.440]   I couldn't quite put my mind on that.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.960]   I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I woke up every morning feeling like something
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.240]   terrible is about to happen.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.160]   This was incredibly painful.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.180]   What it meant was that I was fighting the whole day to try to get my body and my emotions
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.180]   in mind.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.240]   Because I was so tense, I would get home at night and collapse into bed, exhausted physically
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.240]   from the emotional battle that was happening inside of me.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.720]   This was day in and day out.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.560]   I told no one about it, because you don't, do you?
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.240]   You don't want everybody else to think you're weak, that you're not strong enough.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.000]   This is particularly how you think when you work in an investment bank.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.160]   I was there, and I was like, "I don't want any of my colleagues to know that I'm weak
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   here.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.880]   I don't want any of my colleagues to know that I'm out of control.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.680]   We're here as a bank.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.840]   We've got to show ourselves to be sturdy and faithful and committed and professional and
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840]   true."
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   And all these things were what I was projecting outwardly, but inwardly I was being torn up
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.960]   inside.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.760]   And I was fearful of letting my colleagues know how I felt for how they would judge me
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.280]   and think that I was weak.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.360]   I was also fearful from telling people because of pride, pride inside of myself that said,
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.440]   "This is what those with mental health problems suffer.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.120]   This is not people like me who suffer these things, people who are successful, people
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.480]   who are professional, people who work in great companies.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.000]   No, we don't suffer this stuff.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.040]   That's for the other people."
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.880]   That pride kept my mouth shut when I desperately needed someone to help me.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.060]   About a month into it, I turned to my beautiful wife, Christine, and I finally had the courage
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.200]   to tell her what was happening.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.240]   My wife is now a counselor, but in those days she wasn't.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.040]   She said straight away to me, "You need to get help.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.160]   You need to seek professional help."
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.280]   And my response was, "No, that's what people with mental health issues do.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.280]   They go to counselors.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.360]   And if I go to a counselor, that's admitting something that I'm not prepared to admit.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.440]   If I go to a counselor, that's what you do when you're out of control.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.360]   That's what you do when you have no other solutions.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.320]   That's what you do when you're at the end of your rope."
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.080]   And so for the next month, I tried to manage my anxiety through a whole bunch of healthy
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.960]   and mostly really unhealthy ways.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.000]   At the end of that month, I'm still struggling.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.200]   I'm still overwhelmed.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.560]   I'm still barely making it through the day, but I finally asked a friend for a referral
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.120]   to a counselor, and I find myself in his office, slumped on his couch.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.600]   And the first thing he says to me after I've explained to him how I've been suffering for
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.680]   two months is, "It's okay, you know, to not be okay."
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.240]   That started me on a two-year journey of trying to deal with the anxiety in my life through
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.040]   therapy, hard work, a lot of prayer, many times turning to Jesus, incredible support
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:54.160]   of my wife and the church here, seasons of medication to keep my chemical balance in
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.960]   my body and my mind right, fighting a good fight.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.440]   And I stand before you today, and I can say that anxiety is still a co-passenger on the
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.800]   journey of my life.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.360]   It's still something that I'm struggling with right now.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.920]   In fact, I felt anxious before this service.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.640]   It's still something that is a reality to me.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:23.720]   I may not be crippled by it like I was in that first time and in those two years, but
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.960]   anxiety is still a part of my daily journey.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.840]   It's still something that I have to bring constantly to the feet of Jesus.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.200]   And I wonder whether you in this room, you might be resonating with something like this.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.400]   Maybe you haven't had a similar journey to me, but maybe you've experienced times in
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.040]   your life of emotional exhaustion, times in your life where things are just overwhelming
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.040]   you.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.000]   Maybe over the last two to three years as we've all gone through COVID, when we felt
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.200]   more and more out of control, maybe you felt like you were grasping at straws and you felt
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.120]   like you were wondering why you were suddenly feeling fear and anxiety or depression or
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.080]   sadness in ways that you'd never felt before.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.960]   And the reality is that as the world has emerged from COVID, we're all struggling with something
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.360]   that people are generally not speaking about, and that's mental health.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.880]   I mean, around the world right now, we're seeing a mental health crisis, and I would
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.980]   say here without overstating it, that Hong Kong is struggling with a mental health crisis
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.180]   right now, and people are generally not really talking about it.
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.000]   In fact, there's a number of NGOs here that do work in this area that are desperately
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.920]   trying to get the conversation going around the realities of mental health and how we
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.440]   can get help in that space.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.120]   And over the last year, they produced a lot of research and reports, and I want to share
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.000]   you a few things today to help you understand, I think, the context that we're in in Hong
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.880]   Kong at this time.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.480]   One of these NGOs created a research project, and in that research project, they basically
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:55.800]   said about 61% of Hong Kong adults are currently suffering from a low sense of mental well-being,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.120]   61% of Hong Kong people.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.940]   They also said in this that one in seven Hong Kong adults will at some point in their lives
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:14.980]   develop a diagnosed and understood mental health disorder, one in seven.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:21.940]   Another NGO did a research over 1,000 people taken at random across a broad spectrum of
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.420]   the socionomic demographic here in Hong Kong, and here's what they found.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.460]   They found that there was about, I think it was around about 56% of the people that they
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:37.820]   surveyed who actually came out low on the World Health Organization mental wellness
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.820]   spectrum.
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.900]   So the World Health Organization has a spectrum for understanding how mental health is, and
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.420]   out of this survey of 1,000 random people in Hong Kong, 56% of them would rank low on
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.420]   that spectrum.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:58.080]   48% of them admitted to feeling either mild to severe symptoms of depression.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.380]   But here was the overwhelmingly sobering statistic.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:10.300]   Out of all of these people that were interviewed, 74% of them said they would not ever seek
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.460]   professional help.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.700]   Need to think about this, guys, because this is how we define a mental health crisis.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.660]   We have a rising mental health reality and issue in our city, and we have a society that
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:31.240]   over 74% of us will refuse to seek professional help.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.200]   That should concern us as a society.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.020]   That should concern us in the church, but often it doesn't, because when we hear statistics
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.580]   like that, we think, "Oh, yeah, that's what all the people without faith stuff are with."
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.180]   But us with faith, we're awesome.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.180]   We're good.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.180]   God's with us.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.180]   It's all cool, right?
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:55.220]   And the reality is our statistics will be as bad, if not worse, than those.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.420]   See here's the reality.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:03.300]   Mental health is one of the least talked about topics in the global church today.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.180]   Not only that, but those that struggle with mental health in church communities are one
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.980]   of the most marginalized and poorly treated communities within churches.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:20.260]   See, we're not talking about it, therefore we're not responding to it.
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:26.540]   And if we're not responding to it, then we're not being an option in society to how actually
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.500]   mental health could be understood, could be recognized, could be met, and potentially
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.140]   over time, people could be free of some of these things that they struggle with.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:43.740]   And yet as a church, we've generally taken the route of saying spiritual issues are far
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.140]   more important than mental and emotional ones.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:51.780]   And I want to say this, that is not good enough.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.060]   Come on, church.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.780]   That is not good enough.
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:03.020]   It's not good enough because contrary to the apathy seen in the church, the Bible is filled
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.060]   with stories of people struggling with mental health issues.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.780]   In fact, you look through the pages of the Old Testament and the New Testament, you'll
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:17.500]   see people struggling, suffering under physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual issues in
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   their lives.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:24.300]   And in fact, some of the most important figures in Scripture are men and women who struggle
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:30.060]   with fear, struggle with anxiety, struggle with depression, people who struggle with
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.220]   having a positive attitude towards the future.
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.100]   And if you're sitting in this room here right now and any of those things are something
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.100]   that you're aware of, if any of those things are a part of your general experience of life,
[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:48.020]   then you're in good hands because some of the greatest leaders of faith have been some
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.260]   of the people that have struggled the most.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.420]   You guys okay?
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.780]   So in the next four weeks, I want to take you on a bit of a journey.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.220]   I want to open up some of this reality to us of mental health and what that means for
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.220]   us.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.820]   And I want us obviously to do this through a lens of Scripture and through a lens of
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.620]   the Spirit of God.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:15.220]   And I want to start by sharing four things that I think the church is doing wrong in
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.420]   this area that I think we need to address.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.200]   The first is this.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:26.820]   When it comes to mental health, how so often it is thought about, we are tempted to think
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:34.700]   about it primarily as a mental thing impacting our brain that we need to find some diagnosis
[00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:38.980]   for so that we can solve it and get well again.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.740]   When we think of mental health, we're tempted to largely think about it from an issue of
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.100]   this person has this diagnosis, therefore, they need to do this to get well.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.460]   Now, don't hear me wrong.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.740]   Diagnosing mental health conditions is an important part of the process.
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.660]   But when that is the primary lens through which it's viewed, people end up being labeled
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.060]   by their diagnosis.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.300]   We come to actually expect or speak of people as their identity is this.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.500]   This person is depressed.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.900]   And we kind of make something like that the biggest part of who they are.
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.420]   This Bible does not speak about mental health in these kind of categories.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.820]   When the Bible approaches the topic of mental health, it actually doesn't approach it from
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820]   the topic of diagnosis.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.140]   It approaches it from the topic of persons and a theology of suffering.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.420]   In other words, what it says is that our mental anguish and our emotional struggles are a
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:37.540]   part of a bigger and broader thing of our suffering in general, and God cares about
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.860]   our suffering.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.380]   The Bible looks at us as persons.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.280]   And because He looks at us as persons, He looks at us holistically.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.220]   And when He does that, I am not a diagnosis to God.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.900]   Can I have an amen?
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.700]   I'm not a diagnosis to God.
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.700]   I'm a person whom He loves, who He died for, so that I would know the fullness of His power
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.700]   and His resurrection spirit in me.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:04.940]   And when He sees me, He sees the totality of me and my mental health journey, my challenges
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.140]   in that area are a part of the wholeness of who I am.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:15.420]   And God has compassion for me, and He sees me in my suffering, and He meets me in it.
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.100]   When we put mental health in this broader picture of suffering, we learn two things.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:26.180]   God cares about it, and God wants us to talk about it and deal with it amongst ourselves.
[00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.580]   He wants us to be communal in it.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.820]   All suffering that we experience, God is in it and present with it.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.300]   He has compassion for it.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:41.660]   He cares about it, and He wants the community of the body of Christ to be each other's best
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.500]   support.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.660]   So rather than being this kind of black and white mental diagnostic thing, within Scripture
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.140]   it becomes so much more a part of the way we've been created to be as human beings,
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:58.580]   made in the image of God, and a God who cares and loves and creates us and meets us personally
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.580]   in whatever journey we're in.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.140]   Here's the second thing.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.620]   The Bible is not a diagnostic manual.
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:10.380]   It is not designed for us to go into it with any mental health issue and try to find one
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.500]   cural prayer that if we prayed this thing, everything else is going to be fine.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.260]   If we can just find that one prayer in the Bible that sets me fine again, then I need
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.100]   to find that prayer and I need to pray it.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.380]   The Bible doesn't approach this issue that way, and I think many times in Scripture and
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.180]   many times in the church, we actually encourage people to do that, and what happens is they
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:34.580]   go into the Bible looking for some diagnostic help, but actually the Bible doesn't provide
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.060]   that, and therefore they become even more distant with God in the midst of the suffering
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.740]   that they've already got.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.780]   Are you with me?
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.780]   Here's the third thing.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.620]   Perhaps the most important.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:52.380]   We need to stop saying and thinking that all mental health is the result of somebody's
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.240]   sin.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.640]   Is God's punishment for the things that they have done in their past or that they're currently
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.140]   doing right now?
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:07.980]   See, so often in the church, we have this idea, this thought in us that mental health,
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:11.220]   if somebody is suffering from mental health, it's because there must be some sin going
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.380]   on in their life or some sin that they haven't repented of, and if they only just repented,
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.660]   then everything would be fine again.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.420]   See, the reason why we do this is because Christians in particular, but human beings
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:28.140]   in a broader sense, want to find simplistic answers to complex problems, and mental health
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.780]   is a complex issue.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.820]   It's so complex, but we want to find a simple answer to it, so if we can funnel it all down
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.220]   to sin, then we can place sin in a box, and we know how to deal with sin.
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.100]   It's just repent, and then everything will be fine.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:49.820]   Here's the reality that we have to grapple with, that mental health is an incredibly
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:57.340]   complex issue, and the majority of mental health challenge that comes, comes not because
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.540]   of sin, but because of trauma.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.580]   Listen to this, church.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:10.780]   It happens because of trauma, and on the whole, trauma is something that happens to you.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.900]   This does not mean, of course, that our sin cannot create trauma for us.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.900]   Your sin and your poor choices can create trauma that will bring you into a mental health
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.420]   challenge, absolutely, but the majority of mental health challenge that we suffer with
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:31.620]   is because of a trauma that has happened because something is actually out of our control,
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.740]   and because it's out of our control, our thinking and our feelings are overwhelmed because we
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.540]   can't control this thing.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.860]   Human beings love to be in control, and when we're out of control, that brings us into
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.220]   a place where mentally and emotionally we're in anguish and we're suffering.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:53.180]   It's trauma rather than specifically sin.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:18:02.900]   You see, when the Bible talks about suffering, it does so by focusing not so much on sin,
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:10.180]   but on a pathway of God in our suffering who meets us in it and works us through it into
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.860]   a place of hope and health again.
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.460]   So the Bible's focus, when it talks about suffering, is actually not to speak about
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460]   sin.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.960]   Yes, there are some places in Scripture where that happens, but if you look at the totality
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.380]   of the Bible's discussion on suffering, the focus is not sin.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:31.580]   The focus is actually on a pathway of God meeting us in our suffering, walking us through
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.100]   it and bringing us to hope.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.980]   In other words, the focus on this issue is always towards hope.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:43.540]   And if that's the case, then I think the church should focus on the things that the Bible
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.700]   focuses on in this area.
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.140]   Here's the fourth and final thing.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:54.020]   The depth of your faith will not determine your success or failure in this area.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.260]   Oh, come on, church.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.960]   The depth of your faith is not going to impact the success or failure in this area.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   We so often think this in the church.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.580]   We think that strong people of faith will not suffer mental health issues.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.700]   And therefore, what we're implying is that those that struggle with mental health issues
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.580]   are actually the weak ones of faith.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.140]   I need you to hear this because it's really, really important.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.100]   A mental health challenge is not a weakness of faith.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:30.780]   It is a situation you are experiencing within which your faith can help you to navigate.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.580]   Come on, church.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.580]   Somebody please be here.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.580]   Are you here?
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.860]   Are you with me?
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.420]   It's not a weakness of faith, but your faith can help, of course, as you journey in that
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.580]   process of struggling with mental health and wanting to move to that place of hope as you
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.180]   understand God's with you.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.020]   Faith can help you to navigate, but your reality of the mental health condition you might be
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.420]   facing is not a lack of your faith.
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:54.940]   It is not that you are weak.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:03.380]   Someone said to me two weeks ago that true Christians cannot become depressed.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:10.100]   And this sits at the heart of why this is an issue in the church and why over the next
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.620]   four weeks we're going to break some of those taboos and we're going to speak about it.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.980]   And I want to do that today by taking you to an intro.
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.940]   I want to introduce a bit around this topic and a bit around my journey in this topic
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.500]   by taking you to a passage that I think is really, really important to help us to begin
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.700]   to fully understand what God does in the midst of some of these incredible challenges that
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.700]   we face.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:39.140]   And I want to take you to Paul, one of the great, great leaders of the church, if not
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:42.900]   the greatest leader you could argue of the church, who struggled deeply with mental health
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   issues.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.260]   I want to show you one of those examples where it becomes too much for him.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.220]   This is 2 Corinthians 12, verse 7.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.140]   Is this helping somebody so far?
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.340]   Somebody feeling ministered to already?
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.260]   Okay, we're about to go into the Word.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.180]   Now it's less me and more Scripture.
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.180]   Amen?
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.180]   All right, good.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.300]   2 Corinthians 12, verse 7.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.500]   To keep me from becoming conceited because of these unsurpassing great revelations, there
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:12.180]   was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.660]   Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away, but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.220]   for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:25.340]   Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ's power
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.420]   may rest also on me.
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.860]   This is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.540]   persecutions, in difficulties.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.260]   For when I am weak, then I am strong.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:43.340]   When my anxiety is upon me, I have been in some of my weakest moments.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:51.180]   But in my weakest moments, I can stand before you today and declare I was my strongest."
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.220]   Paul mentions something here.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.660]   He calls it a thorn in the flesh.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.140]   The word for thorn is the word scallop.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.580]   It sounds like scallops, but it's scallop with an O.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.740]   Scallops means a sharp and pointed thing.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.260]   That's all it means, a sharp and pointed thing.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.700]   And Paul uses this idea in a metaphorical way here.
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:17.020]   And he goes on to say that this sharp and pointed thing was at work in me.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.620]   Now scholars actually don't know what the thorn is.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.340]   Paul never defines the thorn.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.340]   It's one of those annoying things.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.080]   It's like, "Paul, why didn't you just tell us what the thorn was?"
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.380]   And scholars have had fun over centuries trying to decide what the thorn was, right?
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.220]   This is what scholars kind of get up to, right?
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.780]   And they've come up with three ideas.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.180]   One is that maybe it was a physical impairment like his eyesight.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.620]   And later on in his life, he definitely struggled with his eyesight.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.300]   Or maybe it was people or an opposition that was brought against his ministry.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.660]   And he was struggling to fight off this personal opposition by somebody to his ministry.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.780]   Or maybe thirdly, it was emotional baggage that he was carrying around with him from
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.420]   the years that he used to persecute Christians.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.320]   And now he's working and leading a church and in the churches.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   And maybe he's got this emotional baggage that's driving him.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.520]   We don't know what the thorn was, but it doesn't matter.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.820]   The thorn is not the point.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.060]   What's the point is what the thorn did to him.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.120]   And he describes here, "It tormented me."
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.240]   The word for torment there is the Greek word kozosphizo.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.300]   And kozosphizo literally means this.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.500]   It means to be beaten.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   It means to be smashed.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.780]   It means to be physically pummeled and hit and hard.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.980]   This word is only repeated one at a time in the whole of the New Testament.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:40.660]   And it's found right at the moment where Jesus is being beaten up before he goes on the cross.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.820]   And I think Paul chooses this word specifically because he's trying to communicate to his
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:50.740]   church the mental and emotional torment he's going through because of the thorn.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.900]   He's like, "It's like every day I'm getting beaten up.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.260]   It's like every day I feel like I'm being pummeled and smacked and hit.
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.980]   I feel like what Jesus went through before he went to the cross, how he was beaten bloody
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:08.420]   by the people who had imprisoned him, that's only the way I can describe the mental and
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.420]   emotional toil and anguish that I was going through.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.540]   It tormented me in such a way.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.140]   Like me when I got home at night and collapsed in the bed because I was physically exhausted,
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.420]   Paul's saying to his church, "I'm physically exhausted.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.820]   I'm totally tormented.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.620]   Physically and emotionally, this thing is too much for me."
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.840]   And so because of that, he does something.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.700]   He pleads with the Lord three times for it to be taken away.
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.340]   The word "plead" there literally means to beg.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.980]   This is not some sort of, "Jesus, if you'd like to, it'd be awesome if you could take
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.980]   this away."
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.100]   This is like literally he's begging.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.260]   He's on his knees.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.760]   He's crying out because he's tormented by this thing.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.780]   And he's asking God to come and do something that only God can do.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.140]   Three times he goes before God.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.900]   And I want you to know this.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:04.700]   Whatever suffering you ever have in your life, your first response should always to plead
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.700]   to the Lord for him to heal you.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.300]   We believe in healing here at the Vine.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.200]   We believe in the power of Christ to heal people.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.060]   And that healing happens sometimes in an instant.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.580]   I've been in a room in the Philippines where one of our youth prayed for somebody who was
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.660]   blind, and I saw him receive sight immediately.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.660]   It was a New Testament miracle that I cannot explain to you.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.260]   It was unbelievable.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.420]   I've seen God step in and do things that you could never, ever expect.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.580]   I've seen God heal people, redeem people.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.220]   I've seen demons cast out of people.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:41.300]   I've even seen demons cast out of people inside these services on Sundays.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.420]   I've seen some incredible things, but I've also seen my journey.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.340]   And I've seen my journey where just like Paul, I can't tell you the number of times I've
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.380]   prayed to be free of anxiety.
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.500]   The number of times I've asked God, "Would you come?"
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.700]   Begging him, "Come on, God.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.820]   I need to pass through this church well.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.660]   I can't pass through this church well if I'm overwhelmed with anxiety all the time.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:07.460]   If I'm trying to just keep my mind together, how could I even possibly hope to speak of
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.260]   Jesus to the people in a room on a Sunday?
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.620]   Lord, you need to take this from me."
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.180]   And Paul's there going, "I got a church to build.
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:16.340]   I got stuff to do.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.780]   I want to bring salvation to the Gentiles and the whole Greek and Roman Empire.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.460]   God, remove this thing from me."
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.740]   The first thing we do is we ask him and we come to him and we will do that for you.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.180]   If you're struggling with something in your life right now, if there's a suffering going
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.140]   on, if there's something that's overwhelming you, after this service, stay behind.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:39.860]   We will pray for you and we will pray that God heals and delivers you.
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.260]   But for Paul, God didn't.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:52.020]   And I am so grateful that we have this passage in the Bible, because for me, God didn't.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.580]   And maybe for some of you in this room, maybe there's some emotional toil you've been struggling
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.580]   with.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:02.460]   Maybe there's a long-term mental health issue that you're trying to keep under wraps and
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.780]   you're trying to keep control of.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:10.300]   And maybe you prayed many times for it to go and it has not gone.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   And rather than deliver Paul, God does something here that I think has so much to say and so
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.820]   much help to bring any of us that are struggling with some mental health issue.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:30.420]   See, rather than remove the suffering, what God does in this moment is he leads Paul to
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.820]   redefine the suffering.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.900]   I want to show you something here in the verse 7.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.100]   He says, "To keep me from becoming conceited."
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.340]   Paul is so honest with his church.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.060]   Man, this is an open, broken book before his church.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.820]   He's like, "To keep me from becoming conceited."
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.460]   This is a realization Paul had after God told him that he wasn't going to heal him.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:28:00.020]   In fact, I would argue that God's no to him was the catalyst for him to have such a deep
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.980]   revelation of what God needs to do in his life.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:07.140]   That prayer we prayed at the start of this, at the end of worship time, "Lord, have your
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.420]   way in me."
[00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.860]   It's like Paul came to God and said, "Have your way in me."
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.340]   And God said, "I'm doing this because you're conceited."
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.980]   You really want to know how I feel about you, Paul?
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.540]   You got pride in you.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.220]   There's something going on deep inside of you that I need to speak to and deal with
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.220]   in your life.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:32.420]   And to keep you from continuing to operate out of pride, rather than heal you like you
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.780]   would, I'm going to meet you in it.
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.780]   And we're going to journey together.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.420]   And we're going to do some things.
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.620]   And you're going to experience my power in your life like you've never experienced before,
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:48.020]   because my power is made glorious in your weakness.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.540]   Would you bring your weakness to me?"
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.060]   He says to Paul.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.420]   Paul says, "To stop me from becoming conceited."
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.140]   He was conceited before he met Jesus.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.820]   He was conceited because he was a Pharisee above all Pharisees.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.780]   He was a Hebrew of all Hebrews.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.820]   He was somebody who, by his own word, actually was advanced well beyond his years.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.520]   He was an A+ student.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.380]   He was the kind of guy that every parent in Hong Kong wanted to have.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.620]   That was Paul.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.620]   And he got puffed up.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.940]   And he was proud about it.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.580]   And then when he became a Christian, when you think that that would set him free from
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.660]   all that, he says, "I had surpassingly great revelations to deal with.
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.420]   Now not only was I an amazing Pharisee above Pharisees, but I'm also the number one Christian
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.260]   there ever was.
[00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.980]   Now God's given me unsurpassingly great revelations.
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.540]   And in order to keep me grounded, in order to keep me humble, in order to keep me realizing
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:45.260]   that it's only ever the power and the grace and the beauty and the love and the work of
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.980]   God, God kept me in a place where I might have been tormented, but He was there.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.540]   He kept me in a place where although I wanted to be free from it, it was where I needed
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.180]   to be because there was something He was going to show me that I could not experience unless
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.860]   I was in that place."
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:03.860]   God says this.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:12.660]   Jesus says this, verse 9, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:19.620]   Rather than his healing, God wanted Paul to have his power.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.180]   Those two things can sometimes be different.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.600]   Think about that for a minute.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:33.580]   Rather than his healing, rather than relieving him from the torment, God wanted him to experience
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:43.720]   a power that would only be understood if it was encountered in the torment.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.700]   What God's doing here is He's doing something simply profound for Paul.
[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:54.740]   In the area of his mental health struggles, He's leading Paul not to fight it, not to
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:03.640]   flee from it, and not to ignore it, but to face it, to accept it.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.340]   Not accept it like, "Oh, this is fine.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.340]   This is cool.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.340]   Great.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.020]   I'm going to be forever anxious or forever tormented," right?
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.700]   Not accept it like, "Oh, okay, fine.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.700]   It doesn't matter.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.900]   No big deal."
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:19.060]   Accept it in the sense of, "This is part of my journey right now, and it's okay to
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.300]   not be okay.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:27.340]   It's okay to realize that I have something that's happening in my life that is overwhelming,
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.500]   but I am not alone.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.300]   I'm not given up on.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.660]   That God is going to meet me in this moment.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.740]   That God's grace is sufficient."
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:40.860]   Sometimes the most powerful answer God can give you is not healing.
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.460]   Oh, let me preach on this one for a moment.
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.460]   Sometimes the most powerful answer is not your healing.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:54.740]   God's greatest gift to Paul here and God's greatest gift to us is not our healing.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.420]   It is always His grace.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:03.260]   And His grace at times, and it's wonderful, does lead us into moments of incredible healing,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.780]   and we celebrate it, but every single time, what that grace will do is lead you into an
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:13.420]   encounter of Christ's power, even when the healing is absent.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:14.820]   That's His grace.
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.980]   His grace is the most important gift He will ever give you.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:24.540]   And sometimes God doesn't give healing because He wants to give something more.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:30.820]   He wants you to know His grace, and that His grace is sufficient for you.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.420]   And maybe He'll heal you, and maybe He won't, but He will be there for you, and He'll lead
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.180]   you into a place where you can accept the reality that sometimes things are out of your
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.740]   control.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:51.540]   And when things are out of your control, those are the moments when God can be most powerful.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.460]   What God's doing here for Paul is He's helping him to understand, and I think it's something
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.060]   important for us.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.340]   He's helping all of us to understand a journey that's important to go on, and that is to
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.780]   accept the reality that sometimes things are out of our control, and sometimes that's our
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.980]   thinking and our feeling.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.700]   So often when we encounter mental health issues, when I first encountered my anxiety, my reaction
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:19.620]   was I need to control this thing, and I need to stop feeling this way.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:23.660]   And over many years of therapy, God led me to a place where actually I was able to accept
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.160]   the reality of my anxiety.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.180]   Not accept it from like, "I'm just going to give up."
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:34.660]   I continue today to stand with it, to fight with it, to pray to God about it, but I continue
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.500]   to understand that it is not the sum total of who I am.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.940]   I continue to understand that it might be a co-passenger on my bus, but it will not
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.940]   drive my bus.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.060]   That the only person who ever drives my bus is Christ, and His grace is sufficient.
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:59.100]   Even if anxiety is on my bus for the rest of my life, His grace is sufficient for me.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.500]   What Paul was able to do here…
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.860]   Can I go another five, ten minutes?
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   Is that all right?
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.740]   Is this okay for everybody, leaning into this?
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:13.420]   What Paul does here is rather than fight his torment, rather than flee from it, he actually
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:19.300]   finds himself in a place where he can accept it so that it creates space in him to actually
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.060]   take a different perspective to the torment itself.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.940]   Where before he was trying to fight that torment, when before his attitude was, "I need to
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.820]   get rid of this thing," he then comes to a position where he can change his relationship
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:41.860]   to his suffering, and go from an attack and a kind of "get it out of me" to a trust
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:48.460]   in God's grace and a distance from it that will eventually enable it to be released.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.420]   This is a beautiful thing.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.980]   God's like, "This journey that I want to lead you on, it's the journey that will truly
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.980]   set you free.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.260]   Sure, I could heal you in an instant, and I could take the pain away immediately, but
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.300]   the next time the anxiety comes, you're going to be in the same place of torment.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.020]   But if I can lead you to a place where you'll understand that my grace is sufficient for
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.620]   you, if I can lead you in a place where you can open your heart and say, 'You know what?
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.780]   Sometimes this is just a part of who I am.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.780]   I don't understand it.
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:19.340]   I don't always like it, but it is who I am in some times of my life, and yet here now
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.820]   is an opportunity to lean in again to the grace of God, lean in again to the power of
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:32.220]   Christ, and God will never let me down, never let me down here, even if I still continue
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.220]   to feel anxious."
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.580]   There's another person in Scripture that felt this way, and I want to take you here as we
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.580]   close.
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.340]   This is from Matthew chapter 26.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.740]   This person has the name Jesus.
[00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.300]   Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.980]   here while I go over there and pray."
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.740]   He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him and began to be sorrowful and
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.740]   troubled.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.740]   I want you to see this.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.700]   Jesus also struggled with mental and emotional anguish.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:06.500]   Verse 38, "And then he said to them, 'My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   death.'"
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.260]   This is how hard this is for Jesus.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.740]   He literally wants to die.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.700]   He's so overwhelmed and tormented that he wants to die.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.200]   He says, "Stay here.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   Keep watch with me."
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.540]   "Going a little farther, he fell face to the ground and prayed, 'My Father, if it's possible
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:28.180]   for me, may this cup be taken from me, yet not as I will, but as you will.'
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.860]   Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping."
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.660]   Oh my goodness.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.220]   This is like sometimes when I look up from preaching and I find you sleeping.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.060]   It's not good.
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:42.340]   It's not good, people.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.380]   I'm much nicer to you than Jesus is to the disciples.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.380]   Look what he says here.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.360]   He says, "Could you men not keep watch with me?"
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.360]   For what?
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   Can you not stay awake for 25 minutes?
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   Okay, it's 40 minutes, but whatever.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360]   All right.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.520]   He asked Peter, "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation, for the Spirit
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.360]   is willing and the body is weak."
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.800]   He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.240]   to be taken away, unless I drink it, then your will be done."
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.000]   When he came back, he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.920]   So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.040]   Three times God goes before God, like Paul, and says, "Would you remove this from me?
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.440]   If there's any other way, if it's not the cross, I'd be super happy.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.960]   If you can lead me in any other direction, God, and I can do this salvation thing any
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.520]   other way, that's what I want, but not my will.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.520]   Your will be done."
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.200]   In other words, may it be to me whatever it is that you want to be to me, but this is
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.320]   hurting, this is anguish, this is difficult.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.240]   But three times God doesn't give them any other way.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.360]   So at the end of the third time, he submits himself to the will of God.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.720]   He's arrested, he's beaten, "kososfixo," smashed up.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:58.520]   And then, notice this, the greatest pain and humiliation then came.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.560]   His accusers put a crown of thorns on his head.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.320]   Ooh, thorns.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.800]   So I wonder when Paul later on talked about thorns, I wonder whether he was trying to
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.680]   get the church to think about this moment.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.560]   The thorns were placed on Jesus, and the thorns cut his head.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.200]   And if you've ever had a head wound, you'll know that head wounds bleed a lot.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.080]   So here's the crazy thing.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:31.080]   The crown of thorns that Jesus' accusers put on his head to hurt and humiliate him became
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:39.560]   the very thing that caused the blood to flow on the cross that would bring him glory.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.440]   Come on church, that's deep, I know, but take that in.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:49.800]   The very thing that the enemy had designed, the thorn, to create the pain, actually was
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.520]   the very thing that shed the blood that would be the very thing that would bring glory.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.280]   You see, the thorn brought the blood that would bring the glory.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.280]   And it will be the same in your life as well.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:07.360]   The thorns in our flesh that God gives us grace to walk in will be the very things that
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:15.040]   will pour the blood of Jesus upon us and show us his glory like never before.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:25.320]   It's the thorns that bring the blood that even when we're weak, he is strong.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   Can I pray for you?
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:35.680]   I wonder if you'd stand with me and I want to pray for you.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.080]   I wonder whether you'd just open your hands with me.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:44.760]   Father, just so grateful.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:51.040]   Just let a moment, I sense the Lord wants to do some deep ministry for some of you here
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.600]   now.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:40:01.560]   Some of you have been carrying something for so long and the Holy Spirit is here now.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:09.760]   Some of you have been fighting something for so long.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:15.120]   Some of you have been ignoring something for so long.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:21.200]   Some of you, like me, are afraid to talk to people about it because you think that they
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.400]   will see you weak.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.280]   Some of you have been really frustrated because you've been praying and praying and praying
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:33.480]   and God hasn't taken it away.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:40.520]   Maybe like Paul, God wants to redefine for some of us our relationship to our suffering
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:46.560]   because there is something of his glory that we could never see otherwise.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.040]   Just take a moment now just to allow the Spirit of God to speak to you.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:58.280]   He loves you so much.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:04.720]   Disability is still an issue in my life, but I have come to such deep encounters of the
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:12.040]   grace of God that I never regret getting it.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:21.360]   My prayer is that you would come to know a God whose grace is sufficient in whatever
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:28.440]   suffering he might be inviting you to carry.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.960]   One of my favorite passages from Genesis is when Joseph is standing in front of his brothers
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.160]   who have sold him into slavery.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.440]   I want to read this to you whilst your eyes are closed and your hands are open.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   He says this.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:48.920]   He says, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for his good, to accomplish what
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:54.600]   is now being done, the saving of many lives.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:01.640]   My anxiety intended to harm me, but God has intended it for good, so that I would come
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.480]   to know him in a way I couldn't otherwise."
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:12.640]   Father, we come against the enemy's strategies in this area of the church to stop us from
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:19.160]   talking about it, to make us boil it all down to one simple solution.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:28.560]   Father, we come to you as a people of grace, as a people in need of grace, as a people
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.560]   in need of healing.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.760]   And Lord, I believe that you will heal people in this room, that there'll be some people
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.120]   in this room that will be healed very quickly.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.720]   And that's a wonderful work of your grace.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.040]   And there'll be people in this room that will be called to carry what it is that they're
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.520]   carrying for many years.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.920]   And that also is a wonderful work of your grace.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:56.320]   Lord, I pray that we would find a God whose grace is sufficient.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:03.360]   Take your time just to allow the Spirit to minister to you.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.360]   Come Lord Jesus, come.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.940]   (gentle music)
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.940]   [Music]
