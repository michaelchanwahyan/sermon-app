1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
 We want to warmly welcome each and every one of you here tonight on this Good Friday.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,400
 Tonight we journey together and we reflect on the death of our Savior, Jesus Christ,

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,520
 and we really take this time to contemplate what his sacrifice means to us as believers.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,680
 And as we gather around the cross tonight, we are going to listen to God's Word.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,240
 We are going to listen to Scripture and we will respond in song, respond in liturgical

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,840
 prayer, and we do this together.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,440
 For those who have come with our children, no matter how young or how old, I want to

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,160
 encourage you to enjoy this time as a family, worship together, pray together, take communion

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,000
 together.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,160
 A special part of tonight's service together is we are going to respond to the living God

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,520
 through liturgical prayer.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,480
 And simply put, these are prayers that involve all of us as a community responding reflectively

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,320
 and prayerfully back to God.

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,560
 And so the form of these prayers is a call and response.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,840
 As a service leader, I will pray and I will read out the part under service leader, and

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,400
 you will respond as a congregation, all of us in one voice, and you will pray and read

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,640
 the parts titled congregation.

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,960
 You will understand once we pray and respond in a few lines.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,680
 Regardless of where you are in life, what you're going through, tonight, our living

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,160
 God meets us.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,960
 And just as always, as you come and worship, we want you to just be yourself and respond

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,180
 with a worshipful heart.

23
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,840
 And so let us open our hearts to God and behold and contemplate Him.

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,140
 And as we do, know that God hears us.

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,820
 As we speak, we speak directly to God.

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,080
 And as we gather here, He is with us.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,900
 Psalm 22 says, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,040
 Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,380
 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer.

30
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,620
 By night, I find no rest.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,500
 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One.

32
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,620
 You are the one Israel praises.

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,700
 In you, our ancestors put their trust.

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,320
 They trusted and you delivered them.

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,380
 To you, they cried out and were saved.

36
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,320
 In you, they trusted and were not put to shame.

37
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:41,660
 But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by everyone, despised by the people.

38
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,660
 All who see me mock me.

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,360
 They hurl insults, shaking their heads.

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,440
 He trusts in the Lord, they say.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,560
 Let the Lord rescue him.

42
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,040
 Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,920
 Yet you brought me out of the womb.

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,360
 You made me trust in you, even at my mother's breast.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,440
 From birth, I was cast on you.

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,200
 From my mother's womb, you have been my God.

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,140
 So do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.

48
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,080
 My heart has turned to wax.

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,160
 It has melted within me.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,400
 Things surround me.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,840
 A pack of villains encircles me.

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,480
 They pierce my hands and my feet.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,800
 All my bones are on display.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
 People stare and gloat over me.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
 They divide my clothes amongst them and cast lots from my garment.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,900
 But you, Lord, do not be far from me.

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,240
 You are my strength.

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,760
 Come quickly to help me.

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,760
 Deliver me from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs.

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
 Rescue me from the mouth of the lions.

61
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,120
 Save me from the horns of the wild oxen.

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,960
 We couldn't help but fall asleep.

63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,400
 I mean, we didn't want to.

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,560
 We tried to stay awake, but we were just so tired from all the things that had happened

65
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,280
 in the week that we had arrived in Jerusalem.

66
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,920
 And we had gathered now on the top of Mount Olives, and we were looking out on the beautiful

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,400
 temple, and we were trying our best to stay awake and to pray.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,240
 And just, he stood off in the distance in the dark, praying a line.

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
 It was Peter who fell asleep first, of course.

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,840
 And as soon as he fell asleep, well, I guess we thought it was permission for all of us

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,480
 to fall asleep.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,800
 And then that thing I remember is being shaken awake by Jesus himself.

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,220
 He was angry at us for the weakness that we had to not kind of pray in this hour of need.

74
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,700
 But I remembered he was agitated.

75
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,280
 Not just agitated at us, but agitated because he was carrying something.

76
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,480
 I'd actually never seen this in him before.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,840
 A weight upon him, a precious weight that he was carrying that he didn't know how to

78
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
 shake.

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,920
 And as he walked off again into the darkness to pray, I decided this time I would follow

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
 him.

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,040
 I would come after him, and I would sit behind him and listen to what he was saying.

82
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,560
 And I found this old olive tree, and I sat behind it.

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,960
 In the quietness, I leaned in and listened intently.

84
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,000
 The sound Jesus was making was one I had not heard before.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,440
 It was like this low, guttural kind of sound, like a moaning.

86
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,880
 And I realized that he was sobbing.

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,560
 And as I quieted myself down, I tried to hear what he was saying in his prayer.

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,920
 And I could barely make out the words.

89
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:44,480
 He was saying, "Father, take this cup from me, but not my will, your will be done."

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,640
 And then the words were coming out like a raspy breath, like he was spitting the sound

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
 out.

92
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,160
 And he was praying it over and over again.

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,640
 And each time it seemed more urgent for him, as if God was not answering him.

94
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,760
 Take this cup, take this cup, take this cup.

95
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,320
 And so I ran back to the others, and I got them ready.

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,600
 And I said, "We need to pray fervently."

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,880
 And so we started to pray the prayer that he had taught us to pray.

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,600
 "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be your name.

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,920
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

100
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,480
 Your will be done."

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,520
 Not our will, your will.

102
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,560
 I didn't anticipate that that prayer would be answered so quickly.

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,680
 It was actually James who heard him first, although we eventually all heard it.

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,320
 Judas had a way of walking that was distinct, large and heavy footsteps on the ground.

105
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:52,160
 The kind of sound of someone who was so arrogant to think that his presence needed to be announced.

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,880
 And as he was walking, we could also hear other footsteps, a large crowd gathering around

107
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
 him.

108
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,800
 And as I looked out in the moonlight, I could see the dust of the olive groves lifting up.

109
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,220
 And I knew a large crowd was coming, and I could tell that they were angry.

110
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:17,280
 And at that moment, I knew, I knew Jesus was about to be betrayed by Judas.

111
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
 He did it with a kiss.

112
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,920
 Can you imagine it?

113
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,160
 Judas appears before Jesus with a big smile on his face, and he walks straight up to him

114
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,680
 as if he hadn't seen him for years.

115
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,280
 And he says, "Rabbi," and he gives him a kiss on his cheeks.

116
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,600
 The intimacy of a greeting, betraying the faithfulness of a friendship.

117
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,760
 What happened next is hard to describe to you.

118
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,520
 For me now, still, it seems such a blur.

119
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,020
 But as Judas kisses Jesus, suddenly there's this sound.

120
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,720
 These two soldiers emerge from the crowd with swords, and they arrest Jesus.

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,640
 They take him by the arms.

122
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,460
 Peter suddenly jumps up and makes a shouting sound.

123
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,920
 And somehow there's a sword in his hand, and he's waving the sword around like a madman.

124
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,520
 And he cuts off the ear of one of the soldiers.

125
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,040
 Blood starts gushing out of his head.

126
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,480
 And through that, the other soldiers in the crowd raise up their swords.

127
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,840
 They start to charge forward.

128
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,440
 And I realize that this is the moment of our death.

129
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,080
 And right when things are the noisiest, a loud, commanding voice comes, and everything

130
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,720
 else silences around it.

131
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,860
 Jesus says this.

132
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,480
 He says, "What, you think I'm leading a rebellion, that you would come against me with swords

133
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,440
 and sticks to arrest me?

134
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,640
 Don't you realize I've been with you in the temple courts day in and day out, teaching

135
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,640
 your people?

136
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,160
 You never arrested me then.

137
00:08:49,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 So come and do what you have come to do, because the Scriptures must be fulfilled."

138
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
 It was painful to see what happened next.

139
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,400
 But at the same time, one of the most majestic things I'd ever seen.

140
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,920
 Jesus goes down to the ground and picks up the ear.

141
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,040
 And he walks over to the man whose head was bleeding.

142
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,640
 And with the most tender words I think I've ever heard Jesus say, he places his hand on

143
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,280
 his head and he prays.

144
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,480
 The man's head is restored, his ear is remade, and he can hear again.

145
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,800
 And the pain is gone.

146
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,080
 I mean, I've seen many miracles that Jesus has done in our time.

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,560
 But this one, years later, I came to understand as one of his greatest.

148
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,120
 I came to understand it because of the moment that it happened in.

149
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,100
 I mean, could you imagine it?

150
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,000
 This is his worst hour.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,260
 He's just been praying to his God to take the power of the cross from him.

152
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,440
 He's just been betrayed by one of his best friends.

153
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,840
 He's just been arrested by people who have a sword.

154
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,280
 And in the midst of all of that, Jesus does something that I think none of us would have

155
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
 done.

156
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,520
 Certainly, that I would not have done in that moment.

157
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,960
 In his worst hour, Jesus loved.

158
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,120
 He loved.

159
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,320
 Jesus responds to betrayal with the gift of love.

160
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:36,520
 And I would come to understand that this gift of love would shape all the events that were

161
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:47,320
 to happen next.

162
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,120
 In your hours of struggle and suffering in the garden, Jesus, you are truly here with

163
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,920
 us in flesh and blood, in heart and spirit.

164
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:08,120
 You who endured the agony in the garden, you offer up prayers to him who is able to save

165
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,920
 you from death, learning obedience from the things that you suffer.

166
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,840
 Oh, Jesus, in your readiness to suffer, that was tried and proven in the garden.

167
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
 Have mercy on us.

168
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,000
 Jesus, who was abandoned by the sleeping apostles.

169
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,480
 Have mercy on us.

170
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,800
 Jesus, in your love for us, that was not overcome in the garden.

171
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,160
 Have mercy on us.

172
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,120
 Jesus, in your goodness that was not embittered even in the garden.

173
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,520
 Have mercy on us.

174
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,080
 Jesus, in your courage that remained steadfast even in the garden.

175
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,880
 Have mercy on us.

176
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,160
 Jesus, in your meekness that did not falter even in the garden.

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,760
 Have mercy on us.

178
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,840
 Jesus, in your anguish and sorrow, in your fear and trembling praying in the garden.

179
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,440
 Have mercy on us.

180
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,800
 Jesus, who said, "Not my will, but yours be done."

181
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,560
 Have mercy on us.

182
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,520
 Jesus, who knew the sins of the whole world in the garden.

183
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,880
 Have mercy on us.

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,960
 Jesus, who knew our sins and was willing to take all of this upon yourself in the garden.

185
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,000
 Have mercy on us.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,440
 Jesus, who was the most abandoned of all the abandons, who loved every one of us sinners.

187
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,880
 Have mercy on us.

188
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,440
 Oh, Jesus, in the garden of olives.

189
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
 Have mercy on us.

190
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,520
 Spare us.

191
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,920
 Deliver us from the evil.

192
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,040
 From the sins that you wept for in this garden.

193
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,520
 From ingratitude for your love.

194
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,240
 From indifference in your suffering.

195
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,160
 From resistance to your grace towards us.

196
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,280
 From bitterness over our own bitter agony and suffering.

197
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,840
 From doubt about God's love in our darkest hours.

198
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,680
 From despair in our moments of abandonment.

199
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
 Deliver us, oh Jesus.

200
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,840
 We ask this, we give this, in your mercy.

201
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,360
 Give us grace.

202
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,720
 Lamb of God, grant us, grant that we may gratefully return the love which prompted you to endure

203
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,240
 your most holy sufferings in this garden of olives for us sinners.

204
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
 Amen.

205
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,640
 Isaiah 53.

206
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,600
 Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?

207
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,720
 He grew up before him like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground.

208
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,040
 He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him.

209
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,600
 Nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.

210
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,920
 He was despised and rejected by mankind.

211
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,520
 A man of suffering and familiar with pain.

212
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,680
 Like one from whom people hide their faces.

213
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:33,120
 He was despised as we held him in low esteem.

214
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,200
 Of the hundreds of men that I have sentenced to death over my career, I actually do remember

215
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,960
 this Jesus that you speak of.

216
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,240
 Not because of him though, of course.

217
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,640
 No, he was inconsequential.

218
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,960
 I remember it because it was a day that Herod and I became best friends.

219
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,560
 I'd always thought Herod was a ghastly figure.

220
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,720
 So masculine but lacking the nuance of intelligence that you need for leadership.

221
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,960
 I would avoid him in social gatherings all the time because, you know, I wouldn't want

222
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,520
 to be associated with him.

223
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,320
 But on this particular day, I actually needed an ally.

224
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,360
 And to my surprise, Herod became one.

225
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,200
 And in that, he proved to me that I was right.

226
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,720
 They brought this Jesus before me, these chief priests and scribes of the law.

227
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,380
 And they accused him of all of these crimes, saying that he had done heresies and subversions.

228
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,000
 They told me that he was teaching people that they no longer had to give taxes to Caesar.

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,080
 A reasonable crime, I admit.

230
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,880
 But the one that actually intrigued me the most was when they told me that he was holding

231
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040
 on to the claim that he was the king of the Jews.

232
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,840
 Now, let's put aside one moment the fact that that is actually my title as governor over

233
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
 Judea.

234
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,760
 And let's just focus on the fact that these scribes and chief priests wanted to kill him

235
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,480
 because of this claim.

236
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,560
 Now, I'm not Jewish, as you can probably tell by looking at me.

237
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:05,120
 But I, as governor of Judea, have made it my place to learn about these Jewish customs

238
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,800
 and the quaint religious traditions they have.

239
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,760
 I've actually read their scriptures and think that I know it better than some of them.

240
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,600
 I knew they were looking for a messiah.

241
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,440
 I knew they were excited for a king to come and rule them again, so that they could get

242
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,720
 rid of those nasty little Gentiles, to overcome the Roman Empire, and to establish a Jewish

243
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,040
 state forever.

244
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,560
 But here is the irony for me.

245
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:38,040
 One had finally come who was saying that he was the fulfillment of the prophecy, and they

246
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,360
 wanted not to enthrone him, but kill him.

247
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,840
 Sometimes the things that you long for when they arrive become the things that you want

248
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,640
 the least.

249
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,580
 Well, this Jesus was in my court, so I had to do something.

250
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,040
 So I took my most commanding voice and I said this.

251
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,880
 I said, "Are you the king of the Jews?"

252
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,440
 It's quite effective, isn't it?

253
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:15,000
 His reply was this, "Yes, it is as you say."

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And that was it.

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,800
 That was the extent of our conversation.

256
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,760
 And I looked upon this man with pity.

257
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,160
 He was no threat to the Roman Empire.

258
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,600
 This man was not dangerous.

259
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,120
 Certainly he wasn't a warring king that they wanted.

260
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,600
 And so I said to them, I said, "I see nothing wrong with this man.

261
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,840
 He's not done anything.

262
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
 He's not dangerous.

263
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,080
 I see no crime in him."

264
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,940
 You should have heard their response.

265
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,360
 They started shouting.

266
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,740
 They started uproaring all over the place.

267
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,360
 One of their law teachers came up to me personally, and he said, "Don't you understand that this

268
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:56,320
 man has come from Galilee all the way down to Jerusalem teaching heresy as he's come?"

269
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,920
 And now this was their mistake.

270
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,960
 They told me he had come from Galilee and I am not the protector of Galilee.

271
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,200
 I'm the protector of Judea.

272
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,260
 Herod is the protector of the people from Galilee.

273
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,400
 And so if they want to charge this man, it's not my responsibility, it's Herod's.

274
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,000
 I told them to send him off to Herod and let's see what Herod would make of him, whether

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,680
 Herod would agree with me or not.

276
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,520
 We sent Jesus off and to be honest with you, I thought that was the end of it.

277
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,660
 I was wrong, which doesn't happen very often, but did on this occasion.

278
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,680
 For at the end of the day, there was Jesus once again standing in my court.

279
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,000
 This time though, he was wearing a red robe.

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,040
 Herod had put a robe that mocked him as a king.

281
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,160
 And it was a message to me, because what Herod was saying was, "I agree with you, Pilate.

282
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,800
 I agree that this man is innocent.

283
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,360
 I agree with you that he's not who he claims to be.

284
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,200
 I agree with you that he's not the king that the Jewish people are hoping for.

285
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
 There's no crime here," Herod was saying to me.

286
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,120
 "Let him go."

287
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,960
 And off the back of Herod's thought and mine, I stood before the same crowd that I had stood

288
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,320
 before hours earlier, and I said, "There's no crime here.

289
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 He's not a danger.

290
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,000
 I will punish him and let him go."

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,200
 At that moment, I have what I can only describe to you as a riot in my court.

292
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,280
 It was so embarrassing.

293
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,040
 Everybody started shouting, "Crucify him!

294
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,280
 Crucify him!

295
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
 Crucify him!"

296
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,400
 And I kept on saying, "He's innocent.

297
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
 I see nothing wrong with him.

298
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 Crucify him!

299
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
 Crucify him!"

300
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,320
 And the noise was so loud that I got to the point where I just wanted these Jews to shut

301
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,560
 up.

302
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,240
 I realized that I had sent far more innocent people to their death than this Jesus.

303
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,580
 And so I responded, and I said, "All right, if you want him dead, it's no consequence

304
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
 to me.

305
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,680
 He can be dead.

306
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,680
 We can crucify him."

307
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,640
 And I told them, "I am a man of peace."

308
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:22,560
 And I realized that sometimes, you know, peace comes through the doorway of death.

309
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:33,480
 Oh Christ, grant us understanding of your courage, strength, and patience in the face

310
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
 of death.

311
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,720
 Be with us in our own trials, and in our death, and in our life.

312
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,760
 Jesus, you are the light that shines on in darkness.

313
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,240
 The darkness has never mastered it.

314
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,800
 Jesus, you are the King of glory.

315
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,960
 Your glory is not to be served, but to serve.

316
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,400
 Jesus, you are the King of love.

317
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
 Your love is to give yourself a ransom for many.

318
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,800
 Jesus, you suffer what looks like defeat, but emerge victorious.

319
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,320
 Jesus, your power comes to its full strength in weakness.

320
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:28,160
 We pray for those tasks to make.

321
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,560
 We call upon you and your mercy to mediate and lead them.

322
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,200
 Help our brothers and sisters to be true to what they themselves believe, yet to be ready

323
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,400
 to be led deeper into revelations about themselves, and to change their views and convictions

324
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:51,240
 by what you show them.

325
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,280
 We pray for the victims of accident, malice, and violence.

326
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,880
 Those who stand falsely accused.

327
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,560
 Those bearing the burden of painful illness, whether physical or mental.

328
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,060
 Those caught in intolerable webs of fear and perplexity.

329
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,840
 Those feeling abandoned and forgotten in the dark.

330
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,120
 Those enduring the agony of bereavement, and of physical suffering, and of anxiety for

331
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:31,880
 the safety of their dear loved ones.

332
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,280
 May Jesus, who passed this way himself, be known to all those suffering as the Savior

333
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,840
 who will bring healing and liberation.

334
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,440
 And on this Friday evening, may you reveal to us the truth of who you truly are.

335
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:56,360
 Amen.

336
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,440
 He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth.

337
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:10,280
 He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,

338
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,840
 so he did not open his mouth.

339
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,640
 By oppression and judgment, he was taken away.

340
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,560
 Yet, who of his generation protested?

341
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,680
 For he was cut off from the land of the living.

342
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:35,740
 For the transgression of my people, he was punished.

343
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,240
 I was once given the title, "The King of Death."

344
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,840
 Sounds rather nasty, doesn't it?

345
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,040
 I thought it was quite fitting at the time, to be honest with you.

346
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,840
 I was a centurion that was overlooking most of the executions that were happening in the

347
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,920
 Greek Roman Empire at the time, particularly those by the procouncil of Judea.

348
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,200
 I was actually very good at my job.

349
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,480
 We killed mostly criminals and political prisoners of the Roman Empire.

350
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,140
 Now, here's how I did it.

351
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,920
 I was actually so skilled that from nailing somebody on the cross to their death, it would

352
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,760
 only take about three hours.

353
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,520
 I would use three nails in order to accomplish it, and in order for things to be efficient,

354
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,600
 we would often crucify three people at a time.

355
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,320
 I want you to think of this, three hours to death, three nails, crucifying three people

356
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 at a time.

357
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,960
 It would actually be years later that I would come to understand the true significance of

358
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,920
 the number three in the death and resurrection of Jesus.

359
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,560
 Jesus.

360
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,640
 I didn't know him personally at the time, of course, but I had heard of him.

361
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,200
 He was the only person the soldiers were talking about.

362
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,800
 I remember walking into the praetorium, and there he was standing there wearing this scarlet

363
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,440
 robe.

364
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,500
 We had been told that his crime that we were about to kill him for was because he was claiming

365
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,040
 to be a king, the king of the Jews.

366
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:10,160
 We looked at him there, looking pathetic in his robe, the scorniness of him.

367
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,760
 So we mocked him.

368
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,960
 We spat at him.

369
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,260
 I actually told my crew of men that they could do whatever they wanted with him.

370
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,440
 Some of them gathered and formed a crown of thorns.

371
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,320
 They came and they placed a crown of thorns on his head, and they pushed it down so hard

372
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:34,880
 that the thorns cut him, and the blood that poured down out of the marks went through

373
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,200
 his face, making little tracks of blood on his cheeks like evil tears.

374
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,560
 We put a staff in his hand, and I instructed all of those who were in my company to bow

375
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:56,520
 down before him in mock worship and then stand up and hit him as hard as they could.

376
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,200
 After about 70 of them had done this, I judged that if it continued, he would maybe die in

377
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,920
 private rather than the shame of a public death that he had been ordered, and I told

378
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,460
 my men to back off.

379
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,700
 We stripped him of that robe.

380
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:20,760
 We put his own clothes back on him, and then we led him out to be crucified.

381
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,240
 I'm taking it in this room that none of you have ever nailed somebody to the cross.

382
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,240
 It's quite a skill, actually.

383
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,080
 The reason why we beat up our prisoners is because we want them exhausted so that they

384
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,800
 do not fight what happens next.

385
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,520
 We lie them down on the cross, and as they're held there by the soldiers, I take a heavy

386
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,720
 hammer and some big nails.

387
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,480
 I drive the first one through one wrist, the second one through the other wrist, and then

388
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,040
 we have fashioned a special nail for the bottom part.

389
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,640
 To get through both the bones of the ankles, we have to drive it in as hard as possible.

390
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,040
 It is excruciatingly painful, and that, my friends, is the point.

391
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,880
 I remember this Jesus, and I remember taking the nail and as I was banging it into him

392
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,400
 as hard as I could, I remember thinking, "Here's one who claims to be the Son of God.

393
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,920
 I mean, would the Son of God put him through this?"

394
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,600
 I mean, if this person really was the Son of God, how did he end up in this situation

395
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 in the first place?

396
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:34,520
 And I have to tell you, I enjoyed driving those nails into him.

397
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,160
 Jesus did not die within three hours.

398
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,840
 I have to say I admire his fight for life, but I'd seen this before and I knew death

399
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,880
 would finally come.

400
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,960
 And at the ninth hour, I watch as Jesus shakes violently.

401
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,920
 He then says something in a tongue that I do not understand, and then he breathes out

402
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,720
 his last and he dies.

403
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,780
 He's dead.

404
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:07,440
 And his death singles the end to my day.

405
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:15,840
 And as I'm beginning to walk back to the praetorium, something happened that's hard to describe.

406
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,800
 There was this shaking that happens around my feet.

407
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,000
 When it first took place, I thought that maybe I was just dizzy.

408
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
 I mean, I was famished.

409
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
 I hadn't eaten for hours.

410
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,320
 But as I looked down there and thought maybe I should sit down for a moment, all the ground

411
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,440
 around me began to shake.

412
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,800
 And it began to shake so hard and I found myself falling down onto the ground and lying

413
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,680
 down and covering my eyes.

414
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,940
 And as I peered out from my hands on the ground, I could see the rocks around me splitting

415
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,280
 and shaking.

416
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:53,520
 And then I gazed over to the tombs of Golgotha, tombs where I had laid men many times before.

417
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,120
 And you will think I'm lying, but I actually saw dead men come out of those tombs, still

418
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,000
 wearing their grave clothes.

419
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,120
 One walked straight past me where I was lying.

420
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,120
 And in the midst of all of this, a darkness comes, a darkness that I cannot explain to

421
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
 you.

422
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,320
 I've never experienced such darkness in the world before.

423
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,280
 And I am absolutely terrified.

424
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:28,020
 And then suddenly, almost as quickly as it had began, suddenly it stopped.

425
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,860
 And silence descended again.

426
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,260
 And brightness came back to the world.

427
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:40,340
 And from lying where I was, I looked back up at the cross and Jesus was still hanging

428
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,260
 there and he was still dead.

429
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,780
 But as I looked at him, I saw him differently.

430
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,380
 He himself was not different.

431
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,920
 I saw him differently.

432
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,860
 I realized that he was not a liar.

433
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,740
 I can't tell you how I understood it.

434
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,620
 But what I had just experienced and what I had just seen, there was no other explanation

435
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,460
 for it.

436
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:20,420
 And as I looked up at him, I realized that I had just killed someone who actually was

437
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,860
 the person he claimed to be.

438
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:29,400
 And in that realization, I realized that I was the one responsible for setting my men

439
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,940
 on him and beating him up, for mocking him for the king that he actually was.

440
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,220
 I was the one responsible for banging in the nails that brought him excruciating pain.

441
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:45,620
 I had been the one that had stood there for hours on hours hoping for his death.

442
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:58,500
 And as I looked at him, what I saw was not his face, but mine.

443
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,460
 I saw myself on that cross.

444
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,820
 I saw myself hanging there.

445
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:10,820
 I saw all of the things that I had done for years and years, the things that I had covered

446
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:20,400
 up in false pretenses of power, the things that I had done to people that were not right.

447
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,300
 And as I looked at him, I saw myself and I realized it was me who should have been there,

448
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,620
 but this one had taken the place where I should have been.

449
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,260
 And in realizing that, guilt came over me like a wave.

450
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:46,620
 And I felt so cut up inside that I had been the one responsible for killing him.

451
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,140
 I remember turning to the soldier who was lying next to me.

452
00:31:52,140 --> 00:32:02,940
 And as our eyes met, I said these words, I said, "Surely this one actually was the Son

453
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:14,820
 of God."

454
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:21,860
 Our Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior and Redeemer, we kneel before your blessed cross.

455
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,400
 We open our hearts to contemplate your holy sufferings.

456
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,620
 We pray we might receive more deeply in our hearts all you did and suffered, and that

457
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,100
 we might realize whom it was you suffered for.

458
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,700
 May your grace be with us, the grace that shakes off the coldness and indifference in

459
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,700
 our hearts, so that we may dwell with you in love, sorrow, and gratitude.

460
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:53,620
 In the Lord's hearts, may your crystallized love embrace our poor, weak, and weary hearts.

461
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,500
 Fill us now with an awareness of you.

462
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,940
 Stir up within us what we need so badly, compassion for you, love for you, honesty

463
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,820
 and faithfulness, and perseverance to contemplate your holy death on the cross.

464
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,620
 Let your death on the cross, the greatest act of loving kindness, penetrate our hearts.

465
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:39,420
 Right to its very core, right to its very center, that we might truly understand.

466
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:48,460
 Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken

467
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,460
 by him and afflicted.

468
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,020
 But he was pierced for our transgressions.

469
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,900
 He was crushed for our iniquities.

470
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:07,100
 The punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.

471
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,260
 We all, like sheep, have gone astray.

472
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,940
 Each of us has turned to our own way.

473
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:23,420
 And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

474
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:30,180
 Joseph had invited me to help him take Jesus' body down from the cross.

475
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,020
 Seemed like a fantasy to me that he was dead.

476
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,460
 I mean, just days before I had met him in the night in secret.

477
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,740
 As a Pharisee myself, I was keen to understand his understanding of the Torah.

478
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,180
 And I asked him, "Can you explain the law to me?

479
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,060
 How do you teach it?"

480
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,020
 And over hours, Jesus said the most beautiful things.

481
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:58,460
 I mean, he opened up the scriptures to me in ways that I had never encountered before.

482
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,060
 It was almost as if he wasn't interpreting the law.

483
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,460
 It was like he was embodying it.

484
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,300
 It was like he was almost fulfilling it in the way that he spoke.

485
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:14,860
 I mean, the hours just passed away, and eventually the sun was beginning to come up, and a new

486
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
 day was breaking.

487
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,180
 And I said to Jesus, "I want to learn more.

488
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,060
 I want to sit under your teaching more."

489
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,500
 And we had to arrange a time for me to go back and visit him.

490
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:34,100
 Now here he was, dead on a cross, his body filled with blood.

491
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,340
 Joseph had been given permission to remove his body, and he'd invited me to come because

492
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,780
 we thought the authorities might change their minds.

493
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,820
 And so we took Jesus' body as quickly as we could, and we laid him down in a chamber that

494
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
 was nearby.

495
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:53,320
 And as we placed him down, we enacted a traditional Jewish burial.

496
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,980
 We got some warm water, and we began to wipe off the blood from him as much as we could.

497
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:04,220
 Very gently, I removed the crown of thorns that had been placed on his head, not wanting

498
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,720
 to scratch or cut him anymore, even though he was dead.

499
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,580
 I had prepared spices, as is our tradition in a burial moment.

500
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:20,540
 I actually had prepared 75 pounds of myrrh and aloes.

501
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,180
 Months later, I would reflect about the irony of that moment.

502
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:31,260
 The myrrh that I had gathered to anoint him in his death was the same spice that the magi

503
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,900
 had brought him at his birth.

504
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:41,140
 The scent that had welcomed him into our world would now be the scent that would carry him

505
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,820
 to the next.

506
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:52,100
 The way that we do it in our tradition is we take little strips of linen cloth.

507
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:58,980
 And these strips of linen cloth we bring to the spices, and we mix it in and build it

508
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,580
 into the spices just like this.

509
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:07,720
 And the spices give off a fragrance that represents what is happening in this moment.

510
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:14,660
 We take the fragrant linen strips, and we place them carefully, wrapping them around

511
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,700
 the body itself.

512
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,580
 And we wrap it around all of the body, from head to toe, covering it completely.

513
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,380
 And Joseph and I, we did this in reverence and awe.

514
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,500
 We did it in complete silence.

515
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:33,580
 These strips are representative of an honor of a life that is lived.

516
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:39,660
 And what we were doing is providing some grave clothes, grave clothes that we believe Jesus

517
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,860
 would wear for all eternity.

518
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:51,740
 Just a few weeks later, Joseph and I would be sitting with the disciples, having a conversation

519
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,020
 with the risen Christ.

520
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,020
 I remember after that, Joseph and I sitting together, and we looked back on the moment

521
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,300
 where we wrapped him in the linen strips.

522
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,400
 And we talked to ourselves, and we realized that what we were doing took on a profound

523
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,980
 meaning that at the moment we didn't understand.

524
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,340
 But we weren't just in that moment taking linen cloths in a Jewish burial rite and wrapping

525
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,300
 him like we always did.

526
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,300
 Instead, the reality of what was happening dawned on us.

527
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,380
 What we were doing was really taking strips of sin.

528
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,620
 And we were taking strips of sin, and we were wrapping his body with it.

529
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:40,540
 For it had been our sin, my sin, your sin, that had brought him to the place of his death.

530
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,060
 That the strips we were placing around him was like we were covering him in a sin of

531
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,060
 humanity.

532
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,820
 That the wages of sin is death.

533
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,100
 And those strips represented far more.

534
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,300
 They represented the grip of death that had now taken him to his grave.

535
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,220
 And as we wrapped it around him, we thought that that was it.

536
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,260
 Death clothes forever.

537
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,820
 And I was so glad that we were wrong.

538
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,860
 I would often gather with Peter for months, and I would ask him to tell me the story of

539
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,540
 the time when he and the women ran to the tomb.

540
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,780
 And Peter will get this big face of excitement.

541
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,620
 And he'll say, "We ran into the tomb with the women, and we didn't see Jesus' body.

542
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,700
 His body was not there.

543
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:40,100
 What they saw was Joseph and my linen strips folded neatly in the center of the tomb."

544
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:47,260
 It was as if Jesus was saying that grave clothes are only worn by the dead.

545
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,100
 It was like he was saying that these strips of sin are now discarded, set aside, dealt

546
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
 with.

547
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:59,620
 He was saying, "I no longer need to wear humanity's sin anymore, for sin has been overcome.

548
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,580
 Death has been killed."

549
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:11,020
 And I remember seeing him on the day when he ascended to be with his father.

550
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:17,880
 Joseph and I were standing together, and Jesus said these last words to us.

551
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,940
 And then he starts to ascend, and it's hard to describe to you what it was like.

552
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,780
 But as he ascends up into heaven, suddenly we can see that he's not wrapped in anything

553
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,780
 of linen at all.

554
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,340
 And I remember Joseph turning to me in that moment, and he says, "Do you see what he's

555
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,740
 dressed in?

556
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,780
 He's dressed in righteousness.

557
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:43,140
 He's dressed in robes of righteousness."

558
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,820
 And we come to discuss it amongst ourselves, that we now too, in our relationship with

559
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,560
 the risen Christ, in our relationship with the one that no longer wears the grave clothes

560
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,120
 of death, but who has shed those clothes for us, the one who's no longer on the cross,

561
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:06,980
 but is alive with us, he now puts new garments on us, that you now are not wearing death

562
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,660
 anymore, that death no longer has the final say in your life, that the clothes that he

563
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,100
 now wraps you in are also robes of righteousness.

564
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,540
 Not your righteousness, but his.

565
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,900
 His given to you because of what he did on the cross.

566
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,900
 His given to you because he is raised from the dead, so that we would know that we also

567
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,940
 rise.

568
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,820
 And we don't just rise at the end of all things when he returns, but we rise now, dressed

569
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,380
 in clothes of righteousness, to be his hands and feet, to a broken world.

570
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,180
 We saw in that moment, as he ascended to heaven, what would happen for the church as it would

571
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:53,300
 ascend in its glory, to serve those who were broken and lost and hurting around them.

572
00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:00,580
 So on this Good Friday, as like Joseph and I, you come to consider what it is to wrap

573
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,700
 Jesus in the sins of your linen cloth.

574
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:14,860
 For you know that that brought him to death, so that he could overcome death, so that you

575
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,500
 could be brought into life.

576
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:27,220
 Jesus did this so that you might do this to a broken and hurting world.

577
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:33,540
 Rise up and be the resurrection of Christ for a world that desperately needs it.

578
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,140
 Let me pray for you.

579
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,700
 Let's pray.

580
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:45,420
 Father, we are so grateful, so grateful for your cross, so grateful that tonight we've

581
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:51,460
 been able to gather around the beauty and the wonder of your resurrection that comes

582
00:42:51,460 --> 00:43:00,940
 after the profundity of you in the garden, you in the trial, you on the cross, and you

583
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,580
 in the tomb.

584
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,020
 And Father, I want to pray that as we've opened up that story in each of its segments for

585
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:13,780
 everybody here tonight, I pray now you would come and meet with them as they take their

586
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,740
 own time now to journey to your cross once more.

587
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:23,660
 Father, we're thankful that our sin has been dealt with.

588
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,760
 We're thankful that we no longer wear grave clothes.

589
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,660
 We're thankful that in your resurrection we have been given new life.

590
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:45,060
 But on this day, on this Good Friday, we soberly come to your cross again, recognizing that

591
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,220
 we still at times try to wrap linen cloth around you again.

592
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:58,520
 And Father, we come to you now, asking you to meet with us in this moment.

593
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:05,680
 Father, for those in this room that are carrying things that they need to give to you tonight,

594
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,600
 I pray you would come by your Spirit now and lead them.

595
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,880
 For those of us aware of our sin, may you recognize that that's the Holy Spirit at work

596
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,320
 in you, welcoming you to a beautiful place of grace.

597
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:34,880
 Father, as we now come to your table, as we celebrate your death and resurrection in communion,

598
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,600
 Father, we ask that you would now come and remain with us, draw us close.

599
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,920
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

600
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,480
 Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

601
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,480
 Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

602
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,920
 Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

603
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,720
 Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

604
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,640
 Father, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

605
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,520
 In these stations, there will be two things that we want to invite you to do.

606
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,960
 The first is there'll be communion available for you.

607
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,880
 I want to invite you in your own way and in your own time to take communion, to take the

608
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,480
 piece of bread and to take the cup.

609
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,240
 And as you pray and consider what it is to come to the cross tonight, you would take

610
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,960
 communion for yourself at the cross.

611
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,080
 The other thing we want to do is encourage you to symbolize what we've been talking about

612
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,800
 tonight.

613
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,280
 There's a linen cloth, a strip of linen that we've cut for every single person here.

614
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,440
 I want to invite you to do something that will help you over this weekend to continue

615
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,600
 to reflect about what we've been talking about tonight.

616
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,840
 I want to invite you to take a linen cloth and to take one of the bowls of the spices

617
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,360
 and just to put the cloth in the spices like I did earlier.

618
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,600
 The reason why you do that is because we want you to carry around that scent with you over

619
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,000
 the next 48 hours or so.

620
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,960
 And what we're going to invite you to do once you've dipped it in the spices is just to

621
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,880
 twist it up a little bit.

622
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,100
 And if you've come with someone tonight, you can invite them just to help you to tie it

623
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
 around your wrist.

624
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,560
 And as you tie it around your wrist, what you're going to be doing is wearing a bit

625
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,640
 of the grave clothes of Jesus upon you over the next 48 hours or so.

626
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,720
 We want you to wear it because we want you to stay in a place of reflection between Friday,

627
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,280
 Saturday and Sunday.

628
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,320
 The fragrance of the strip will remind you of the fragrancy of what Joseph and Nicodemus

629
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,960
 did for Jesus on that moment.

630
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,640
 Wearing it will remind you of the sin that placed Jesus on the cross and will give you

631
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:57,360
 some time over the next 48 hours to just spend that time with Jesus in reflection on sin.

632
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,520
 And then if you're going to come back here on Sunday, which we highly invite you to do,

633
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,120
 we will take some time on Sunday to cut off the strips that we're wearing as we celebrate

634
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,580
 the risen Jesus together on Sunday morning.

635
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:16,240
 So a place for you to take communion, a place for you to take a linen strip.

636
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,760
 And I want you to do this in a place of prayer and reflection.

637
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,520
 There's no time limit that we have here, but once I sense that we've all partaken in this,

638
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,400
 I'll come back and we will close our service together in a time of prayer.

639
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,480
 But as we move into this moment, let me pray once more.

640
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,480
 Father, I just ask that you would now move powerfully amongst us as we come forward in

641
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:46,600
 our own time, in our own way to take communion and to wear some grave clothes in reflection

642
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
 of you.

643
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,000
 And we pray you would meet us by your spirit.

644
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,020
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

645
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,640
 As you feel led by the spirit, please do come forward.

646
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:07,640
