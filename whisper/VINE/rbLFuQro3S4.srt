1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 Have a seat, have a seat.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,400
 We're really full today,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,360
 so I know there's a bunch of people looking for seats.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,420
 So if you've got a seat next to you,

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,760
 maybe you can just put your hand up in the air

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,080
 and we'll be able to get our host to,

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,320
 there's a seat right here at the front

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,440
 if someone wants to take that.

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,520
 Yes, you.

10
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,480
 I can see it on your face.

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,000
 You're like, "Yes, I want to sit in the front.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,540
 "I'm so excited for Pastor Andrew to spit on me

13
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,340
 "whilst he's speaking.

14
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,580
 "That's so great."

15
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,880
 Just got my splash warning in the front here.

16
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,760
 Hey, we're so glad.

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,200
 If you're joining the Vine for the first time,

18
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,760
 we're so glad that you're here with us.

19
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,440
 My name is Andrew, one of the pastors here,

20
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,820
 and it's such a joy.

21
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,760
 I had the privilege of becoming senior pastor here

22
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,440
 on the 1st of November, 2013.

23
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,160
 And as you can imagine,

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,360
 it was the day of great excitement for me and my family.

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,040
 I'm not sure if it was the day of great excitement

26
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,800
 for anyone else, but it was for me and my family.

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,360
 And I was 38 years old at the time,

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,480
 and you can now find out how old I am,

29
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,580
 but don't do the math.

30
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,280
 But I was 38 years old at the time,

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,200
 and it was a day of joy,

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,520
 but it was a day where I was really unaware,

33
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,000
 and in many ways, maybe not ready within myself

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,560
 for what I was stepping into.

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,520
 I wonder if you've ever had an experience in your life

36
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,520
 where something's opened up for you,

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,500
 you've got an opportunity,

38
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,360
 and you work really hard for that opportunity,

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,320
 and you kind of get into that opportunity,

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,960
 and suddenly things maybe don't turn out quite

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,280
 the way you thought it was gonna turn out.

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,680
 And I remember that I had been so beautifully prepared

43
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,140
 for this leadership role here at the Vine

44
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,140
 by our two founding senior pastors, Tony and John.

45
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,200
 Tony's in this room right now.

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
 He's gonna hate this, but I'm gonna point him out.

47
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
 This is Tony Reed.

48
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,840
 Tony, could you put your hand up in the air

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,880
 so that everybody could honor Tony?

50
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,480
 (congregation applauding)

51
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,840
 And John will be watching online

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,400
 as he does so faithfully every week,

53
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,760
 so John, we honor you too.

54
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,140
 But Tony and John, founding pastors here at the Vine,

55
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,360
 they had prepared me over about a four

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,640
 to five-year process privately,

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,480
 just in terms of us as our leadership,

58
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,600
 but then in terms of publicly,

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,120
 about two years before the church.

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,460
 So there was a real clear process of transition

61
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,640
 from John and Tony to myself as the senior leader here.

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,560
 And so I just honor the fact

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,720
 that they did such a great process.

64
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,400
 But the reality was, I don't know if you've been married here

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,920
 like you might prepare yourself for marriage

66
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,200
 and then you get married and you realize

67
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,960
 that you have no idea what it is to be a husband or a wife.

68
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,800
 I was well-prepared to be senior pastor,

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,820
 but then as soon as I became one,

70
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,280
 I had no idea how to actually do it.

71
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,240
 And in the first couple of months,

72
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,040
 I was overwhelmed by insecurity, by self-doubt,

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,320
 by imposter syndrome.

74
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,000
 Anyone ever had imposter syndrome ever before?

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,120
 Feeling like I was unqualified

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,120
 and in many ways not worthy

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
 of being in the role that I was in.

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
 And what was interesting for me is that this was

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,800
 kind of sort of catalyzed by a couple

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
 of actual physical things that were happening in our church

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,260
 in those first couple of months.

82
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,040
 The first was that as I came in to be a senior pastor here,

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
 the church had gone through a renovation project

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,520
 of this building a couple of years before then.

85
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,360
 And we had obviously raised a lot of money

86
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,200
 to be able to do that.

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
 But the reality was, as I stepped in to be the lead pastor,

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,040
 we were $25 million Hong Kong in debt.

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,160
 And I knew on a kind of general level

90
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,680
 that that wasn't my personal debt.

91
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
 I knew that that was just the reality of it.

92
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,360
 And it was something that I had been a part of

93
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,420
 in terms of creating that debt over the years

94
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,720
 of doing the transformation of this building.

95
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,120
 But again, as a 38 year old taking on that,

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,300
 that was a big responsibility I placed on my shoulders.

97
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,720
 No one placed it on me other than myself.

98
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,520
 I placed that pressure of, man,

99
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,920
 I'm gonna have to perform really well

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,580
 in order for us to get rid of that debt.

101
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,160
 So that was a weight on me in those first couple of months.

102
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,560
 The other thing that happens,

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,320
 and it's kind of rough when these things happen,

104
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,520
 but oftentimes when there's a leadership transition,

105
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,000
 there's a shift, not just in the transition of leadership,

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,240
 but also in the people themselves.

107
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,160
 And so in the first two months of me leading here,

108
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,860
 20% of the church left.

109
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,980
 20% of the church left.

110
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,160
 Now, I can look back on that today

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
 and with a bit more wisdom and maturity,

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,460
 realize that that wasn't probably a personal thing

113
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,460
 directed at me, but in the moment,

114
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,920
 that felt very personal and very directed at me.

115
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,640
 And I took that reality on my shoulders

116
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,960
 and the pressure began to build inside of me.

117
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,800
 And the pressure was that John and Tony

118
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,000
 had done such a great job and had hand over to me.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
 And the worry and the concern I had was that

120
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
 in six months, in one year, in a year and a half,

121
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
 the vine will go from this great church

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,080
 that had been built by these two incredible legends

123
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,840
 to a church that was gonna crumble and disappear

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
 under my leadership.

125
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,080
 And again, I placed that stress and that burden on me.

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,040
 Now, here's what I did over the first six or so months

127
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,900
 feeling that pressure.

128
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,560
 I, of course, didn't tell anyone about it.

129
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,480
 I just sat in the privacy of my anxiety.

130
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,580
 I wonder if anyone's ever done that before.

131
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,800
 Just sat in the reality of the brokenness,

132
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,400
 the privacy of my anguish, my anxiety,

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
 the imposter syndrome.

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,640
 And here was the thing,

135
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,920
 I didn't wanna tell anyone about it

136
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
 because I wanted everybody to think

137
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,340
 that everything was fine.

138
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,000
 So I go online and watch sermons

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,720
 from back in that first year.

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
 And here's Andrew up front preaching his heart out,

141
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,360
 but I know that the Andrew inside was in great turmoil.

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,420
 And by God's amazing grace,

143
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,440
 the church managed to still grow and thrive

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,840
 even though the pastor was dealing

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,680
 with some pretty dark thoughts inside of himself.

146
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,040
 And this duality, the privacy of my anxiety

147
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,580
 and the public woo-hoo that I was on a Sunday

148
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,520
 was eating away at my soul.

149
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,080
 And I remember about a year into leading here,

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,000
 I remember just this feeling,

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,520
 it was like an air bubble was inside of me

152
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,720
 of stress and anxiety.

153
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,760
 And I felt like it was just building and building,

154
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,040
 the pressure was building and building

155
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,920
 and that I had to let it out.

156
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,800
 I had to finally do something about it.

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,040
 And I remember I got the courage to WhatsApp my wife,

158
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,200
 Christine, I didn't have the courage

159
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,160
 to talk to her about it,

160
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,880
 but I had the courage to WhatsApp her.

161
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,360
 And I WhatsAppped her and I said,

162
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,680
 we need to go out for dinner tonight.

163
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
 And she's like, "Why, what's up?"

164
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,960
 And I'm like, "I need to talk to you

165
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,320
 "about something really serious."

166
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,680
 Now my wife thinks that I'm, I don't know,

167
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,240
 like gonna talk about I'm not happy in our marriage

168
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
 or something like,

169
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,280
 so Chris is like freaking out the whole day.

170
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,080
 We get together for dinner,

171
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,440
 we're living in Discovery Bay at the time,

172
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,840
 we're in this very public restaurant,

173
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
 this big restaurant,

174
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,880
 and we sit down and immediately I just start weeping.

175
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,200
 In this big public restaurant.

176
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,400
 And not just like a little tear rolling down my cheek,

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,520
 but I'm like snot bubbles,

178
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
 kind of weeping,

179
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,960
 like just weeping and weeping.

180
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,520
 And Chris is just sitting there going like,

181
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,320
 "Oh my goodness, I don't know what's happened,

182
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,720
 "but this is serious."

183
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,000
 And I said this to her,

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,840
 I said, "Honey,"

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,520
 I said, "If I fail,

186
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,080
 "if the church continues to reduce in numbers,

187
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,840
 "if I'm the worst pastor that there has ever been,

188
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,560
 "and if I don't do a good job,

189
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,680
 "will you still love me?"

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,000
 And that question betrayed the anxiety

191
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,520
 and the faulty thinking that was inside of me.

192
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
 'Cause it was like in my mind,

193
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,200
 it was like performance earned love.

194
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,320
 So if I failed,

195
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,800
 then she has the right to hate me like everybody else

196
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,080
 and think I'm a failure and leave.

197
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,720
 But if I do well,

198
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,960
 she should love me.

199
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
 But if I fail,

200
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,160
 will you still love me?

201
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,840
 Now, of course she reached over the table

202
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,200
 and she grabbed my hands and beautifully,

203
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
 "Of course I love you, honey,

204
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,240
 "I always love you."

205
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
 It was so awesome.

206
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,480
 But she then said two things,

207
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,120
 two things that became

208
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,800
 one of those life transforming moments in your life.

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,560
 And she said these two things.

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
 She said, "First of all,

211
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
 "you need to remind yourself

212
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,640
 "that success in the kingdom of God

213
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,360
 "is not based on achievement,

214
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,000
 "but faithfulness."

215
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,240
 Yeah.

216
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,120
 (congregation applauding)

217
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,960
 And then number two,

218
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,760
 and this was weird to hear at the start,

219
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,880
 but I kind of followed with her.

220
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,120
 She said, "There are people better than you."

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,960
 Thanks, hon.

222
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
 Feel so much better now.

223
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,520
 She said, "There are people better than you.

224
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,200
 "There's gonna be some pastor out there

225
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,040
 "who's a better pastor.

226
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,000
 "There's gonna be some preacher out there

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
 "who's a better preacher.

228
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,120
 "There are people who are better than you,

229
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,280
 "but no one else has been called

230
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,320
 "to lead the vine than you."

231
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,040
 (congregation applauding)

232
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,880
 Now,

233
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,640
 those two things I knew

234
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,680
 because those two things I had held in my spirit

235
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,040
 when I came into becoming senior pastor a year before.

236
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,760
 But in the privacy of my anxiety,

237
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,040
 in the isolation that I had created

238
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,720
 by not sharing with anyone,

239
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,120
 as I had buried the reality of those two truths

240
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,520
 and allowed other thoughts to dominate in my mind,

241
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,120
 it was only after I had decided

242
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,240
 to have the courage to pop the lid,

243
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,440
 to finally be honest about what was going on inside of me,

244
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,520
 that my wife, the person that I loved the most,

245
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,560
 the person that was my trusted confidant the most,

246
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,920
 was able to speak truth

247
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,080
 that was there but deeply buried,

248
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,560
 truth that I had forgotten

249
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
 and had kind of isolated myself from.

250
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
 She was able to bring those two truths out to me,

251
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,520
 and this was a significant turning point in my life.

252
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,080
 I am not making this up when I say to you

253
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,000
 that I think the primary reason

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,280
 why I'm still standing here today and leading this church

255
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,920
 is because of that moment in that restaurant,

256
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,480
 because those words shifted something inside of me.

257
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,160
 And if I had not had the courage

258
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,720
 to finally be honest about what was going on in here,

259
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,480
 I don't think I would have lasted.

260
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,080
 And as she said, it's not about achievement but faithfulness.

261
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,040
 You're called and you have to hang on to that calling,

262
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
 even though you might see things going on,

263
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,840
 you've gotta hang on to that calling.

264
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,240
 Those words brought life.

265
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,680
 My most significant journey of personal transformation

266
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,200
 started that evening.

267
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,640
 Now, it didn't happen all quick.

268
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,840
 It wasn't suddenly like, "Oh, imposter syndrome, gone.

269
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 "All that anxiety, gone.

270
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,320
 "$25 million debt, gone," right?

271
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,720
 There was a journey, of course.

272
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,760
 That journey was a long one.

273
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,120
 I went into counseling,

274
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,600
 and I needed counseling to deal with my anxiety.

275
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,960
 I confessed with some brothers, and I have Hudson's here,

276
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
 some really good brothers of mine

277
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,600
 who are accountable partners that I pray with regularly

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,760
 and confess with them,

279
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,920
 and they stood and prayed for me as well.

280
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,280
 It was a journey of Chris and I in our marriage

281
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,080
 reconstituting what was going on there

282
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,760
 because in that year, I had isolated her

283
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
 from some of the deep things.

284
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
 So there was a journey of healing,

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,800
 but it started because there was a significant pivot

286
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,400
 that took place when I went from a place of private anguish

287
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,240
 to public confession.

288
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,120
 As we continue our journey in personal transformation

289
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,080
 in this theme that we're in over these weeks,

290
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,120
 looking at the book of Ezra,

291
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
 and particularly Ezra chapter three,

292
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,320
 where Israel has come out of their brokenness in Babylon.

293
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,200
 They've come back into a place of standing in that ruins

294
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,240
 and the rubble of the old temple that had been destroyed.

295
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,600
 And in chapter three of Ezra,

296
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,780
 we see this beautiful picture of the builders coming out

297
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,520
 with the cornerstones and placing the first stones down

298
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,860
 for the rebuilding of the second temple.

299
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,820
 In that story, we see seven words,

300
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,320
 seven words that I believe for some of you here today

301
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,880
 are gonna be a pivotable transformation moment in your life.

302
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,640
 Simple seven words that I think if you can understand

303
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,160
 the truth behind these words,

304
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
 could be a little bit like what it was like for me

305
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,000
 to sit in that dinner and hear my wife speak truth into me.

306
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,360
 Perhaps God's word wants to speak some truth into you today.

307
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,120
 This series so far has been helpful for you.

308
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,720
 If you've been thinking and reflecting

309
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,040
 over the last couple of weeks about the rubble within you,

310
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,140
 if you're praying and longing for that rubble to be renewed,

311
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,920
 my prayer is that these seven words

312
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,320
 would set your heart today alight.

313
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,160
 Let me read this to you.

314
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,840
 I'm gonna jump back a few verses

315
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,360
 so that we can stay connected to the bigger picture

316
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
 of what we're looking at.

317
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
 This is Ezra three, starting in verse 11.

318
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,040
 And all of the people gave a great shout of praise

319
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,640
 to the Lord because the foundations

320
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,520
 of the house of the Lord was laid.

321
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,160
 But many of the older priests and Levites

322
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,840
 and the family heads who had seen the former temple

323
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,320
 wept aloud when they saw the foundations

324
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,540
 of this temple being laid.

325
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,080
 While many others shouted for joy,

326
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,180
 no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy

327
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,600
 from the sound of weeping

328
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,380
 because the people made so much noise.

329
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,820
 Here are the seven words.

330
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,540
 And the sound was heard far away.

331
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,380
 Let me say it again.

332
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,340
 And the sound was heard far away.

333
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,740
 Father, as we open up this just small segment

334
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,500
 of scripture here this morning,

335
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,620
 I wanna pray that you would do something significant

336
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,940
 for each of us and we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

337
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,780
 Everyone says.

338
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,100
 - Amen. - Amen.

339
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,460
 Ezra describes this crazy moment.

340
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,380
 We saw it last week, the power that there was

341
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,860
 in a community worshiping and weeping side by side.

342
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,920
 And we taught last week that that is the sound

343
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,420
 of restoration, this invitation to be able to be honest

344
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
 with what's happening in our lives.

345
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,460
 And Ezra describes that that sound is so loud,

346
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,020
 it is so powerful that it mixes together

347
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,300
 so that no one can distinguish between the either.

348
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,420
 It's like this harmony of sound is created

349
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,520
 where no one can tell the individual parts,

350
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,220
 but it's just this loud noise.

351
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,620
 And it's such a loud noise that in these final seven words

352
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,620
 of the verse, Ezra says, and the sound was heard far away.

353
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,060
 Now that might seem like a simple thing.

354
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,280
 It might seem like a bit of a throwaway line,

355
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,700
 perhaps when we study scripture, we read things like this

356
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,740
 and we just kind of skip over it quite quickly.

357
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,940
 But I think Ezra is wanting to root us

358
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,340
 into something that is significant in any journey

359
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,780
 of personal transformation.

360
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,740
 Here's what he's saying.

361
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,340
 He's saying, well, the transformation process for Israel

362
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,380
 was a personal concern, it was not a private matter.

363
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,300
 I want you to notice this.

364
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,660
 Ezra's saying the sound of that weeping and worship

365
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,580
 went out far away.

366
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,300
 There were people far from Jerusalem who could hear it,

367
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,980
 who could sense it, who were like,

368
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,340
 what's that noise, intrigue to discover and find out more.

369
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,700
 And while the process of transformation from Israel

370
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,700
 was personal, deeply personal, it was not private,

371
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,180
 which should challenge all of us because so often

372
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,500
 one of the reasons that we use to stay private

373
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,540
 about the stuff in our lives is because it's personal.

374
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,780
 Come on church.

375
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,420
 It's like, I'm not gonna talk to anybody about this

376
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,100
 because it's super personal.

377
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
 Like it's super personal and what's going on in my life

378
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,660
 and it's personal to me and so I'm gonna remain private.

379
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,220
 This was one of the most personal moments

380
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,060
 in Israel's history.

381
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,660
 We saw last week that the reason why they're weeping

382
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,020
 is because God has shown them and reminded them

383
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,740
 about their brokenness, about some of the choices

384
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,660
 that they had made in the past and the consequences

385
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,860
 of those choices in their present.

386
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,540
 And when they look at the rubble,

387
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,500
 they're connecting their personal choices in the past

388
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,900
 to the personal reality of what's happening there.

389
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,860
 And it tears them up inside and they start weeping

390
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,500
 because they realize what their choices have created

391
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,340
 in their lives.

392
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,180
 Nothing more personal than that.

393
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,460
 And then there's this other group who are praising

394
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,220
 and cheering and are so excited because they see

395
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,300
 that God's redemptive and restorative work is now at play.

396
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,020
 And they're beginning to worship and they're beginning

397
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,060
 to sing praises and these two things are happening there

398
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,860
 because these two things are the reality

399
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,420
 of what's happening in that moment.

400
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,620
 And as it goes, even though it's incredibly personal,

401
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,980
 they are not trying to sweep it under the rug

402
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,820
 and pretend like it hadn't happened.

403
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,460
 They are exclaiming even the shame of what they have done,

404
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,540
 but they are not ashamed to proclaim that reality

405
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,860
 in their lives.

406
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,900
 It was personal, but not private.

407
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,100
 It was happening to them,

408
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,700
 but there were others who could encounter it.

409
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,700
 It was their experience, but it was not just their story.

410
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,500
 It's fascinating because as I've just shared personally

411
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,820
 out of my own life, I think that's all of our lives

412
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,540
 to a certain degree.

413
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,140
 I think when there's stuff going on in us,

414
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,940
 there's rubble within us that we're aware of.

415
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,540
 When we're going on a journey of healing,

416
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,300
 when we're still feeling sensitive from that brokenness,

417
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,060
 when the trauma is real, when the anxiety is being felt,

418
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,220
 when the fear is upon us, us, all of us,

419
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,380
 our natural temptation, our natural tendency

420
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,060
 is just to try to keep it from everybody else.

421
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,540
 Just try to be private about it, try to bury it,

422
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,260
 try to just kind of push it away.

423
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,340
 And at least on the surface, just try to make sure

424
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,940
 that everybody else thinks that we're perfectly fine.

425
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,500
 We have this danger as humans

426
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,020
 to almost want to do that naturally.

427
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,300
 Just take that pain, bury it as much as possible.

428
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,900
 And as long as I come in on a Sunday,

429
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,180
 raise my hand, sing songs,

430
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,820
 and if anybody asks me, how are you?

431
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,860
 I'm great.

432
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,660
 When actually the reality is inside, I'm dying.

433
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,780
 That there's something in here that I can't wrestle with,

434
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,460
 and I'm just trying to isolate myself from it.

435
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,820
 And it feels like I'm pulling away from everybody around me.

436
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,180
 Now, don't hear me wrong.

437
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,380
 I'm not advocating that you do the exact opposite of that

438
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,340
 at every moment of your life.

439
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,220
 Trust me, it is not wise to put your whole life on display

440
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,420
 for absolutely everybody to see.

441
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,700
 Like, oh, Pastor Andrew, he preached about taking things

442
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,980
 that are private and making them public.

443
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,260
 Okay, well, then I need to tell everybody everything

444
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,100
 that I ever meet.

445
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,620
 I'm gonna put all my dirty laundry out for everybody to see.

446
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,220
 If you go to work tomorrow, come on, church.

447
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,300
 If you go to work tomorrow and say,

448
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
 oh, I'm gonna put Pastor Andrew's message

449
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,660
 into application in my life,

450
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,100
 and I'm finally gonna tell my boss

451
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,980
 everything I really think about them.

452
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,300
 You will not have a job, okay, on Tuesday.

453
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,180
 Are you with me?

454
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,980
 So we need to be wise, of course, about how we do this,

455
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,460
 about who we share with, when we share, and how we share.

456
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,820
 We don't swing the pendulum to the other way and go,

457
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,660
 everybody needs to know everything about me

458
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,620
 that has ever happened.

459
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,540
 That's not a healthy place to be.

460
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,500
 But here's the thing.

461
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,060
 As human beings, as Christians, we do the opposite thing,

462
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,660
 the opposite extreme more,

463
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,100
 which is rather than tell everybody about everything,

464
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,260
 we don't tell anybody about anything at all.

465
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,980
 And we push it down, we suppress it, we bury it,

466
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,780
 and we come and we do our thing,

467
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,380
 but nobody actually knows what's truly going on inside.

468
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,340
 And we kind of operate out of that place.

469
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,060
 And here's why we do it.

470
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,180
 And this is so ironic.

471
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,500
 We do it because we think this,

472
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,660
 if people truly knew what was inside of me,

473
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,740
 if they truly knew what I thought about things,

474
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,420
 if they truly knew the things that I've done,

475
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,180
 if they truly knew the pain that I'm wrestling with,

476
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,260
 if they truly understood my thought life,

477
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,460
 well, they wouldn't wanna be my friend anymore.

478
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,860
 They would turn away and they would isolate me.

479
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,180
 They would distance themselves from me.

480
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,420
 I would lose my community.

481
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,780
 I would lose my spouse.

482
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,420
 I would lose everything in my life.

483
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,700
 And so we're so afraid that if we are honest,

484
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,380
 people will isolate us.

485
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,940
 Here's what we do ironically.

486
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,060
 We choose to isolate ourselves.

487
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,300
 Do you follow that?

488
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,380
 So we think if I share,

489
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,900
 people are gonna back away and isolate myself.

490
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,540
 So instead we bury within ourselves.

491
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,620
 We choose ourselves to isolate ourselves.

492
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,780
 And on the surface, pretend like everything's fine.

493
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,780
 And we end up living in a duality that is not sustainable.

494
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,380
 A duality of private, brokenness, pain, anxiety, whatever,

495
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,220
 and public, how are you doing?

496
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,180
 And these two things wear down your soul over time.

497
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,460
 Listen to this.

498
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,300
 When your external behavior operates in tension

499
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,780
 to your internal reality,

500
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,900
 you will always end up having more rubble

501
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,460
 and less transformation in your life.

502
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,980
 Come on church.

503
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,860
 When your external behavior operates intention

504
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,060
 to what is actually true inside of you,

505
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,180
 everything's great.

506
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,500
 No, it's absolutely not.

507
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,300
 And that lasts over an extended period of time.

508
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
 Here's what will happen.

509
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,660
 You will basically deteriorate in your mental,

510
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,900
 in your emotional, and in your spiritual health,

511
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,820
 which will also have an impact on your physical health

512
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,740
 'cause we're holistic beings.

513
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,380
 Here's Israel,

514
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,700
 and they're going through some deep personal things.

515
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,420
 Things that are making them weep

516
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,980
 as well as things that are making them praise.

517
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,700
 And here's what happens.

518
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,060
 Those that needed to weep, wept.

519
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,300
 Those that needed to praise, praised.

520
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,180
 In other words, Israel made a decision

521
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,500
 that they were gonna ensure that their external behavior

522
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,420
 actually corresponded to their internal reality.

523
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,420
 So those that were in pain, those that were grieving,

524
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,700
 those that were feeling bad for the sin that had happened,

525
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,380
 those that were dealing with the consequences of brokenness,

526
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,900
 they wept.

527
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,620
 Those who could see the forgiveness of the Lord,

528
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,940
 who saw the start of a new season,

529
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,780
 who were excited that God was gonna do something for them,

530
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,300
 they began to praise.

531
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,500
 And both had space to be who they were.

532
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,820
 Both, could be honest.

533
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,460
 They didn't need to bury.

534
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,780
 They didn't need to be private.

535
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,860
 They didn't need some duality of life.

536
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,220
 The sound of restoration was made loud and clear,

537
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,060
 and it was beginning to change them.

538
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,860
 And here's what their honesty created.

539
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,620
 It created two things.

540
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,780
 First of all, it created an environment

541
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,980
 by which they could have a personal community

542
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,060
 of comfort and healing.

543
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,420
 And secondly, it created an environment

544
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,300
 in which they could have a public place

545
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,700
 of hope and restoration.

546
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,780
 And any work of renewal in your life

547
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,140
 and in a community's life like this,

548
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,100
 if it's truly gonna have effective impact,

549
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,140
 these two things have to be operating in that place

550
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,300
 at the same time.

551
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,260
 A place of comfort and healing,

552
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,700
 a place of hope and restoration.

553
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,260
 And the thing that makes those two things

554
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,900
 is that courage to take what is buried within,

555
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,580
 and with wisdom and being smart about it,

556
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,700
 offer it to those that we trust.

557
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,260
 Let's start with the first one.

558
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,420
 See, Israel understood that as they allowed the space

559
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,460
 for people to weep and for people to pray,

560
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,260
 everybody had a place.

561
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,140
 And that because of that,

562
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,980
 they weren't burying anything inside of them.

563
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,140
 They were opening it up, letting it out,

564
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
 getting it up there.

565
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,740
 They were surrounded by this group of people

566
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,540
 who would be able to come alongside of them and go,

567
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,020
 "Hey, I see that.

568
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,860
 "I feel that.

569
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,100
 "I've felt that too.

570
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,460
 "I've dealt with that too.

571
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,980
 "Hey, can I pray with you?

572
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,100
 "Can I stand with you?

573
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,820
 "Can I create space with you?"

574
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,580
 It's really interesting.

575
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,940
 You gotta understand it this way.

576
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,580
 When you come into relationship with Jesus,

577
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,580
 you don't just come into relationship with Him,

578
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,500
 but also relationship with His people.

579
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,940
 This is what church is all about.

580
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,020
 When we are saved,

581
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,820
 we're not just saved into a new relationship with the Lord,

582
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,780
 we're saved into a relationship with one another.

583
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,340
 And God has created gatherings like this,

584
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,900
 church experience in the ways in which we do it,

585
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,420
 in multifaceted ways.

586
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,740
 He's created it.

587
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,860
 And He said, "Look, I'm gonna bless it with my spirit.

588
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,820
 "And although, yes, you can open the Bible,

589
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,100
 "read a word and be encouraged.

590
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,540
 "Yes, you can come in, sing some songs,

591
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,220
 "and I'll speak to you by my spirit.

592
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,580
 "Some of the most powerful transformative moments

593
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,740
 "that the Spirit will do in your life,

594
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,980
 "He will do through somebody else in your life."

595
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,580
 And as we embrace the reality of what God has given us,

596
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,140
 when we have the courage to not isolate ourselves

597
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,620
 from the body of Christ,

598
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,460
 true change and transformation really takes place.

599
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,140
 See, you are not saved

600
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,420
 into a private redemptive ticket to heaven.

601
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,900
 You're saved into a public here family,

602
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,860
 redemptive family on earth.

603
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,820
 And God, by His great spirit and His grace

604
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,020
 and the work of Jesus has adopted us into that family.

605
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,660
 And we now have millions of brothers and sisters

606
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,780
 all over the world.

607
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,340
 Did you know that God has no grandchildren?

608
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,660
 Come on, church, work it out.

609
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,500
 God has no grandchildren.

610
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,180
 He has sons and daughters, His children in a family.

611
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,020
 We're that family.

612
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,660
 It's not a redemptive ticket out of here.

613
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,060
 Some private, "Oh my gosh,

614
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,460
 "now I'm in a good relationship with Jesus, I'm saved."

615
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,380
 Our salvation drives us towards one another

616
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,500
 in this beautiful redemptive family,

617
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,860
 whereas brothers and sisters,

618
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,580
 we get to stand with each other and walk with each other

619
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,340
 in some of the hardest moments of life.

620
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,180
 This is why Paul, when he's writing to the church

621
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,500
 in Romans 12, 15, he says it this way.

622
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,620
 He says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice,

623
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,380
 "weep with those who weep."

624
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,500
 A beautiful invitation for the body of Christ

625
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,260
 to be the body of Christ to one another.

626
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,380
 Later in 1 Corinthians 12, 16, I think it is,

627
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,020
 he says this, he says, "Look,

628
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,500
 "if any member of the body is suffering,

629
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,220
 "we're all suffering with them."

630
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,380
 In other words, don't you understand

631
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,140
 how integrated and connected we are,

632
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,420
 that God has created the church to be a place

633
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,980
 where we rejoice with those who rejoice,

634
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,220
 weep with those who weep,

635
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,820
 where when one suffers, we all suffer,

636
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,860
 and we come together in healing and restoration

637
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,580
 and comfort and joy and love.

638
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,060
 And when people can be honest and say,

639
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,820
 "You know what, this is a safe place

640
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,860
 "for me to let out some of this stuff

641
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,620
 "that I've been bearing and bearing,

642
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,420
 "true transformation takes place."

643
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,460
 Notice what it says, "Rejoice with those who are rejoicing,

644
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,660
 "weep with those who are weeping."

645
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,580
 It does not say when somebody confesses something

646
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,020
 or opens their lives up,

647
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,820
 that your job is to try to just cheer them up

648
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,500
 or that your job is to correct their theology.

649
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,100
 It says your job is to meet them in their emotion

650
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,340
 and sit with them in it.

651
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,100
 Rejoice if they're rejoicing,

652
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,260
 weep if they're weeping,

653
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,020
 find a place of connection and sit with them

654
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:18,100
 because they need, they've taken all this courage to,

655
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,420
 I mean, imagine if my wife had leant across the table

656
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,020
 and she said, "Just suck it up."

657
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,540
 Or if she'd leant across the table and said,

658
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,420
 "Let me just open up Luke chapter 15."

659
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,860
 (congregation laughing)

660
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,700
 Right?

661
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,900
 But we do that to one another.

662
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,100
 That's part of the reason why sometimes

663
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,900
 we keep things buried and we don't share

664
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,500
 'cause maybe we have shared in the past

665
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
 and somebody responded in a way

666
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,460
 that wasn't what we were thinking,

667
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
 wasn't what we were expecting,

668
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,500
 and it's hurt us even more

669
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,860
 and we buried and buried and buried.

670
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,660
 We've all had those kinds of experiences,

671
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,500
 but it doesn't stop Paul writing to the church

672
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,380
 and it doesn't stop me standing here before you today

673
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,300
 and saying, "We have to push beyond those bad experiences."

674
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,860
 That just 'cause somebody didn't respond how I thought,

675
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,020
 doesn't mean the next time I do it, it's gonna be the same.

676
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,580
 No, I still have the pain.

677
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,620
 I need someone to pray for me, stand with me, support me.

678
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,020
 Jesus himself did this.

679
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,020
 The night in the Garden of Gethsemane,

680
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,340
 his greatest personal trial and challenge,

681
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,220
 knowing that the cross was just a few days away,

682
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,540
 he brings, notice this,

683
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,420
 he brings all the disciples with him

684
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,820
 to the Mount of Olives to pray.

685
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,980
 But then Matthew tells us,

686
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,980
 he takes his three best friends, James and John and Peter,

687
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,900
 and he takes them a little bit further

688
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,060
 and he says these words.

689
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,460
 He says, "Stay with me, pray for me, pray and guard,

690
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,940
 pray against temptation.

691
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,660
 I need you to stand with me."

692
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,940
 'Cause he's like, he's about to sweat blood.

693
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,540
 He's in a place of deep personal anguish.

694
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,540
 Jesus understood this was a personal journey,

695
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,780
 but not a private matter.

696
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,100
 Come on church.

697
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,180
 And so he demonstrates to us, the son of God,

698
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,780
 that he needed his best friends praying

699
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,900
 and standing with him, supporting and speaking life into him

700
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,780
 to get him through the darkness of that hour.

701
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,540
 Now, the reality is they fell asleep.

702
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,940
 That's a whole nother story.

703
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,100
 That's a whole nother sermon.

704
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,660
 We're not gonna go there right now.

705
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,580
 But do you see what he's demonstrating to the church?

706
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,460
 Some of you here are in the body of Christ,

707
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,180
 but you are remaining distant and private

708
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,020
 from the very people God has placed around you.

709
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,300
 Jesus didn't do it, neither should you.

710
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,580
 Here's the second thing.

711
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,660
 The second thing is, as Israel begins to be honest

712
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,940
 about the reality in their lives,

713
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,380
 as they weep and they worship,

714
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,340
 as they have one another to bring that comfort in life,

715
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,100
 it's not just that healing and restoration

716
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,260
 that happens for them.

717
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,660
 Others are able to now hear and see and go,

718
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,780
 hang on a sec, something significant is happening over there

719
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,700
 and something's beginning to change.

720
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,780
 What is that?

721
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,940
 That's interesting.

722
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
 And they can be drawn.

723
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
 We don't have time to look at it today,

724
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,260
 but if you follow on with the rest of the story,

725
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,740
 the other nations begin to hear of the transformative work

726
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,820
 that's happening in Israel,

727
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,020
 and some of them get scared and wanna fight back,

728
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,180
 like we'll see next week.

729
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,460
 Others are drawn near and wanting to understand,

730
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,180
 is there really a God who can change and transform us?

731
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,340
 The beautiful thing about a redemptive community

732
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,740
 who are willing to walk in their pain openly

733
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
 before trusted people in their lives

734
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,740
 is that it creates hope for those who are a long way off.

735
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,540
 God changes you, not just because he wants to change you.

736
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:37,180
 He changes you because he longs to change your family member,

737
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,140
 your colleague, the person that you're dating,

738
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,020
 the whatever it might be.

739
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,020
 Our own transformation is always in God's hands

740
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,340
 for him to use as a demonstration.

741
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:59,980
 Every work of private renewal has potential public power.

742
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,580
 That's again, what God does in a community like this.

743
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,860
 He creates a church and he brings us together

744
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,740
 so that our sound would be heard far away.

745
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,060
 So that when we testify about the transformation

746
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,540
 that the Lord has done in our lives,

747
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,420
 where we stand publicly and say there was anxiety

748
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,660
 and there was pain and I shared with someone

749
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,220
 and they prayed with me and I changed my tune

750
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,180
 and I began to see myself differently,

751
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,020
 I began to see the world differently.

752
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:36,620
 This is the sound that people outside are desperate to hear.

753
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,780
 The ones who are seeing the world's news

754
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,620
 and they're saying,

755
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,820
 "Is anything good ever gonna come in this world?"

756
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,780
 The one who are seeing their stocks

757
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,060
 and their investments go down and are thinking,

758
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,260
 "Is there anything more to life

759
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,060
 than what I'm experiencing right now?"

760
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,860
 And if the church is making the sound of restoration

761
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,620
 and the only people that can hear it

762
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,260
 are the ones in this room right now, we are not church.

763
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,100
 What's the point?

764
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,380
 Jesus didn't die on the cross

765
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,660
 for the church to be a holy huddle.

766
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,580
 He didn't die on the cross

767
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,980
 so the church could be some thing on the hill

768
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,300
 far away from the world.

769
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,980
 He died on the cross so that the sound of restoration

770
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,820
 would be heard by those far away.

771
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,420
 That the thing that the Lord has done in your life,

772
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,300
 no longer suppressed but spoken out of

773
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,500
 and given hope, brought light into,

774
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,100
 could be the very thing that might bring them new life.

775
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,780
 There is always transformative power

776
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,980
 in the public witness of a private renewal.

777
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,380
 That's a summary of the book of Acts,

778
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,540
 if there ever has been one.

779
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,260
 At the book of Acts at the beginning, Jesus says,

780
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,660
 "You're gonna go from here filled with my spirit

781
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,820
 so that you would be my what?

782
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,540
 My witnesses.

783
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,220
 So that what I've done in you would be seen in the world

784
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,500
 so that others might find hope in that reality.

785
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,180
 There is always transformative power

786
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,620
 in the public witness of a private renewal.

787
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,620
 But any time we keep it all buried,

788
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,140
 we're diminishing the sound

789
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,860
 that was meant to be heard far away.

790
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,420
 I wanna read you just something that Paul says

791
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,620
 in 2 Corinthians as he's trying to kind of picture this

792
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,940
 to his church.

793
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,900
 He says these beautiful words in 2 Corinthians 1 verse 3.

794
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,020
 He says, "Praise be to the God and the Father

795
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,540
 of our Lord Jesus Christ,

796
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,140
 the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,

797
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,780
 who comforts us in our troubles

798
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,500
 so that we can comfort only ourselves in private

799
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,740
 in our services.

800
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,060
 Who comforts us in our troubles

801
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,420
 so that we can comfort those in any trouble

802
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,980
 with the comfort that we ourselves have received from God."

803
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,340
 When we read a passage like that,

804
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,540
 we think Paul is actually speaking specifically

805
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,380
 about the church.

806
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,420
 Of course, he's speaking into the church,

807
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,340
 but he's using language here where he's saying,

808
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,060
 "Don't you understand that in the church,

809
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,500
 when you experience that comfort and that renewal

810
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,500
 in your life, you are then able to comfort any trouble,

811
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,620
 any person who's got trouble."

812
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,660
 He's not saying just those in church who believe in Jesus

813
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,860
 and sing Kumbaya with you on a Sunday.

814
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,900
 He's saying anyone who has trouble,

815
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,860
 who is struggling when Christ comforts you.

816
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,180
 There is a overflow of that comfort

817
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,500
 that is not just for those that believe in Jesus,

818
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,140
 but it's for those that are desperately in need of Jesus.

819
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,420
 And that as we begin to operate in a place

820
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,420
 of public release to the private renewal,

821
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:42,380
 the church becomes the church.

822
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,300
 One of my favorite stories in Jesus' ministry

823
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,660
 is this moment where Jesus is walking through the crowds

824
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,180
 and the crowds by this point,

825
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,620
 he's been ministering for some time

826
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,900
 and the crowds have grown and grown and grown.

827
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,100
 And in fact, he's still in Galilee

828
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,460
 and he's still surrounded daily by these crowds.

829
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,980
 And everybody's trying to get a piece of Jesus.

830
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,900
 Everybody's trying to clamber onto him,

831
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,620
 press around him, try to get a hold of him.

832
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,100
 And in this story, a woman who had been bleeding

833
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,460
 for 12 years, the kind of bleeding that meant

834
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,220
 that she was ceremonial unclean all the time,

835
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,860
 meant that she was cast as an outcast in her community.

836
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,580
 The sort of bleeding that you would wanna keep

837
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,380
 very, very private, not let anyone know about it,

838
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,700
 not talk about it with anyone.

839
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,620
 This woman, she hears that Jesus has done miracles

840
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,180
 around Galilee and she's heard the stories

841
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,460
 that he might be the Messiah

842
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,220
 that the Jewish people have been longing for.

843
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,060
 And the Bible tells us that in faith,

844
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,980
 she decides this one can heal me.

845
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,020
 I believe that he is the Messiah.

846
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,460
 I believe he can set me free.

847
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,380
 And in that faith and belief,

848
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,300
 she decides to press through the crowds

849
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,100
 so that she could just get a hold of Jesus.

850
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,580
 Let me actually read this to you from Luke chapter eight.

851
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,420
 And we're gonna pick up the story.

852
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,260
 Says this, "As Jesus was on his way,

853
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,740
 "the crowds almost crushed him.

854
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,700
 "And a woman was there who had been subject

855
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,500
 "to bleeding for 12 years, but no one could heal her.

856
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,180
 "She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak

857
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,140
 "and immediately her bleeding stopped.

858
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,460
 "Who touched me? Jesus asked.

859
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,060
 "When they all denied it, Peter said,

860
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,900
 "Master, the people are all crowding

861
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,660
 "and pressing against you.

862
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,340
 "But Jesus said, no, someone touched me.

863
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,540
 "I know because power has gone out from me.

864
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,060
 "Then the woman saying that she could not go unnoticed

865
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,980
 "came trembling and fell at his feet.

866
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,780
 "In the presence of all the people,

867
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,020
 "she told why she had touched him

868
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,660
 "and how she had been instantly healed.

869
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,540
 "And then he said to her in the public

870
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,460
 "in front of everybody,

871
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,380
 "daughter, your faith has healed you.

872
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,100
 "Go in peace."

873
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,020
 There's this moment where she has the audacity of courage

874
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,060
 to reach out and as he's walking by,

875
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,780
 just grasp the hem of his cloak.

876
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,420
 And Jesus stops immediately.

877
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,620
 And as she's doing this, as she grasped that cloak,

878
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,140
 she's immediately healed.

879
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,860
 It's really important that you understand this.

880
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,980
 She's immediately healed.

881
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,220
 It's not like she's gotta go through

882
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,220
 some journey of healing.

883
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,380
 In this particular moment,

884
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,620
 she's instantly, immediately healed.

885
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,300
 Jesus stops and says, "Who touched me?"

886
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,140
 To which Peter, in the blunt way that Peter always is,

887
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,260
 is, "Dude, everybody's touching you."

888
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,900
 Like, can't you see the whole crowd around you?

889
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,660
 Like, are you mad, Jesus?

890
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,140
 Like, everybody's pressing in on you.

891
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,260
 Everybody's, what do you mean?

892
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:34,100
 Who's touching?

893
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,300
 "We're all touching you," Peter said.

894
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,620
 And Jesus is like, "No, power has gone out from me.

895
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,460
 "Who's touched me?"

896
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,540
 Now, notice this.

897
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,020
 He's doing this and he's placing this woman

898
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,060
 in a place of decision.

899
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:52,540
 She does not need to come forward for further healing.

900
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,940
 She's already received our holy.

901
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,180
 She's instantly healed.

902
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,100
 In other words, she's got what she's come for.

903
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
 So she could go, "You know what?

904
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,740
 "I'm just gonna privately go back into my little hovel.

905
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,500
 "I'm gonna retreat from this moment.

906
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,860
 "I don't need any more of Jesus.

907
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,580
 "He's done what he needs to do in me.

908
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,420
 "I could get away.

909
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,980
 "I'm just gonna slip away."

910
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,180
 Jesus is like, "No, no, no.

911
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,300
 "You've received your healing,

912
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,140
 "but there's something else now that I want you to do."

913
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,700
 And she realizes that she can't escape.

914
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,620
 So she comes forward and she begins to testify.

915
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,460
 We don't have the words.

916
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,580
 I wish we did.

917
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,100
 But she begins to testify about what she believed Jesus was

918
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,740
 and the faith that she had and the touching of his cloak

919
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,140
 and how she had been instantly healed.

920
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,460
 And you can imagine the other people standing around

921
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,980
 and they're going, "But I've been touching him

922
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,380
 "and I haven't been healed."

923
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,180
 Now, this is why Jesus does what he does next.

924
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,060
 This is so cool.

925
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,340
 He calls her forward in front of everybody for two reasons.

926
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,780
 One, her bleeding has ceremonially made her unclean

927
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,700
 in her community.

928
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,300
 So by bringing her forward and her testifying to her,

929
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,220
 her healing, Jesus was restoring her back to her community.

930
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,460
 You can go back to this community.

931
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,820
 You can now grow with this community.

932
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,900
 They can accept you again.

933
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,740
 So this is a public restoration for her

934
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,660
 back to her community.

935
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,500
 That's great.

936
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,700
 But that's actually not the main thing

937
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,620
 I think Jesus is doing here.

938
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,780
 There's this other thing.

939
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,540
 He's now getting her to become the main preach point

940
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,380
 to the crowd.

941
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,940
 Because the crowd is thinking we're touching Jesus

942
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,180
 and nothing's happened.

943
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,100
 She's touched Jesus and she got her healing.

944
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,940
 Why?

945
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,260
 And Jesus says, "Go in peace

946
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,460
 "because your faith has healed you."

947
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,020
 Jesus is basically saying there's a difference crowd

948
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,020
 between touching me without faith and touching me with faith.

949
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,820
 And he uses her testimony to be the thing

950
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,060
 that he really wanted to say.

951
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,380
 It wasn't actually about her healing,

952
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,380
 as amazing as that was for her.

953
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,460
 That's great.

954
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,580
 But it was this teaching point

955
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,180
 that her testimony was releasing.

956
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,420
 Some of you in this room,

957
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,580
 your journey of personal transformation

958
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,460
 is going to be a testimony

959
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,460
 that the crowds around you need to hear.

960
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,020
 That Jesus wants to say and do and operate

961
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,820
 in the people around you in ways

962
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,580
 that are gonna be totally transformative in the future

963
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:11,580
 as you take the courage to testify

964
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
 what the Lord has done.

965
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,820
 We have to be wise about it.

966
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,860
 We don't go bashing people over the head with a Bible

967
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,780
 at every opportunity we have.

968
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,100
 As you trust the Lord,

969
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,180
 he will open up avenues for you to come forward

970
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,660
 and say, "This is what happened to me."

971
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,340
 Some of you in this room,

972
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,460
 your journey of personal transformation will only begin

973
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,420
 and the pivot will happen for you

974
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,820
 when you stop living the duality life

975
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,700
 of private anguish that no one knows about

976
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,380
 and public everything is fine.

977
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,220
 Some of you this week,

978
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,700
 you're gonna be taking a major step of courage,

979
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,460
 but a major step to the renewal

980
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,980
 that the Lord wants to do in your life

981
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,740
 by saying, "I am tired of living as two people."

982
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,700
 You need wisdom as to who to share with.

983
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,220
 You need to work out what the Lord wants you to do

984
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,860
 and how to do it.

985
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,860
 But there is someone in your life

986
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,740
 that the Lord will bring to your mind

987
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,060
 if you pray that prayer honestly

988
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,460
 that you should open up to this week.

989
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,660
 And in doing that,

990
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,060
 you are exposing what the enemy has kept in darkness

991
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,540
 and you're allowing light,

992
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,660
 the light of Christ to flood into it.

993
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,740
 As we confess our sin,

994
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,500
 as we confess our brokenness,

995
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,140
 as we even confess just the hurt and the pain,

996
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,340
 God heals us through one another.

997
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,460
 So some of you this week,

998
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,500
 that's the pivot point for you

999
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,300
 to stop saying, "I don't wanna live like this anymore."

1000
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,220
 I'm gonna have the courage to say, "I need help.

1001
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,660
 Would you pray for me?

1002
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,420
 Can you understand this?"

1003
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,260
 And I wanna encourage you that if you're the person

1004
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,460
 that person turns to,

1005
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,300
 rejoice with those rejoice

1006
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,740
 and weep with those who weep.

1007
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,740
 Just be with them.

1008
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,620
 Be with them, pray for them,

1009
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,500
 stand with them, love them.

1010
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,540
 And some of you here,

1011
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,340
 you've got a testimony to say.

1012
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,060
 You've got a proclamation of praise.

1013
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,060
 You've gone through a private renewal

1014
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,460
 and now is a chance that God might be explaining

1015
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,580
 and putting before you for some public proclamation

1016
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,300
 of what's privately happened within you.

1017
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,220
 Look and pray for the opportunities

1018
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,980
 and we will see many people respond

1019
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,980
 to the sound of restoration.

1020
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,820
 Amen?

1021
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,260
 Helpful?

1022
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,380
 All right, let's pray.

1023
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,420
 Father, I just thank you so much

1024
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,820
 for each person here this morning

1025
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,580
 in this journey of Ezra and transformation

1026
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,140
 that we're on here at the Vine.

1027
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,860
 And as you just quieten your hearts

1028
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,220
 and as you bow your heads,

1029
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:53,140
 perhaps for some of you,

1030
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,660
 you know that there is immediately an area of your life

1031
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,380
 that you've kept very private.

1032
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,700
 As I've explained in the message,

1033
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,540
 we do that for many reasons, fear,

1034
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:05,340
 sensitive somebody would know they would reject us,

1035
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,220
 perhaps just the shame of what it is that we're carrying

1036
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,700
 and we've buried it deeply.

1037
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,740
 And we thought we could get away with it.

1038
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,420
 We thought we could live a double life.

1039
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,820
 We thought that that would be fine,

1040
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,660
 but we know it's wearing on our soul.

1041
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,700
 We know that our mental, emotional,

1042
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,700
 spiritual life is deteriorating.

1043
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,180
 And just like me a year into being senior pastor,

1044
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,220
 there's this bubble coming up out of you

1045
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,700
 and you're like, I can't hold this anymore.

1046
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,020
 I'm so tired of it.

1047
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,940
 I'm so tired of living a double life.

1048
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:42,020
 I wanna pray that if that's you here this morning,

1049
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,860
 whether online, in this room, in the overflow,

1050
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,580
 I wanna pray now that the Holy Spirit would show you

1051
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,460
 the person for you to share with.

1052
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,860
 As you're in this moment,

1053
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,500
 the person for you to share with.

1054
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,340
 And I pray that He would give you the courage

1055
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,500
 to do it this week.

1056
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,340
 And I wanna pray the blood of Jesus

1057
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,540
 over every conversation,

1058
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:07,020
 over every exposing of the darkness

1059
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,780
 because the enemy will not like it.

1060
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,180
 And as you leave here today,

1061
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,180
 you might be feeling in this moment,

1062
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,020
 yeah, I wanna do it.

1063
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,420
 And then you'll leave here in a moment

1064
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,100
 and you'll suddenly feel like,

1065
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,500
 oh gosh, that was just a thing in the moment.

1066
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,740
 Don't allow the enemy to cause you to retreat again.

1067
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:26,020
 If you're feeling like this is your time to be open

1068
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,780
 in the week or the couple of weeks ahead,

1069
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,660
 don't let the enemy whisper back into you

1070
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,740
 to retreat you again.

1071
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,660
 I pray Lord for the blood of Jesus,

1072
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,660
 a protection over every person here

1073
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,380
 who wants to have one of those kinds of conversations

1074
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,260
 in the week ahead.

1075
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,660
 And Lord, we pray for the fruits of the love

1076
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,020
 and the light and the forgiveness

1077
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,820
 and the grace of Jesus over anything

1078
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,300
 that has been kept in darkness.

1079
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,820
 And we pray this now in Jesus' name.

1080
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,380
 Lord, I pray a releasing over your people.

1081
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,860
 And Lord, for those people

1082
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,860
 that you're raising a testimony in.

1083
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,260
 Lord, I wanna pray that they would see the avenues

1084
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,460
 and the people that they can share with.

1085
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,100
 Lord, we pray that those who are currently in our city

1086
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,420
 who are far off,

1087
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,660
 Lord, we pray that they would hear

1088
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,940
 the sound of restoration in your church.

1089
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,980
 Lord, we pray that in our spheres of influence,

1090
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,500
 in our families and the people around us, Lord,

1091
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,980
 that as we begin to proclaim the goodness

1092
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,100
 of a God who has set us free,

1093
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,780
 that we would see others say,

1094
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,540
 I wanna learn more about that.

1095
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,260
 Why do you have so much peace?

1096
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,060
 Why do you have so much joy?

1097
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,860
 And that they would go, take me, bring me,

1098
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,420
 share with me, help me, let's go out for coffee,

1099
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,100
 let's talk about this more.

1100
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,700
 Lord, I pray that you would release this church

1101
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,900
 into the city with the hope of the gospel

1102
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,780
 and the redemptive power that there is in our testimony.

1103
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,180
 Lord, thank you for what you've done in private renewal.

1104
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,180
 And we pray for the transformative power

1105
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,740
 that happens in public witness.

1106
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,940
 Lord, we pray this in Jesus' name.

1107
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,660
 Everyone says.

1108
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,500
 - Amen.

1109
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,700
 - Would you stand with me as a community

1110
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,300
 and let's just join in a place of worship before the Lord

1111
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,500
 as we thank him for what he's doing in our lives.

1112
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,080
 (upbeat music)
